<h3>ARE OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS FREE?</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Give Catholics their full rights; ask nothing of them you would not willingly concede if you
were in their place."&mdash;<cite>New York Journal of Commerce.</cite></p></div>


<p>The subject of education, the
method and extent of it, is undoubtedly
one of the foremost topics of
discussion to-day, and will be more
conspicuous than ever in the immediate
future. And, while all men are
agreed that a sound and sufficient
education of the entire people is our
only ground of hope for the perpetuity
of our rights and liberties&mdash;that,
in truth, it is vital&mdash;it is not to be
wondered at that men differing in
the depth as well as extent of their
individual culture, should also widely
differ as to the constituent elements
of a sound and sufficient education.
There are, for instance, some, as yet
happily few in number, who, in the
maze of confusion and Babel-like
discussions of sectarians and false
teachers turn their faces away in
hopeless, helpless uncertainty, and
suggest that <em>religion</em> of every name
and kind must be excluded and the
Deity himself ignored in our public
schools, so that public education
shall be <em>secular</em>; and however much
of "religion" of any and every sort
may be taught, it must be <em>in private</em>.
This is natural enough in those unfortunate
persons who so far lack a
<em>positive faith</em> that they see no safety
except in uncertainty, and hence adopt
a kind of <em>eclecticism</em> which, embracing
some abstract truth, may confessedly
also contain something of error.</p>

<p>The early settlers of this country&mdash;this
"land of liberty"&mdash;however, had
no idea of excluding religion from
the schools; and if any among them
or their immediate successors entertained
even any peculiar notions as
to what constituted religion, they
were very summarily "squelched
out."</p>

<p>Even "the great expounder of the
constitution" was in the habit of adjuring
his fellow-citizens "not to forget
the <em>religious</em> character of our
origin," and to remember that the
right to "life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness" is guaranteed to us in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
that epitome of human wisdom which
the great New Englander was born
to defend. That right it is the privilege
and the duty of each one of us
also to maintain, especially when it
is threatened under the specious pretext
of reform.</p>

<p>These and other reflections are
suggested by the perusal of a pamphlet,
a sort of campaign document,
issued by the "New York
City Council of Political Reform,"
first published in 1872, and thought
to be of consequence enough to be
reissued in the present year of grace
1873. This document contains among
others a report entitled "Sectarian
Appropriations of Public Money."
The very title of this report at once
alarms and arouses us. We are
alarmed at the dangers that menace,
and we are aroused to defend, our
rights as Americans. In this defence
we invoke the genius of liberty and
the spirit of "equal rights," and shall
fight under the "Stars and Stripes,"
the flag of freedom, till we succeed
in repelling the open as well as insidious
assaults of the enemies of that
truth which only can make us <span class="smcap">FREE</span>.</p>

<p>The ostensible and praiseworthy
purpose of the pamphlet in question
is to expose the frauds upon the city
treasury perpetrated by the late
"Tammany Ring," which, in the
person of the "boss thief of the
world," is now on trial, in a sort,
before the courts, charged with <em>robbery</em>,
<em>theft</em>, and <em>perjury</em>, but the real
purpose, the iniquitous and damnable
purpose, is intimated in the following
words of the report upon "Sectarian
Appropriations, etc.": "Over $2,273,231
taken from the treasury in 1869,
1870, 1871. One sect gets in cash
$1,915,456 92; besides public land,
$3,500,000. Total to a single sect,
$5,415,456 92." And further (on
page 10 of the same report): "Nearly
$2,000,000 of the money raised by
taxes abstracted from the public treasury
of the city and county of New
York in the last three years alone for
sectarian uses. A single sect gets
$1,396,388 51, besides a large slice
of the city's real estate."</p>

<p>This "sect" means the Catholic
Americans of the city of New York, in
numbers somewhere about 500,000,
or nearly half the population of the
city; of whom we are told elsewhere
in this same report (page 4) that,
"as a sect," it has during the last
three years, <em>by an alliance with the
Tammany Ring drawn</em> (taken, abstracted)
<em>from the public treasury, in
cash, for the support of its convents,
churches, cathedrals, church schools,
and asylums, the enormous sum of</em>
$1,396,388 51.</p>

<p>It is hardly worth while for our
present purpose to verify or to contradict
this total or the particulars
of it, for the errors into which the
report or its author has perhaps ignorantly
fallen, though not inconsiderable
in magnitude, hardly affect our
main purpose; and after all, these "inaccuracies"
may not, it is hoped, be
the result of <em>carelessness</em> solely, but are
due in some measure to the fact that
many of the "sects," while they parody
our practices, appropriate also
our names, and so may conveniently
be confounded with our Catholic institutions.</p>

<p>We will, however, point out some
which may readily be investigated.
For instance, on page 10 of the
report just mentioned, we find that
the "House of Mercy," Bloomingdale,
with a $5,000 "abstraction"
in 1869, is classed as Roman Catholic,
and it happens to be a Protestant
institution; the "Sisters of Mercy"
also, with an "abstraction" of $457,
is Protestant; "German-American
School, S. Peter's Church," with its
"abstraction" of $1,500, is Protestant;
and the "German-American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Free School," with its "abstraction"
of $14,000 in 1869, $2,496 in
1870, and $1,960 in 1871, is Protestant;
and the "German-American
School, Nineteenth Ward," with its
"abstraction" of $3,150 in 1869
and $2,700 in 1870, is Protestant;
and the "Church of Holy Name or S.
Matthew," with its "abstraction"
of $463 12, is also Protestant; and
the "Free German School," with its
"abstraction" of $5,000 in 1869,
$3,600 in 1870, and $4,480 in
1871, is also Protestant; and the
"German Mission Association," with
its "abstraction" of $5,000 in
1869, and $10,000 in 1870 and
1871, is also Protestant; besides
others, perhaps, improperly classed
as Roman Catholic. In some other
instances, the sums "abstracted"
were simply amounts of assessments
improperly laid and subsequently refunded.</p>

<p>And in connection with this suggestion
of errors may be noted,
also, among the <em>omissions</em> (suppressions,
may we not say?) the instance
of "The Society for the Reformation
of Juvenile Delinquents"
which is mentioned (on p. 16 of
the report in question) as receiving
an "abstraction" of $8,000 in
1870 and nothing in 1871. This is
a Protestant institution, and so classed
in the Report&mdash;to show, we suppose,
how small an "abstraction"
comparatively it "took." But will
the author of the report tell us how
large an "abstraction" that society
"took" of "public money"? As he
has not, and perhaps does not know,
we refer him to its annual report,
where he will find as follows, viz.:</p>

<p>making a pretty total of $70,218 53
for 1870 and $45,766 91 for 1871.</p>

<p>There is also the "New York
Juvenile Asylum," a Protestant institution,
which does not seem to be
mentioned in the report in question,
but it will be found that in 1871 it
"abstracted"</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="abstracted">
  <tr>
    <td>From the City Treasury,</td>
    <td class="tdr">$48,049 41</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td class="tdr bt">$52,065 24</td>
  </tr>
</table></div>

<p>There are other "omissions"&mdash;that of
the "abstraction" by the "Children's
Aid Society," for instance&mdash;but these
are enough for the purpose, although
it may be added that in 1872 this
institution "took" from the city
$106,238 90.</p>

<p>Our objection is not so much to
the amount "in cash" stated to have
been "taken," because the report admits
that it has not been expended
for individual or selfish purposes, but
in the maintenance and working of
schools and other beneficent institutions.
We wish, however, that the
"New York City Council of Political
Reform" had used the means at its
command to give an accurate and
<em>complete</em> statement, and we think it
would have been wiser to do so, inasmuch
as, while professedly carrying
on the purpose proclaimed in its
motto on page 1 of the report in
question, to "<span class="smcap">CHERISH, PROTECT,
AND PRESERVE THE FREE COMMON
SCHOOLS</span>," it has seen fit so unmistakably
to attack the "single sect."
Certainly, we object to the manner in
which the "sect" is charged to have
acquired its money, although having
used it so wisely. This "single
sect," comprising as it does more
than two hundred millions (or two-thirds)
of the Christian population of
the world, rather objects to the term
"sect" as applied. And if the author
will take the trouble to consult the
other Webster&mdash;not Daniel, whom we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
have already quoted&mdash;but him of the
more venerable baptismal name, he
will learn, very likely, however, not
for the first time, that the term "sect"
means "a denomination which dissents
from an established church."
And Catholics are certainly not
aware that they are "dissenters" in
the hitherto recognized sense of the
word among polemical writers.
Whether his application of the term
is malicious or simply the result of
ignorance, makes little difference; it
suited <em>him</em>, and is of no particular importance
just now to us.</p>

<p>But surely the author of the report
cannot think the amount, even as
overstated by him, to be disproportionate
to the end to be attained&mdash;"to
cherish, protect, and preserve the free
common schools," when it is added
that <em>our</em> purpose is also "to extend"
and to make our common schools
"free" indeed to all, whether Jew or
Gentile. All that we ask is to have
our equal rights in this land of equal
rights, and to extend in the broadest
manner the freedom of the public
schools, so that the rights and consciences
of none may be restricted or
violated. We ask simply that the
"money raised by taxes," so large a
portion of which we are charged to
have "abstracted," shall be divided
<i lang="la">pro rata</i>, and so, by dividing the difficulty,
conquer it! In the report, it
is admitted (p. 4) that the "enormous
sum" alleged or intimated to
have been surreptitiously "taken" or
"abstracted," was not "taken" for
the purpose of individual gain, but for
"the support of convents, churches,
cathedrals, and church schools."
What sum, <em>thus expended</em>, can be too
great? In what is it enormous? Is
it enormous because disproportioned
to the amount expended by other
"sects"? Or is it so because expended
for the support of schools
kept in "damp basements of churches,
so dark that gas has to be used on the
brightest days," rather than in the
"educational palaces" where Catholics
cannot go without a violation of
conscience, and from which they are
practically excluded?</p>

<p>And here it is notable that in the
report now under consideration (p. 2)
is printed the following, purporting
to be an extract from a report of the
"Secretary of Commissioners of
Charities" to the Legislature in 1871,
wherein it is said the secretary
"<em>refers very truthfully to the already
marked injury to the public schools of
the city of New York caused by building
up and supporting from the public
treasury so large a number of rival
sectarian schools</em>" (see <cite>Rep.</cite> pp. 99,
100). The italics are not ours.</p>

<p>Now, in the report of the Hon.
Abram B. Weaver, Superintendent of
Public Education, made in the same
year (1871), he says: "The aggregate
and the average attendance was
greater absolutely, and in proportion
to population, than in any former
year"&mdash;"... 11,700 schools were
maintained, 17,500 teachers were employed,
and about $10,000,000 were
expended" (<cite>Rep. Com. of Education</cite>,
1871, p. 291). "The average
number of pupils for the whole
state in attendance each day of the
entire term in 1870 was 16,284, more
than in 1869, etc." (p. 292). And in
New York City, we are told in the
same report (p. 301 of <cite>Report of
Commissioners of Education</cite>, 1871),
"It is interesting to note, as evidence
of the substantial progress of free
schools in New York City, that,
while the whole population of the
city has increased but about 14 per
cent. in the last ten years, the average
attendance of pupils has increased
nearly 54 per cent. in the same
time." Now, wherein consists the
<em>injury</em> complained of? While the
average attendance on the "free pub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>lic
schools" was actually increasing,
whence came the children attending
in these "damp basements of churches,"
and what necessity drove them
from the "educational palaces"? Is
the condition, in certain respects, of
our public schools such as is pictured
by the writer of the following, taken
from the New York <cite>Herald</cite> of Feb. 9,
1873:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">"PUBLIC-SCHOOL ABUSES.
</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">To the Editor of the Herald</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>"Your articles on school ventilation
have my hearty approval. I have sent
my two youngest boys for two successive
winters to the boys' school on Thirteenth
street, near Sixth avenue (primary department),
but each time they remained from
one to two weeks, and then had to remain
home, owing to a severe cold or inflammation
of the lungs, which kept them
away for weeks. Having tried the school
thus I was compelled to remove them
this winter to a private school, where
they have attended regularly and have
been in good health. No judgment is
used in that department in regard to ventilation.
Sometimes the room is excessively
warm; at other times the windows
on both sides of the house are opened,
and the current of cold air descending on
the heads of the children causes catarrhal
affections and pneumonia.</p>

<p>"Such complaints as the following have
been made about the girls' school,
Twelfth street, near University place.
A continual system of stealing is going
on after they leave in the afternoon. The
desks locked up are opened and articles
removed, even books as well as other
things, and if anything is accidentally
left by the scholars it is always gone
before morning. Nothing is safe in that
school, and the question is, who steals
it? Complaints, I understand, have been
made, but no steps taken to correct it
again.</p>

<p>"The Board of Education is frequently
applied to for necessary books and material
for conducting the school, and they
are not supplied. No notice is taken.
The teachers have to purchase themselves
the necessary articles, or go without. At
present, to my knowledge, an important
part of a teacher's duty is prevented
being fulfilled by reason of not having
the necessary material. Teachers are
afraid of complaining for fear of losing
their situations.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Amicus.</span>"</p>
</div>

<p>Or this, taken from the New York
<cite>Telegram</cite> of February 13, 1873:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"An association has been formed by
the women of Washington, called 'The
Society for Moral Education,' which has
for its object the proper education and
mental development of the children of
the country. The society holds regular
meetings, and proposes to become a national
organization. Mrs. L. B. Chandler,
of Boston, is the inspiring genius of
the movement. The members of the society,
in an appeal for support, say: 'As
women, teachers, and mothers, we feel it
incumbent upon us, in view of the alarming
prevalence of intemperance and various
frightful social vices, the increase
of pernicious knowledge among children
and youth, the general ill-health of women,
the large number of diseased, deformed,
idiotic children born, and the appalling
mortality of infants, to seek the
means whereby future generations may
be blessed with better knowledge of the
laws of life, wiser and stronger parents,
and a purer social state."</p></div>

<p>Or this, from Prof. Agassiz, embodied
in an editorial article of the Boston
<cite>Herald</cite> of October 20, 1871:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Year after year the chief of police
publishes his statistics of prostitution in
this city, but how few of the citizens bestow
more than a passing thought upon
the misery that they represent! Although
these figures are large enough to
make every lover of humanity hang his
head with feelings of sorrow and shame
at the picture, we are assured that they
represent but a little, as it were, of the
actual licentiousness that prevails among
all classes of society. Within a few
months, a gentleman (Prof. Agassiz)
whose scientific attainments have made
his name a household word in all lands,
has personally investigated the subject,
and the result has filled him with dismay,
when he sees the depths of degradation
to which men and women have
fallen; he has almost lost faith in the
boasted civilization of the XIXth century.
In the course of his inquiries, he
has visited both the well-known 'houses
of pleasure' and the 'private establish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>ments'
scattered all over the city. He
states that he has a list of both, with the
street and number, the number of inmates,
and many other facts that would
perfectly astonish the people if made
public. He freely conversed with the inmates,
and the life histories that were revealed
were sad indeed. To his utter
surprise, a large proportion of the 'soiled
doves' <em>traced their fall to influences that
met them in the public schools</em>, and although
Boston is justly proud of its
schools, it would seem from his story
that they need a thorough purification."</p></div>

<p>Or are we driven to the conclusion
that the "injury" complained
of is like that which was chronicled
so long ago, as suffered by Haman
at the hands of Mordecai?</p>

<p>"A single sect gets $1,396,388.51,
besides a large slice of the city's real
estate." This, of course, refers to the
cathedral lots. That this "large
slice" was fairly obtained, in the customary
way of business, more than
half a century ago, and at a time
when no "Tammany Ring" existed,
and when this "same sect" had no
regularly consecrated place of worship
in this city, so insignificant were
its numbers, is notoriously a matter
of record&mdash;known, indeed, of all men
who choose to know; and the statement
made in the "report" has
been so often refuted, that the repetition
of it now is disgraceful, and is
simply a lie "well stuck to." As to
the other leases mentioned "at a
nominal rental," what matters it to
anybody but Haman so long as the
property, however now increased in
value for building sites or other material
advantage to the "money-changers,"
is devoted, as the report
in question expressly admits, to the
cause of education&mdash;of the education
of "the children whose poverty prevented
them from attending the public
schools for want of clothing, and
in many cases even of food"&mdash;as we
are told in the following extract from
the last published <cite>Report</cite> of the
Board of Public Instruction (city of
New York) for 1871 (page 14): "It
will be seen from the preceding statement"
(showing the average attendance
at the schools under the jurisdiction
of the Board to be, for 1871,
103,481, and in 1870, 103,824) "that
the attendance at the public schools
has not increased, which is readily
explained by the fact that many
benevolent and charitable institutions
have entered the educational field.
In these institutions the children whose
poverty prevented them from attending
the public schools for want of
clothing, and in many cases even of
food, are provided for."</p>

<p>In the same pamphlet from which
we have quoted is also another "Document,"
designated "No. 4," embodying
what purports to be a report
made to the "State Council of Political
Reform" in 1870 by "the Committee
on Endowment and Support by the
State of Sectarian Institutions." This
"report" contains, among other quotations
from Aristotle, Washington,
Jay, De Witt Clinton, Chancellor
Kent, Milton, Lord Brougham, Guizot,
and Horace Mann, many of
which are so generally known and
accepted as to have become truisms,
one notable extract from Thomas
Jefferson, which embodies very nearly
all that Catholics desire and are contending
for. Jefferson says: "A system
of general instruction which shall
reach every description of our citizens
from the richest to the poorest ...
give it to us in any shape." This is
what <em>we</em> ask. We make no war; we
have no "plan of attack" upon the
public schools, as charged upon page
5 of this Document No. 4; our chief
desire is simply that expressed in the
words already quoted from Thomas
Jefferson; and, with the "sectarians,"
we deny that the system now in use
is sufficiently "general" to accomplish
the purpose intended, or that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
can be called a general system while
it excludes any class whose positive
religious convictions must necessarily
be daily interfered with by what is
called an "unsectarian" method of
instruction. We believe, as did the
Puritan fathers, that a knowledge of
and an obedience to the divine
government are essential in fitting
each child "to be a citizen of a free
and tolerant republic." We believe
in our right to say how and by whom
such knowledge shall be given and
such obedience shall be taught, and
we also believe that we are quite as
competent to determine our methods
and to select our teachers as is any
political party now in being or ever
likely to be. We are quite as strongly
opposed to the establishment of any
"state religion" as this self-elected
body of political reformers are or
affect to be; and, to quote and apply
to this body the words of "Document
No. 4," "we cannot yield one
jot or tittle of their demand, for it
involves a principle to us sacred and
vital. It means the union of church
and state." And we refer to history
for the proof that the Catholic has
never been a state church, but has
been more frequently found in antagonism
to the civil power than in
alliance with it; always on the side
of liberty and the rights of the people;
shielding them from oppression, even
to the deposing of unjust rulers; enforcing
their rights, even to the extent
of aiding to make war upon tyrants;
and yet, despite this teaching of history,
we are told (on page 8 of the
Document first referred to), under
the pretence of saying why we "make
war upon the public schools," as follows:
"But a single sect is taught by
its head, a foreign and despotic ecclesiastical
prince, that the civil authorities
in a republic have not the
right to direct and control the course
of study, and the choice and appointment
of teachers in the public schools,
open alike to the youth of all classes,
but that this right belongs to the
church." Now, this is merely a specious
falsehood. For, let us ask what
is here meant by "the civil authorities"?
Does the phrase mean "the
state," which, we are also told, is a
better educator than the church; or
does it mean that aggregation of individuals,
each being represented and
having an equal voice, composing
"the state"? If the latter is the
meaning, what Catholic American
denies the right or asserts it for "the
church" exclusively? We are yet
to meet him.</p>

<p>Catholics, and others not Catholics,
do deny that "the state" is the best
educator, to the exclusion of the
church; and they do their best to
maintain the rights of minorities as
against the tyranny of majorities.</p>

<p>There are certain words and
phrases used in this "Document No.
4" which we do not altogether like;
as, for instance: "The state a better
educator than the church"; for, in
the light of certain events not long
since occurring here and in Washington,
"the state" has come to be used,
and perhaps understood, in a sense
of which we are somewhat suspicious.
The doctrine of "centralization" is
slowly becoming something more
than <em>theory</em> with a certain class of
politicians and office-holders; and
the words, "the state," the "civil
authorities," and the "government,"
are beginning to have an ominous
ring in our ears.</p>

<p>To be sure, when we are told, in a
somewhat dogmatic way, that "the
state is a better educator than the
church," we <em>may</em> infer from the text
illustrating the dogma (page 8, Document
No. 4) that in this connection
the state is manifest in the persons of
the public-school authorities, and that
<em>they</em> are a power in opposition to "a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
sect" or to "sects." And when our
public schools are "open alike to
youth of all classes," of all creeds,
and Catholics are fairly represented
among "school authorities," and are
allowed an equal voice in direction
and control, and in the choice of
teachers&mdash;in short, when they have
their rights as component parts and
members of "the state," we shall
probably hear no more about this
"war upon the public schools," but
until then probably this clamor for
their rights will still be heard.</p>

<p>All this talk, however, about secularizing
education means nothing
more nor less than the divorcement
of religion from all public education;
and it remains to be seen how far
the descendants and the heirs of that
people who asserted that liberty of
conscience and freedom to worship
God (even in the school-room) meant
something, and are paramount, will
tolerate this "new departure."</p>

<p>The Catholic barons of England
wrung from King John at Runnymede
the famous <cite>Magna Charta</cite>, and
the Catholic settlers of Maryland
gave the first constitution recognizing
equal rights for all men; and the
"Church of Rome," as a British
Presbyterian writer has said, "has always
been an 'independent, distinct,
and often opposing power'; and that
civil liberty is closely connected with
religious liberty&mdash;with the church being
independent of the state." Every
school-boy might and ought to be
taught these and other like facts, for
history mentions them; and the assailants
of the Catholic Church ought
to be ashamed to ignore or deny
them. And yet such ignorance and
such denials are the capital in trade
of the bigots and the fanatics who
fear and affect to see in the spread
of Catholicism a menace to our liberties.</p>

<p>On page 5 of this "Document
No. 4" we are told that "the moment
the state takes under its protection
any church, by appropriating public
money or property to the uses or
support of that church, or the teaching
of its peculiar tenets or practices,
it in that act, and to that extent,
unites church and state. The union
of church and state, in all ages and
in all countries, has led to oppression
and bloodshed." Now, if this is not
arrant nonsense, what is?</p>

<p>The practice of "appropriating
public money or property" to churches,
so called, is coeval with our national
birth. And in this country church
and state have, according to the
logic of this statement, been very
much united&mdash;very much married,
like Brigham Young and his multitudinous
wives&mdash;and yet the "oppression
and bloodshed" sure to follow
have not yet come upon us&mdash;in fact,
"churches" and state have always
in this country been united, and we
did not know it! Through what unknown
dangers have we passed!</p>

<p>This "Document No. 4" is not
honest in this kind of talk&mdash;the
union of church and state means a
form of religion established by law,
and pains and penalties inflicted
upon dissenters.</p>

<p>Not a great many years ago, in
Prussia, of which we hear so much
upon the "educational question," by
command of the king, the "Prussian
Calvinist and Lutheran, who had
quarrelled for three hundred years
about the real presence and predestination,
abandoned their disputes,
denied their faith, and became members
of the 'Evangelical Church of
Prussia'"&mdash;a church whose simple
creed is thus stated: "Do ye believe
in God? then must ye believe in
Christ. Do ye believe in Christ?
then must ye believe in the king. He
is our head on earth, and rules
by the order of God. The king has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
appeared in the flesh in our native
land!" This was a state religion&mdash;a
union of church and state, and is
about as likely to be established here
as that the "Document No. 4" is to
be adopted as a text-book in our
public schools. This union of church
and state is about as sensible a cry,
and quite as malignant, as the old
"No Jews, no wooden shoes!" addressed
to the mob in England, and is
framed and uttered in the spirit of the
same "sectarian" and bigoted hate.</p>

<p>Now, one word as to "secular
education"&mdash;there is no such thing,
if God's work is our work. If his
glory requires the dedication of all
the powers he has given us, it is
preposterous to talk about an education
from which he and his existence,
and the knowledge of him and his
purposes and laws, are excluded.
We may endow, and send our children
to colleges where no priest or
clergyman shall ever come, and no
creed shall be taught or even mentioned,
and call the education there
received secular and unsectarian, as
was intended to be done at the
"Girard College" at Philadelphia,
and yet we shall find the education
unsatisfactory, and no "state" has
yet adopted the plan.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we demand, in the
language of the resolutions "unanimously
adopted" and appended to
the report in "Document No. 4,"
"... free of cost, to every child in
the state, a generous and tolerant
education&mdash;such an education as
qualifies him for the duties of citizenship";
and, moreover, such an
education as shall recognize and
protect the first and most important
of all the <em>rights</em> of citizenship&mdash;the
right of conscience, which is grossly
violated by the system of atheistical
education.</p>

<h3>GRAPES AND THORNS</h3>

<p class="center">BY THE AUTHOR OF "THE HOUSE OF YORKE."</p>


<h4>CHAPTER V.<br />

SHADOWS AND LILIES.</h4>

<p>Mr. Schöninger came early to the
rehearsal that evening, and, in his
stately fashion, made himself unusually
agreeable. There was, perhaps,
a very slight widening of the eyes,
expressive of surprise, if not of displeasure,
when he saw Miss Ferrier's
critics, but his salutation did not
lack any necessary courtesy. He
did not lose his equanimity even
when, later, while they were singing
a fugue passage, a sonorous but
stupid bass came in enthusiastically
just one bar too soon.</p>

<p>"I am glad you chose to do that
to-night instead of to-morrow night,
sir," the director said quietly. "Now
we will try it again."</p>

<p>And yet Mr. Schöninger was, in
his profession, an object of terror to
some of his pupils, and of scrupulous,
if not anxious, attention to all; for
not only did he possess notably that
exalted musical sensitiveness which
no true artist lacks, but he concealed
under an habitual self-control, and
great exactness in the discharge of
his duty, a fiery impatience of temper,
and a hearty dislike for the
drudgery of his profession.</p>

<p>"If your doctrines regarding future
punishments are true," he once
said to F. Chevreuse, "then the physical
part of a musician's purgatory
will be to listen to discords striving
after, but never attaining to, harmony,
and his hell to hear sublime harmonies
rent and distorted by discords.
I never come so near believing in an
embodied spirit of evil as when I
hear a masterpiece of one of the
great composers mangled by a tyro.
I haven't a doubt that Chopin or Schumann
might be played so as to throw
me into convulsions."</p>

<p>And F. Chevreuse had answered
after his kind: "And your spiritual
purgatory, sir, will be the recollection
of those long years during which
you have persisted in playing with
one thumb, as a bleak monody, that
divine trio of which all the harmonies
of the universe are but faint echoes."</p>

<p>Nothing of this artistic irritability
appeared to-night, as we have said.
In its stead was a gentleness quite
new in the musician's demeanor, and
so slight as to be like that first film
of coming verdure on the oak, when,
some spring morning, one looks out
and doubts whether it is a dimness
of the eyes or the atmosphere, or a
budding foliage which has set swimming
those sharp outlines of branch
and twig.</p>

<p>"He is really human," Annette
whispered to Miss Pembroke; and
Honora smiled acquiescence, though
she would scarcely have employed
such an expression for her thought.
She had already discovered in Mr.
Schöninger a very gentle humanity.</p>

<p>Low as the whisper was, his ears
caught it, and two sharp eyes, watching
him, saw an almost imperceptible
tremor of the eyelids, which was
the only sign he gave. The owner
of these eyes did not by any means
approve of the manner in which their
leader had given Miss Pembroke her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
music that evening, leaving the other
ladies to be served as they might;
still less did she approve of the coldness
with which her own coquettish
demands on his attention had been
met. It was scarcely worth while to
submit to the drudgery of rehearsing,
in a chorus too, if that was to be
all the return. Rising carelessly,
therefore, and allowing the sheet
of music on her lap to fall unheeded
to the floor, Miss Carthusen sauntered
off toward where Miss Ferrier's
two critics sat apart, talking busily,
having, apparently, as she had anticipated,
written their reports of the rehearsal
before coming to it.</p>

<p>These critics were a formidable
pair, for they criticised everybody
and everything. One of them added
to a man's sarcasm a woman's finer
malice, which pricks with the needlepoint.
Dr. Porson was a tall, aquiline-faced,
choleric man, with sharp eyes
that, looking through a pair of clear
and remarkably lustrous glasses, saw
the chink in everybody's armor.
Those who knew him would rather
see lightning than meet the flash of his
glasses turned on them, and feel the
probing glances that shot through,
and thunder would have been music
to their ears compared to the short
laugh that greeted a sinister discovery.</p>

<p>The other was Mr. Sales, the new
editor of <cite>The Aurora</cite>, a little wasp of
a man. He had twinkling black eyes
that needed no lens to assist their
vision, and a thin-lipped mouth with
a slim black moustache hanging at
either corner, like a strong pen-dash
made with black ink. Dr. Porson
called them quotation-marks, and
had a way of smoothing imaginary
moustaches on his own clean-shaven
face whenever the younger man said
any very good thing without giving
credit for it.</p>

<p>"A clever little eclectic," the doctor
said of him. "He pilfers with the
best taste in the world, and, with the
innocence of a babe, believes everybody
else to be original. He never
writes anything worth reading but I
want to congratulate him on his
'able scissors.' 'Able scissors' is not
mine," the doctor added, "but it is
good. I found it in <cite>Blackwood's</cite>."</p>

<p>These two gentlemen had arrived
early, and, seated apart, in a side-window
of the long drawing-room,
crunched the people between their
teeth as they entered. Between the
morsels, the doctor enlightened his
companion, a new-comer in the city,
regarding Crichton and the Crichtonians.</p>

<p>"There's little Jones, the most irritating
person I know," the doctor
said. "By what chance he should
have that robust voice I cannot imagine.
Sometimes I think it doesn't
come out of his own throat, but that
he has a large ventriloquist whom
he carries about with him. I
shouldn't wonder if the fellow were
now just outside that open sash.
Did you see the way he marched
past us, all dickey and boot-heels?
A man who is but five feet high has
no right to assume six-foot manners;
he has scarcely the right to exist at
all among well-grown people. Besides,
they always wear large hats.
Not but I respect a small stature in
a clever person," he admitted, with a
side glance at Mr. Sales' slight figure.
"We don't wish to have our diamonds
by the hundredweight. But
common, pudding-stone men must be
in imposing masses, or we want
them cleared away as <em>débris</em>."</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Schöninger a pudding-stone
man?" the young editor asked,
when that gentleman had passed
them by.</p>

<p>Dr. Porson's face unconsciously
dropped its mocking. "If you
should strike Mr. Schöninger in any
way," he said, "you would find him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
flint. The only faults I see in the
man are his excessive caution and
secretiveness. He is here, evidently,
only to get all the money he can,
and, when he has enough, will wash
his hands of us; therefore, wishes
for no intimacies. That is my interpretation.
He is a gentleman, however.
A man must have the most
perfect politeness of soul to salute
Mme. Ferrier as he did. While they
were speaking together, she actually
had the air of a lady. See her look
after him. It is an art which we
critics cannot learn, sir, that of setting
people in their best light. Of course
it would spoil our trade if we did
learn it; but, for all that, we miss
something. Schöninger is a Jew,
to be sure, but that signifies nothing.
Each one to his taste. We
no longer trouble ourselves about
people's faith. When you say that a
man believes this or that, it's as
though you said, he eats this or that.
The world moves. Why, sir, a few
years ago, we wouldn't have spoken
to a man who ate frogs any more
than to a cannibal; and now we are
so fond of the little reptiles that
there isn't a frog left to sing in the
swamps."</p>

<p>"But," Mr. Sales objected, "society
has established certain rules&mdash;"
then stopped, finding himself in deep
water.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," the doctor replied,
as gravely as though something
had been said. "The Flat-head Indians
now, who seem to have understood
the science of phrenology,
think it the proper thing to have a
plateau on the top of the head.
Their reason is, probably, a moral
rather than an æsthetic one. They
know that the peaceful and placable
qualities, those which impel a man
to let go, are kept in little chambers
in the front top of the brain. They
have other use for their attics. So
they just clap a board on the baby's
soft head, and press the space meant
for such useless stuff as benevolence
and reverence back, so as to increase
the storage for the noble qualities of
firmness and self-esteem. That is
one of the rules of their society; and
I have always considered it a most
striking and beautiful instance of the
proper employment of means to an
end. There is a certain sublime and
simple directness in it. No circuitous,
century-long labor of trying to
square the fluid contents of a round
vessel, but just a board on the head.
That, sir, should be the first step
in evangelizing the heathen&mdash;shape
their heads. When you want a man
to think in a certain way, put a
strong pressure on his contradictory
bumps, and preach to him afterwards.
That's what I tell our minister,
Mr. Atherton. There he is now,
that bald man with the fair hair.
He is a glorious base. His great-grandfather
was a conceited Anglo-Saxon,
and he's the fourth power of
him. The reason why he does not
believe in the divinity of Christ is
because he was not of Anglo-Saxon
birth."</p>

<p>Here, across the <em>pianissimo</em> chorus
which made the vocal accompaniment
of an Alp-song, Miss Ferrier's
brilliant voice flashed like lightning
in clear, sharp zigzags, startling the
two into silence.</p>

<p>"That wasn't bad," the doctor
said when she ended.</p>

<p>The younger gentleman applauded
with such enthusiasm that Annette
blushed with pleasure. "She needs
but one thing to make her voice perfect,"
he said, "and that is a great
sorrow."</p>

<p>"Yes, as I was telling you some
time ago," the doctor resumed, "we
are a liberal and hospitable people
in Crichton. We have no prejudices.
Everybody is welcome, even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
devil. We are æsthetic, too. We admire
the picturesque. We wouldn't
object to seeing an interesting
family of children shot with arrows,
provided they would fall with a
grace, and their mother would assume
the true Niobe attitude. In literature,
too, how we shine! We have
reached the sublime of the superficial.
There's your Miss Carthusen, now,
with her original poetry. How
nicely she dished up that conceit
of Montaigne's, that somebody is
peculiar because he has no peculiarities.
I've forgotten, it is so long
since I read him. I haven't looked
over the new edition that this poetess
of ours has peeped into and fished
a fancy out of. But yesterday I was
charmed to see it scintillating, in
rhymed lines, in the Olympian corner
of <cite>The Aurora</cite>, over the well-known
signature of <em>Fleur-de-lis</em>."</p>

<p>The young man looked mortified.
He had never read Montaigne, and
had announced this production as
original and remarkable, firmly believing
the writer to be a genius.
But he did not choose to tell Dr.
Porson that.</p>

<p>"What would you?" he asked,
raising his eyebrows and his voice in
a philosophical manner. "I must fill
the paper; and it is better to put in
good thought at second-hand than
flat originals. How many know the
difference?"</p>

<p>Here Annette's voice stopped
them again.</p>

<p>"Strange that girl sings so well
to-night," said the doctor, adjusting
his glasses for a clearer glance. "She
looks well, too. Must be the inspiration
of her lover's presence. That's
the kind of fellow, sir, that a woman
takes a fancy to&mdash;a pale, beautiful
young man with a slouched hat and
a secret sorrow, the sorrow usually
having reference to the pocket."</p>

<p>Lawrence Gerald sat near his lady,
and seemed to be absorbed in his occupation
of cutting a rosebud across
in thin slices with his pocket-knife, a
proceeding his mother viewed with
gentle distress. But when the song
was ended, he looked up at Annette
and smiled, seeming to be rather
proud of her. And, looking so, his
eyes lingered a little, expressing
interest and a slight surprise, as if
he beheld there something worth
looking at which he had not noticed
before. Had he cared to observe,
he might have known already that
Miss Ferrier had moments of being
beautiful. This was one of them.</p>

<p>There is a pain that looks like
delight, when the heart bleeds into
the cheeks, the lips part with a smile
that does not touch the eyes, and
the eyes shine with a dazzling
brilliancy that may well be mistaken
for joyousness. With such feverish
beauty Annette was radiant this
evening, and the excitement of singing
and of applause had added the
last touch of brightness.</p>

<p>The programme for the concert
was chiefly of popular music, or a
kind of old-fashioned music they
were making popular, part-songs and
glees. They had attained great
finish and delicacy in executing these,
and the effect was charming, and
far preferable to operas and operatic
airs as we usually hear them. It
would have been a bold woman who
would have asked Mr. Schöninger's
permission to sing a difficult <em>aria</em>.
Annette had once made such a request,
but with indifferent success.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," the teacher replied,
"you have a better voice than
either of the Pattis; but a voice is
only a beginning. You must learn
the alphabet of music before you
can read its poems. When you are
ready to be a Norma, I will resign
you to some teacher who knows
more than I do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>The singing was at an end, and
the singers left their seats and wandered
about the house and garden.
Only Mr. Schöninger lingered by the
piano, and, seeing him still there, no
one went far away, those outside
leaning in at the window.</p>

<p>He seated himself presently, and
played a Polonaise. He sat far back,
almost at arm's length from the keys,
and, as he touched it, the instrument
seemed to possess an immortal soul.
One knew not which most to admire,
the power that made a single piano
sound like an orchestra, or the delicacy
that produced strains fine and
clear like horns of fairyland.</p>

<p>When he had finished, he went to
ask Mrs. Gerald how the singing had
gone.</p>

<p>"I observed that you listened," he
remarked, being within Dr. Porson's
hearing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gerald had been sitting for
the last half-hour beside Mrs. Ferrier,
and the time had been penitential,
as all her intercourse with Annette's
mother was. It was hard for
a fond mother and a sensitive lady
to listen to such indelicate complaints
and insinuations as Mrs. Ferrier
was constantly addressing to her
when they were together without
uttering any sharp word in return.
To be reminded that Lawrence was
making a very advantageous marriage
without retorting that she
would be far more happy to see him
the husband of Honora Pembroke,
required an effort; and to restrain
the quick flash, or the angry tears
in her fiery Celtic heart when she
heard him undervalued, was almost
more than she could do. But she
had conquered herself for God's sake
and for her son's sake, perhaps a
little for pride's sake, had given the
soft answer when she could, and remained
silent when speech seemed
too great an effort.</p>

<p>That coarse insolence of mere
money to refined poverty, and the
mistaking equality before the law for
personal equality, are at any time
sufficiently offensive; how much
more so when the victim is in some
measure in the tormentor's power.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gerald's face showed how
severe the trial had been. Her blue
eyes had the unsteady lustre of a
dew that dared not gather into tears,
a painful smile trembled on her lips,
and her cheeks were scarlet. Had
she been at liberty, this lady could
perfectly well have known how to
ignore or reprove impertinence without
ruffling her smooth brow or
losing her tranquil manner; but she
was not free, and the restraint was
agitating. This rude woman's rudest
insinuation was but truth, and she
must bear it. Yet, mother-like, she
never thought of reproaching her son
for what she suffered.</p>

<p>"I never heard music I liked so
well," she said to Mr. Schöninger's
question. "We are under obligation
to you for giving us what we can understand.
The composition you have
just played delighted me, too, though
it is probable that I do not at all
appreciate its beauties. It made
me think of fairies dancing in a
ring."</p>

<p>"It was a dance-tune," Mr. Schöninger
said, pleased that she had perceived
the thought; for it required
a fine and sympathetic ear to discern
the step in that capricious movement
of Chopin's.</p>

<p>The fact that he was a Jew had
prevented her looking on this man
with any interest, or feeling it possible
that any friendship could exist
between them; but the thought
passed her mind, as he spoke, that
Mr. Schöninger might be a very
amiable person if he chose. There
was a delicate and reserved sweetness
in that faint smile of his which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
reminded her of some expression she
had seen on Honora's face, when she
was conversing with a gentleman
who had the good fortune to please
her.</p>

<p>Meantime, Lawrence had been
having a little dispute with Annette.
"What's this about the wine?" he
whispered to her. "John says there
isn't any to be had."</p>

<p>He looked astonished, and with
reason, for the fault of the Ferrier
entertainments had always been their
profusion.</p>

<p>"I meant to have told you that I
had concluded not to have wine,"
she said. "Two gentlemen present
are intemperate men, who make their
families very unhappy, and when
they begin to drink they do not
know where to stop. The last time
Mr. Lane was here he became really
quite unsteady before he went
away."</p>

<p>"But the others!" Lawrence exclaimed.
"What will they think?"</p>

<p>"They may understand just why
it is," she replied; "and they may
not think anything about it. I
should not imagine that they need
occupy their minds very long with
the subject."</p>

<p>"Why, you must know, Annette,
that some of them come here for
nothing but the supper, and chiefly
the wine," the young man urged
unguardedly.</p>

<p>She drew up slightly. "So I have
heard, Lawrence; and I wish to discourage
such visitors' coming. People
who are in the devouring mood
should not go visiting; they are
disagreeable. I have never seen
in company that liveliness which
comes after supper without a feeling
of disgust. It may not go beyond
proper bounds, but still it is a greater
or less degree of intoxication. I
have provided everything I could
think of for their refreshment and
cheering, but nothing to make them
tipsy. I gave you a good reason at
first, Lawrence, and I have a better.
My father died of liquor, and my
brother is becoming a slave to it.
I will help to make no drunkards."</p>

<p>"Well," the young man sighed
resignedly, "you mean well; but I
can't help thinking you a little quixotic."</p>

<p>"The Ferriers are giving us <i lang="fr">eau
sucrée</i> instead of wine to-night,"
sneered one of the company to Mr.
Schöninger, a while after.</p>

<p>"They show good taste in doing
so," he replied coldly. "There are always
bar-rooms and drinking-saloons
enough for those who are addicted to
drink. I never wish to take wine
from the hand of a lady, nor to drink
it in her presence."</p>

<p>The night was brilliantly full-moonlighted,
and so warm that they had
lit as little gas as possible. A soft
glow from the upper floor, and the
bright doors of the drawing-room,
made the hall chandelier useless.
Miss Ferrier's new organ there was
flooded with a silvery radiance that
poured through a window. Mr.
Schöninger came out and seated
himself before it.</p>

<p>"Shall I play a fugue of Bach's?"
he asked of Miss Pembroke, who was
standing in the open door leading to
the garden.</p>

<p>She took a step toward him, into
the shadow between moonlight of
window and door, and the light
seemed to follow her, lingering in her
fair face and her white dress. Even
the waxen jasmine blossoms in her
hair appeared to be luminous.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "if you are to
play only once more; but, if more
than once, let that be last. I never
lose the sound and motion of one of
Bach's fugues till I have slept; and
I like to keep the murmur it leaves,
as if my ears were sea-shells."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>She went back to stand in the door,
but, after a few minutes, stepped softly
and slowly further away, and passed
by the drawing-room doors, through
which she saw Annette talking with
animation and many gestures, while
her two critics listened and nodded
occasional acquiescence, and Lawrence
withdrawn to a window-seat
with Miss Carthusen, and Mrs. Ferrier
the centre of a group of young
people, who listened to her with ill-concealed
smiles of amusement. At
length she found the place she
wanted, an arm-chair under the front
portico, and, seated there, gathered
up that strong, wilful rush of harmony
as a whole. It did not seem to have
ceased when Mr. Schöninger joined
her. She was so full of the echoes
of his music that for a moment she
looked at him standing beside her as
if it had been his wraith.</p>

<p>He pointed silently and smiling to
the corner of the veranda visible from
where they sat. It was on the shady
side of the house, and still further
screened by vines, and the half-drawn
curtains of the window looking into it
allowed but a single beam of gaslight
to escape. In that nook were
gathered half a dozen children, peeping
into the drawing-room. They
were as silent as the shadows in which
they lurked, and their bare feet had
given no notice of their coming.
Their bodies were almost invisible,
but their eager little faces shone in
the red light, and now and then a
small hand was lifted into sight.</p>

<p>"It reminds me," he said, "of a
passage in the Koran, where Mahomet
declares that it had been revealed
to him that a company of genii had
listened while he was reading a chapter,
and that one of them had remarked:
'Verily, we have heard
a most admirable discourse.' That
amused me; and I fancied that an
effective picture might be made of
it: the prophet reading at night
by the light of an antique lamp that
shone purely on his solemn face and
beard, and his green robe, with, perhaps,
the pet cat curled round on the
sleeve. The casement should be open
wide, and crowded with a multitude
of yearning, exquisite faces, the lips
parted with the intensity of their listening.
As I came along the hall
just now, I saw one of those children
through the window, and in that
light it looked like a cameo cut in
pink coral."</p>

<p>"I fancy they are some of my children,"
Miss Pembroke said, and rose.
"Let us see. They ought not to be
out so late, nor to intrude."</p>

<p>"Oh! spare the poor little wretches,"
Mr. Schöninger said laughingly,
as she took his arm. "We find this
commonplace enough, but to them it
is wonderful. I think we might be
tempted to trespass a little if we
could get a peep into veritable fairyland.
This is to them fairyland."</p>

<p>"That anything is a strong temptation
is no excuse for yielding," the
lady said in a playful tone that took
away any appearance of reproof from
her words. "We do not go into
battle in order to surrender without
a struggle, nor to surrender at
all, but to become heroes. I must
teach my little ones to have heroic
thoughts."</p>

<p>The children, engrossed in the
bright scene within, did not perceive
any approach from without till all
retreat was cut off for them, and they
turned, with startled faces, to find
themselves confronted by a tall gentleman,
on whose arm leaned a lady
whom they looked up to with a tender
but reverent love.</p>

<p>These children were of a class
accustomed to a word and a blow,
and their instinctive motion was to
shrink back into a corner, and hide
their faces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am sorry to see you here, my
dears," she said. "Please go home
now, like good children."</p>

<p>That was her way of reproving.</p>

<p>She stood aside, and the little vagabonds
shied out past her, each one
trying to hide his face, and scampering
off on soundless feet as soon as
he had reached the ground.</p>

<p>"So you have a school?" Mr.
Schöninger asked, as they went
round through the garden.</p>

<p>They came out into the moonlight,
and approached the rear of the
house, where a number of the company
were gathered, standing among
the flowers.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have fifty, or more, of
these little ones, and I find it interesting.
They were in danger of
growing up in the street, and I had
nothing else to do&mdash;that is, nothing
that seemed so plain a duty. So I
took the largest room in an old
house of mine just verging on the region
where these children live, and
have them come there every day."</p>

<p>"You must find teaching laborious,"
the gentleman said.</p>

<p>"Oh! no. I am strong and
healthy, and I do not fatigue myself
nor them. The whole is free
to them, of course, and I am responsible
to no one, therefore can
instruct or amuse them in my own
way. As far as possible, I wish to
supply the incompetency of their mothers.
If I give the little ones a
happy hour, during which they behave
properly, and teach them one
thing, I am satisfied. One of the
branches I try to instruct them in is
neatness. No soiled face is allowed
to speak to me, nor soiled hands to
touch me. Then they sing and
read, and learn prayers and a little
doctrine, and I tell them stories.
When the Christian Brothers and the
Sisters of Notre Dame come, my occupation
will of course be gone."</p>

<p>"I wish I might some time be allowed
to visit this school of yours,"
Mr. Schöninger said hesitatingly. "I
could give them a singing-lesson,
and tell them a story. Little Rose
Tracy likes my stories."</p>

<p>Miss Pembroke was thoughtful a
moment, then consented. She had
witnessed with approval Mr. Schöninger's
treatment of Miss Carthusen
that evening, and respected him for
it. "The day after to-morrow, in
the afternoon, would be a good
time," she said. "It is to be a sort
of holiday, on account of the firemen's
procession. The procession
passes the school-room, and I have
promised the children that they shall
watch it."</p>

<p>They went in to take leave, for
the company was breaking up.</p>

<p>"Oh! by the way, Mr. Schöninger,"
Annette said, recollecting, "did
you get the shawl you left here at
the last rehearsal? It was thrown on
a garden-seat, and forgotten."</p>

<p>"Yes; I stepped in early the next
morning, and took it," he said. His
countenance changed slightly as he
spoke. The eyelids drooped, and
his whole air expressed reserve.</p>

<p>"The next morning!" she repeated
to herself, but said nothing.</p>

<p>Lawrence went off with Miss Carthusen;
and as Mrs. Gerald and
Honora went out at the same time
with Mr. Schöninger, he asked permission
to accompany them.</p>

<p>"How lovely the night is!" Mrs.
Gerald murmured, as they walked
quietly along under the trees of the
avenue, and saw all the beautiful city
bathed in moonlight, and ringed
about with mountains like a wall.
"Heaven can scarcely have a greater
physical beauty than earth has sometimes."</p>

<p>"I do not think," the gentleman
said, "that heaven will be so much
more beautiful than earth, but our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
eyes will be opened to see the beauties
that exist."</p>

<p>He spoke very quietly, with an air
of weariness or depression; and,
when they reached home, bowed his
good-night without speaking.</p>

<p>The two ladies stood a moment in
the door, looking out over the town.
"If that man were not a Jew, I
should find him agreeable," Mrs.
Gerald said. "As it is, it seems odd
that we should see so much of him."</p>

<p>"I am inclined to believe," Honora
said slowly, "that it is not right
for us to refuse a friendly intercourse
with suitable associates on account
of any difference of religion, unless
they intrude on us a belief or disbelief
which we hold to be sacrilegious."</p>

<p>"Could you love a Jew?" Mrs.
Gerald asked, rather abruptly.</p>

<p>Honora considered the matter a
little while. "Our Lord loved them,
even those who crucified him. I
could love them. Besides, I do not
believe that the Jews of to-day would
practise violence any more than
Christians would. We are friendly
with Unitarians, yet they are not
very different from some Jews. I
think we should love everybody but
the eternally lost. I could more
easily become attached to an upright
and conscientious Jew, than to a Catholic
who did not practise his religion."</p>

<p>Mr. Schöninger, as soon as he had
left the ladies, mended his pace, and
strode off rapidly down the hill. In
a few minutes he had reached a
lighted railroad station, where people
were going to and fro.</p>

<p>"Just in time!" he muttered, and
ran to catch a train that was beginning
to slip over the track. Grasping
the hand-rail, he drew himself
on to the step of the last car,
then walked through the other cars,
and, finally, took his seat in that
next the engine. Once a week he
gave lessons in a town fifteen miles
from Crichton, and he usually
found it more agreeable to take the
night train down than to go in the
morning.</p>

<p>In selecting this car he had hoped
to be alone; but he had hardly taken
his seat when he heard a step following
him, and another man appeared
and went into the seat in front of
him&mdash;an insignificant-looking person,
with a mean face. He turned about,
put his feet on the seat, stretched
his arm along the back, and, assuming
an insinuating smile, bade Mr.
Schöninger good evening. He had,
apparently, settled himself for a long
conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. Schöninger's habits were those
of a scrupulous gentleman, and he
had, even among gentlemen, the
charming distinction of always keeping
his feet on the floor. This man's
manners were, therefore, in more
than one way offensive, and his salutation
received no more encouraging
reply than a stare, and a scarcely
perceptible inclination of the head.</p>

<p>Mr. Schöninger seemed, indeed, to
regret even this slight concession,
for he rose immediately with an
air of decision, and walked forward
to the first seat. The door
of the car was open there as they
rushed on through the darkness, and,
looking forward, it was like beholding
the half-veiled entrance of a cavern
of fire. A cloud of illuminated
smoke and steam swept about and
enveloped the engine with a bright
atmosphere impenetrable to the sight,
and through this loomed the gigantic
shadow of a man. This shadow
sometimes disappeared for a moment
only to appear again, and seemed to
make threatening gestures, and to
catch and press down into the flames
some unseen adversary. Mr. Schöninger's
fancy was wide awake, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
his eyes were half asleep, and this
strange object became to him an object
of terror. Painful and anxious
thoughts, which he had resolutely
put away, left yet a dim and mysterious
background, on which this grotesque
figure, gigantic and wrapped
in fire, was thrown in strong relief.
He imagined it an impending doom,
which might at any moment fall
upon him.</p>

<p>Finding these fancies intolerable at
length, he shook himself wide awake,
rose, and walked unsteadily up and
down the car. In doing so, he perceived
that his fellow-passenger had
retreated to the last seat, and was,
apparently, sleeping, his cap drawn
low over his forehead. But Mr.
Schöninger's glance detected a slight
change in the position of the head as
he commenced his promenade, and
he could not divest himself of the belief
that, from under the low hat-brim,
a glance as sharp as his own
was following his every movement.</p>

<p>In an ordinary and healthy mood
of mind he would have cared little
for such espionage; but he was not
in such a mood. Circumstances had
of late tried his nerves, and it required
all his power of self-control to maintain
a composed exterior. Did this man
suspect his trouble, and search for,
or, perhaps, divine, or, possibly, know
the cause of it? He would gladly
have caught the fellow in his arms,
and thrown him headlong into the
outer darkness.</p>

<p>He returned to his place, and,
leaning close to the window, looked
out into the night. If he had hoped
to quiet himself by the sight of a
familiar nature, he was disappointed,
for the scene had a weird, though
occasionally beautiful aspect, very
unlike reality. The moon had set,
leaving that darkness which follows
a bright moonlight, or precedes the
dawn of day, when the stars seem to
be confounded by the near yet invisible
radiance of their conqueror,
and dare not shine with their own
full lustre. Only this locomotive,
dashing through the heart of the
night, rendered visible a flying panorama.
Groves of trees twirled round,
surprised in some mystic dance;
streams flashed out in all their windings,
red and serpent-like, and hid
themselves as suddenly; wide plains
swam past, all a blur, with hills
and mountains stumbling against the
horizon. Only one spot had even
a hint of familiarity. Framed round
by a great semi-circle of woods, not
many rods from the track, was a
long, narrow pond, with a few acres
of smooth green beyond it, and a
white cottage close to its farthest
shore. This little scene was as perfectly
secluded, apparently, as if it
had been in the midst of a continent
otherwise uninhabited. No road
nor neighboring house was visible
from the railroad. The dwellers in
that cottage seemed to be solitary
and remote, knowing nothing of the
wide, busy world save what they saw
from their vine-draped windows
when the long, noisy train, crowded
with strangers, hurried past them,
never stopping. What web that
clattering shuttle wove they might
wonder, but could not know, could
scarcely care as they dreamed their
lives away, lotos-eating. For the
lotos was not wanting.</p>

<p>Mr. Schöninger recollected his
first glimpse of that place as he had
whirled past one summer morning,
and swiftly now he caught the scene
between his eyelids, and closed them
on it, and dreamed over it. He
saw the varied green of the forest,
and the velvet green of the
banks, and the blue and brooding
sky. Like a sylvan nymph the cottage
stood in its draping vines, and
tried to catch glimpses of itself in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
glassy waters at its feet, half smothered
in drifting fragrant snow of
water-lilies.</p>

<p>What sort of being should come
forth from that dwelling of peace?
Mr. Schöninger asked himself. Who
should stretch out hands to him,
and draw him out of his troubled
life, approaching now a climax he
shrank from? His heart rose and
beat quickly. The door under the
vines swung slowly back, and a
woman floated out over the green,
as silent and as gracious as a cloud
over the blue above. The drapery
fluttered back from her advancing
foot till it reached the first shining
ripple of the pond, and then she
paused&mdash;a presence so warm and
living that it quickened his breathing.
She stretched her strong white
arms out toward him over the lilies
she would not cross, and the face
was Honora Pembroke's. The large,
calm look, the earnest glow that
saved from coldness, the full humanity
steeped through and shone
through by spiritual loveliness&mdash;they
were all hers.</p>

<p>He started, and opened his eyes.
Their pace was slackening, the great
black figure in its fiery atmosphere
was in some spasm of motion, and
walls of brick and stone were shutting
them in.</p>

<p>The cars stopped at the foot of an
immense flight of stairs that stretched
upward indefinitely, a dingy Jacob's
ladder, without the angels. Mr. Schöninger
slowly ascended them, heavyhearted
again, and therefore heavy-footed;
and, not far behind, a man
with a skulking step and a mean face
followed after. There was nothing
very mysterious in this walk. It led
merely through a deserted business
street, by the shortest route, to a
respectable hotel. Mr. Schöninger
called for a room, and went to it
immediately; the little man lingered
in the office, and hung about the
desk.</p>

<p>"That gentleman comes down
here pretty often in the night, doesn't
he?" he asked of the clerk.</p>

<p>The man nodded, without looking
up.</p>

<p>"Does he always record his name
when he comes?" pursued the questioner.</p>

<p>"Can't say," was the short answer,
still without looking up.</p>

<p>"Comes down every Wednesday
night, I suppose?" remarked the
stranger.</p>

<p>The clerk suddenly thrust his face
past the corner of the desk behind
which his catechiser stood.
"Look here, sir, what name shall I
put down for you?" he asked sharply.</p>

<p>The man drew back a little, and
turned away. "I'm not sure of booking
myself here," he replied.</p>

<p>The clerk came down promptly
from his perch. "Then it's time to
lock up," he said.</p>

<p>And when he had locked the door,
and pulled down the curtains, with a
snap that threatened to break their
fastenings, he put his hands in his
pockets, and made a short and emphatic
address to an imaginary audience.</p>

<p>"I don't believe there is any redemption
for spies," he said; "and I
would rather have a thief in my
house than a sneak. You sometimes
hear of a criminal who repents; but
nobody ever yet heard of one of your
prying, peeping, tattling sort reforming."</p>

<p>There being no other person present,
no one contradicted him, a circumstance
which seemed to increase
the strength of his convictions. He
paced the room two or three times,
then returned to his first stand, removing
his hands from his pockets
to clasp them behind his back, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
being a more dignified attitude for a
speaker.</p>

<p>"If I had my will," he pursued,
"every nose that poked itself into
other people's affairs would be cut
off."</p>

<p>Bravo! Mr. Clerk. You have
sense. But if you had also that sanguinary
wish of yours, what a number
of mutilated visages would be going
about the world! How many feminine
faces would be shorn of their
<em>retroussé</em>, or long, rooting feature, or
clawing, parrot beak, and how many
men would be incapacitated for taking
snuff!</p>

<p>Having delivered himself of his
rather extreme opinion, this excellent
man shut up the house and retired.</p>

<p>Mr. Schöninger looked forward
with interest to his promised visit to
Miss Pembroke's school, and was so
anxious that she should not by any
forgetfulness or change of plan deprive
him of it, that he reminded her
as they came out of the hall, after
their concert, of the permission she
had given him for the next afternoon.</p>

<p>"Certainly!" she replied smiling.
"But how can you think of such a
trifle after the grand success of this
evening?"</p>

<p>For their concert had been a perfect
success, and Mr. Schöninger
himself had been applauded with
such enthusiasm as had pleased even
him. It was the first time he had
played in public in Crichton, and,
respectable as he held their musical
taste to be, he had not been
prepared to see so ready an appreciation
of the higher order of instrumental
music.</p>

<p>"I never saw a more appreciative
audience," he said. "They applauded
at the right places, and it was a
well-bred applause. How delicate
was that little whisper of a clapping
during the prelude! It was like the
faint rustling of leaves in a summer
wind, and so soft that not a note was
lost. I have never seen so nearly
perfect an audience in any other city
in this country."</p>

<p>"Do not we always tell you that
Crichton is the most charming city
in the world?" laughed Annette Ferrier,
who had caught his last remark.</p>

<p>She was passing him, accompanied
by Lawrence Gerald. Her face
was bright with excitement, and the
glistening of her ornaments and her
gauzy robe through the black lace
mantle that covered her from head
to foot gave her the look of a butterfly
caught in a web. She had sung
brilliantly, dividing the honors of the
evening with Mr. Schöninger, and
Lawrence, finding her admired by
others, was gallant to her himself.
On the whole, she was radiant with
delight.</p>

<p>"Do not expect too much of my
little ones," Miss Pembroke said, recurring
to the proposed visit. "Recollect,
they are all poor, and they
have had but little instruction."</p>

<p>Mr. Schöninger did not tell her
that his interest was in her more than
in the children, and that he desired
to see how she would conduct herself
in such circumstances rather than
take any note of the persons and
acquirements of her pupils. To his
mind it was very strange that a
lady of her refinement should wish
to assume such a work without necessity.
His conception of the character
of teachers of children was
not flattering; he thought a certain
vulgarity inseparable from such persons,
a positiveness of speech, an oracular
tone of voice, and an authoritative
air, which the employment
conferred on successful teachers,
if it did not find them already
possessed of. It amused him to
fancy these fifty children swarming
about Miss Pembroke, like ants
about a lily, and it annoyed him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
think that she might receive some
stain from them.</p>

<p>"I like ladies to be charitable,"
he said to himself, as he went homeward;
"but there are kinds of rough
work I would prefer they should
delegate to others."</p>

<p>He was thinking of the physical
part of the work; Honora of the
spiritual.</p>

<p>The school-room was the lower
floor of a house at the corner of two
streets, and had been used as a shop,
the two wide show-windows at either
side of the door giving a full light.
The upper floors were occupied as
a dwelling-house. These windows
looked out on a wide and respectable
street; but the cross street, beginning
fairly enough, deteriorated as it
went on toward the Saranac, through
the poorest section of the city, and
ended in shanties and a dingy wharf
where lobsters were perpetually being
boiled in large kettles in dingy
boats, and crowds of ragged children
seemed to be always hanging
about, sucking lobster-claws, or
on the watch for them. Miss Pembroke's
charge were from this class
of children, and one of her great
difficulties was to keep her school-room
from having the fixed odor
of a fish-market.</p>

<p>The room was severely clean and
spotless, and, but that the side-walls
were nearly covered with maps,
bookcases, and blackboards, would
have been glaring white; for the
walls and ceiling were white-washed,
the wood-work painted white, and
the floor scoured white. Two rows
of oak-colored benches extended
across the room, the backs toward
the windows. The sun shone in unobstructed
all the afternoon. Only
when it began to touch the last row
of benches were the green worsted
curtains drawn down far enough to
keep it within bounds. Miss Pembroke's
chair, table, and piano were
in the space opposite the door. On
the centre of the wall behind her
hung a large crucifix, and on a
bracket beneath it a marble Child
Jesus stretched out his arms to the
little ones. On larger brackets to
right and left stood an Immaculate
Lady and a S. Joseph. They
were thus in the midst of the Holy
Family.</p>

<p>These images were constantly surrounded
by wreaths, arches, and
flowers, so that the end of the room
had quite the appearance of a bower;
and on all his festivals, and whenever
prayers were said, a candle was
lighted before the Infant Jesus, who
was the patron of their school, and
the dearest object of their childish
devotion. It was delightful to them
to know that they need not always
approach their God in the language,
to them, often inexplicable, of the
mature and the learned, but that
they could whisper their ingenuous
petitions and praises into the indulgent
ear of a holy Child, using their
own language, and asking him to
be their interpreter. S. Joseph with
the lily and the white Lady with
her folded hands they worshipped
with awe; but they were not afraid
of the dear Infant who stretched out
his arms to them.</p>

<p>Fifty little faces, all brown, but
otherwise various, looked straight at
their teacher&mdash;blue eyes and brown
eyes, black eyes and grey, large eyes
and small eyes, bright and dull eyes;
and fifty young souls were at that
instant occupied with one thought.
The first faint thrilling of the silence
with martial music was heard, and
they were eager to take their places
to see the advancing procession.
But Miss Pembroke waited still.
She had told Mr. Schöninger to come
at three o'clock, and it lacked five
minutes of that. Just as she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
thinking that she would give him two
minutes' grace, he appeared.</p>

<p>She went at once to place the
children, and he watched with a
smile of pleasure and amusement the
soldierly precision of the performance.
The door was opened wide,
and two of the largest boys carried
out and placed a bench near the
edge of the upper step. At the motion
of a finger, the smallest boys
filed out and seated themselves on
this bench, and an equal number of
larger ones stood behind keeping
guard. Then the door was closed.
At the next silent gesture the smallest
of the boys and girls remaining
seated themselves in the low, broad
ledge of the windows, the next size
placed a bench across each window
recess for themselves, and the largest
again stood behind the benches.
Not a word had been spoken, not a
child had turned its head, not the
slightest noise nor confusion had occurred,
and all were perfectly well
placed to see.</p>

<p>"What admirable order!" the gentleman
exclaimed. "You must have
drilled them thoroughly."</p>

<p>"It did not seem to me wasting
time," Miss Pembroke replied. "I
wish to impress on them the necessity
of a decorous and reserved manner
in public. They are too prone
to presume, and be more than ordinarily
lawless on such occasions.
Besides, it teaches them self-control."</p>

<p>The two sat back at a little distance.
The children began to stretch
their heads forward, and whisper exclamations
to each other. The air
resounded with martial sounds, and
a solid front of superb grey horses
appeared, well-caparisoned and well-ridden,
the full crimped manes tossed
over their arching necks. Behind
them another and another line pressed,
making a living wall.</p>

<p>"I think one feels the influence
of such a mass of strong life and
courage," Miss Pembroke remarked.
"It seems to me it would invigorate
a weak person to be near those
horses."</p>

<p>Mr. Schöninger had been thinking
nearly the same thing. "I have
fancied it not unlikely," he said,
"that in a bold cavalry charge the
horses may help to inspire the riders.
The neighborhood of strong animal
life is, no doubt, invigorating.
It would be fine to stand face to
face with a herd of wild cattle, if
they could be surely stopped in mid-career,
to feel the air stirring with
their breaths, and see their eyes
glaring through heaps of rough mane.
There would be something electrical
in it, as there is in a crowd
of men; and in both cases it is a
merely physical excitement."</p>

<p>"But a crowd of men may be
electrified by some great thought,"
suggested Honora.</p>

<p>"Not unless each had the thought
in his single mind before, either latent
or conscious. I do not believe
that any crowd or excitement, however
immense, can put a great
thought into a little soul. I can
never act with an excited crowd, can
hardly look at one with respect."
His lip expressed contempt. "It
is true that an eloquent leader may
have the power of inciting people to
some good deed; but even so, they
are only a machine which he works.
Great thoughts are not vociferous.
They float in air, with no sound, unless
it is the sound of wings."</p>

<p>Honora checked the words that
rose to her lips so suddenly that a
deep blush bathed her face. She
had been thinking of the crowd that
roared "Crucify him!" and had recollected
only just in time that they
were this man's remote ancestors.
But she recollected also that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
to him as original sin was to her, an
hereditary, but not a personal, stain,
and that baptism could wash both
away. Her charity began at home,
in the great Christian family, but it
stayed not there: it overflowed to all
living creatures.</p>

<p>"I have almost an enthusiasm for
firemen," she said hastily. "They
sometimes perform such wonders,
and run such terrible risks for scarcely
a reward. Unlike soldiers, they
save without destroying anything.
How beautiful their engines are!"</p>

<p>The procession was a long and
very brilliant one, and the companies
had vied with each other in
decoration. The engines shone as if
made of burnished gold and silver,
and wreaths and bouquets of green
and flowers decked them.</p>

<p>"These processions, more than
any others I have seen, remind me of
descriptions of pageants in the old
time," remarked Honora, when they
had been silent a while. "There is so
much show and glitter in them, and
the costumes are so gay. How I
would like to be transported back to
that time for one year!"</p>

<p>Her thoughts had taken a flight between
the first and last words, and
she was thinking of mediæval religion,
with its untroubled faith and its
fiery zeal.</p>

<p>Mr. Schöninger did not share her
enthusiasm. Those had been bitter
days for his people, and perhaps he
was thinking so.</p>

<p>"I imagine you would ask to be
transported back again before the
year was over," he said quietly.
"Those times look very picturesque
at this distance, with their Rembrandt
shading. But there was no
more heroism then than there is to-day.
I far prefer the hero of to-day.
He is a better bred man, not so blatant
as the mediæval. It seems to
me that the admirers of that time
are chiefly the poets, who sacrifice
everything to the picturesque; ambitious
men, who covet power; and&mdash;pardon
me!&mdash;devout ladies who
have been captivated by legends of
the saints, and stories of ecclesiastical
pageantry, but who take little
thought for humanity at large."</p>

<p>"But in those days," said Miss
Pembroke, "men had some respect
for authority and law, and now they
despise it."</p>

<p>"It is the fault of authority if it
is despised," Mr. Schöninger replied
with decision. "License is the inevitable
reaction from tyranny, and
is in proportion to it. So long
as man retains any vestige of the
image of the Creator, tyranny will
always, in time, produce rebels. The
world is now inebriated with freedom;
let those whose abuse of authority
created this burning thirst
share the opprobrium of its excesses.
Some day the equilibrium will be
found. We cannot force it; it is a
question of growth; but we can help.
You are helping it," he added, smiling.</p>

<p>"What you have said sounds just,"
she replied, thoughtfully; "and I like
justice. Perhaps the abuse of legitimate
authority is a greater sin than
rebellion against it, since the ruler
should be wiser and better than the
ruled."</p>

<p>They were again silent awhile,
the gentleman hesitating whether to
speak his thought, and finally speaking.</p>

<p>"Trust one who has studied the
world well," he said earnestly. "Instead
of being determined not to believe,
mankind at this time is longing
to believe. But it is determined not
to be duped. The sceptic of to-day
was made by the hypocrite of yesterday,
and half the scepticism is affected,
as half the piety was affected.
Men are ashamed and afraid to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
caught in a trap, and they pretend to
disbelieve, when in fact they only
doubt. You must now prove to
them that truth itself is true, since
they have so often been deceived by
falsehood in the garb of truth. Let
a man or a measure prove to be sincere
and honest, and there was never
a period in the history of the world
when either would win more hearty
approval than now. It is true that
the childlike trustfulness of mankind
is gone, partly from growth, partly
because it has been abused; but the
nobler powers are maturing. To believe
this, you need not give up your
faith. I have seen the eyes of one
of the most bitter of scoffers fill with
tears, and his lips tremble, at a
proof of ardent and pious devotion
which was not meant to be known.
That man was a scoffer because his
common sense and sentiment of justice
had been insulted by pious pretenders.
If he could believe, he
would be a saint."</p>

<p>Honora Pembroke's face was troubled.
There could be no doubt
that the man was honest and sincere
in what he said, and that much of
what he said was true. But was a
Jew to teach a Christian? She
could not be sure that his judgment
was unbiased, and that one more
learned than she would not be able
to refute him. She said the best
thing she could think of.</p>

<p>"False professors do not make
false doctrines. And if the human
mind is becoming so adult and strong,
it should judge the truth by itself,
not by the person who professes
it."</p>

<p>"You are quite right," Mr. Schöninger
answered. "And that is precisely
what people are learning to do.
It is also what many, who wish truth
to be believed on their own testimony,
object to their doing. I repeat"&mdash;he
glanced with anxiety into her
clouded face&mdash;"I earnestly assure you
that I have not uttered a word which
conflicts with your creed, though it is
not mine. If I were to-day to become
a Catholic, I should only reiterate
what I have said on this subject."</p>

<p>The cloud passed from her face,
but still she did not speak. She was
not gifted in argument, and this subject
was complex, and, moreover, a
bone of contention.</p>

<p>"It has occurred to me," he said
presently, "that the people in Crichton,
though they appear to be very
liberal, may still have a prejudice
against me as a Jew. That would be
of no consequence to me in the case
of most of them; but there are a few
whom I should be sorry to know had
such a feeling. The Jews are much
misunderstood and slandered, though
people have an opportunity of learning
their true character if they would.
The majority seem to look on every
Jew as a probable or possible usurer
and dealer in old clothes, and a person
capable of joining a rabble at any
moment, and pursuing an innocent
man to death. I do not, of course,
fancy for an instant that you have
any sympathy with such people; but
I think it possible that you may misunderstand
my attitude toward your
church. I have not the slightest feeling
of enmity against it as long as it
does not do violence to me or mine,
and while its members are true to the
doctrines of peace and charity which
they profess. As an artist I admire
it. Its theology is the only one which
still retains binding and implacable
obligations of form, consequently,
the only one that can inspire high
art. I do not count the old Jews,
who are rapidly melting away. I
am of the reformed Jews."</p>

<p>"You no longer expect the coming
of the Redeemer, nor the return
to Jerusalem, nor the triumph of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
people?" she asked, looking at him
in astonishment.</p>

<p>"We no longer believe in them,"
he replied.</p>

<p>"What, then, is left you?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>He smiled slightly. "I expect and
long for the redemption of mankind
by the spirit of God, and I believe
that truth and charity will prevail,
though they may not descend from
heaven to become incarnate in one
form. The Jerusalem my people
will return to is the spiritual city of
the children of God. Is it not nobler
than the pretty myths which have
been wasting our energies and dividing
the brotherhood of men into
petty clans, all hating each other
even while they professed that love
was their prime virtue?"</p>

<p>"But sacrifice," she said, "what
did you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"We had truth and error mingled.
The sacrifice was merely a remnant
of heathen customs. Peoples who
knew nothing of Judaism nor of
Christianity had their offerings and
sacrifices. The Jews were the chosen
people, finer and more spiritual
than any other; and to the souls of
the chosen among them the Creator
revealed his truths. They renounced
all heathenish doctrines, and into the
few ceremonies and customs they retained
they infused a spiritual significance.
As the race deteriorated, this
spiritual meaning was misinterpreted,
and became more and more literal
and gross. The people fell into sin,
and for this the Creator punished
them by taking away their power and
pre-eminence, and by scattering them
over the face of the earth."</p>

<p>Honora listened intently; and when
he had finished, she uttered but one
word. Clasping her hands and lifting
her eyes, her heart seemed to
burst upward like a fountain, tossing
that one word into air, "Emmanuel!"</p>

<p>Not the primeval Creator alone,
distant and awful, but God with us!
Into this vast and terrible void which
had been spread out before her, she
invoked with passion the incarnate,
the lowly, the pitiful, the suffering
God.</p>

<p>"We hold that sacrifice is a practice
of divine institution retained
from our first parents, not an originally
heathen custom," she added after
a moment, regaining her composure.
"You are, however, obliged to give
up your belief in it, or be inconsistent.
I can see now that if you hold to
the sacrifice, you must hold to the
Redeemer; if to the Redeemer, then
you must believe in Christ, since the
time is gone by for expectation; and
if you accept the Christ, you must
be a Roman Catholic."</p>

<p>"Precisely!" said the Jew. He
had felt a momentary electric shock
at the passion of her first exclamation,
and had seen with emotion the
flush and fire in her countenance.
Now he smiled at her concise statement
of the case.</p>

<p>Miss Pembroke rose, for the last
of the procession was passing. The
children were called back to their
seats in the same order in which they
had left them, and a few simple exercises
were gone through with at
the request of their visitor. All was
well calculated to unfold and inform
their young minds, but nothing was
for show.</p>

<p>Mr. Schöninger blushed for the
mistake he had made in fancying
that any occupation on earth could
be more refined and noble than Miss
Pembroke's, when it was conducted
in Miss Pembroke's manner. It
seemed an occupation for angels.
She possessed, evidently, in a preeminent
degree, the power to understand
and interest children, and she
used that power to perfect ends.
There was none of that personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
familiarity which he had dreaded to
see, that promiscuous fondness and
caressing by which some women
fancy they please children, when, in
fact, the finer sort of children are
oftener than not displeased with it.
A kind touch of her fingers was to
them an immense favor, and a kiss
would have been remembered for
ever. But while they treated her with
profound respect, they approached
her with perfect confidence and delight.
They gathered about her,
and gazed into her sympathetic face,
bright and transparent with love from
a bountiful woman's heart. They
looked at her as a sky full of little
stars may look into a smooth lake,
and each saw its own reflection there,
and was happy. In her soul all innocent
infantile thoughts and fancies
were condensed, as cloud and spray
are condensed into water, and not
only could she remember the process,
but she could reverse it at will,
could evaporate a thought or truth
too strong for childish intellects, and
give it in the form of rosy clouds to
wide, grasping, childish imaginations.</p>

<p>Only one exercise failed at first.
The children were shy of singing before
the stranger. All their voices
faltered into silence but one, a rather
fair voice of a little boy who was
perfectly self-confident, and who evidently
expected applause.</p>

<p>Mr. Schöninger took no notice of
the child. Its vanity and boldness
displeased him. "A shallow thing!"
he thought; and said, "I see that I
must hire you to sing for me. You
like fairy-stories, surely. Well, sing
me but one song, and I will tell you
the story."</p>

<p>His voice and smile reassured them.
Moreover, a gentleman, no matter
how splendid he might be, who could
tell fairy-stories, could not be very
dreadful. They exchanged smiles
and glances, took courage, fixed
their eyes on their teacher, and sang
a pretty hymn in good time and tune,
and with good expression.</p>

<p>In their first essay the musician
had caught a faltering little silvery
note, which had failed as soon as
heard. In the second it came out
round and clear, a voice of surprising
beauty. He marked the singer,
and called him forward as soon as
the hymn was over. The boy came
awkwardly and blushing. He was
the ugliest and most dingy pupil
there. Only a pair of melancholy,
dark, and lustrous eyes, habitually
downcast, and a set of perfect teeth,
redeemed the face from being disagreeable.
Through those eyes looked
a winged soul that did not recognize
itself, still less expect recognition
from others, but felt only the vague
weight and sadness of an uncongenial
life. He gave the impression of
a beautiful bird whose every plume
is so laden with mire it cannot fly.</p>

<p>"You have a good voice, and
should learn how to sing," Mr. Schöninger
said to him kindly. "I will
teach you, if Miss Pembroke approves,
and will make the arrangements.
Of course it will cost you
nothing."</p>

<p>"He needs encouragement," the
musician remarked when the boy had
returned to his seat; "and he needs
to have his position defined before
the others. Do you not perceive that
they despise him? He has the voice
of an angel, and he looks remarkable.
And now for my story."</p>

<p>The children's eyes sparkled with
anticipation, and the teacher leaned
smilingly to listen. Let us listen
also, and become better acquainted
with Mr. Schöninger.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time, there was a
great wrangle in a certain street," the
story-teller began. "Five little boys
and girls were quarreling, and two
dogs were barking. The neighbors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
put their heads out their windows,
and the policeman stopped. Mrs.
Blake put her two forefingers in her
two ears, for the noise was near her
step, and the five boys and girls were
all telling her together what the matter
was, and whose fault it was.
Then the mothers called their children
home, and two went into Mrs.
Blake's, for they were hers. This was
the story she drew from them: Anne
Blake had said a cross word to one
of the others, that other had made a
face at the next, the third had slapped
the fourth, and it went round the circle.
So it seemed that Anne started
the whole by speaking a cross
word.</p>

<p>"'Since you are sorry, I will talk
no more to you about it,' her mother
said. 'But I wish you to go up to
your chamber and sit alone a little
while, and think over a Chinese proverb
which is written on this slip of
paper. You are ten years old, and
must begin to think.'</p>

<p>"Anne went slowly up-stairs to her
chamber, shut the door after her, and
sat down in a little cushioned chair
by the window to read her proverb.
Its being Chinese did not prevent
it from being good. This is what
she read: 'A word once spoken, a
coach and six cannot bring it back
again.'</p>

<p>"The day was warm, and the curtain
at the window swung with a lulling
motion, giving glimpses of blue
sky with white clouds sailing over,
and, below, of the top of a grape-vine
full of leaves and small green grapes.</p>

<p>"Anne gazed at the sky till it made
her feel sleepy&mdash;gazing at bright
things does make one sleepy&mdash;then
she gazed at the grape-vine. Presently,
she saw something in this vine
that looked like a tiny ladder, hidden
among the leaves. It looked so much
like a ladder that she leaned forward
and pulled the curtain aside, to see
more plainly. Sure enough! It was
the loveliest ladder, or stairway, winding
down and down. Its steps were
dark, like vine branches, and there
was a railing at each side of twigs and
tendrils, and it wound down and
down, in sight and out of sight.
And, more wonderful still, it was no
longer a yard, with the city about,
she saw, but a great vine covering all
the window, and glimpses of a moonlighted
forest down below.</p>

<p>"'I must go down,' says Anne;
and so down she went on the beautiful
stairs.</p>

<p>"Lights and shades fluttered over
her, and the leaves clapped together,
and little tendrils caught at her dress
in play. And by-and-by she stepped
on to the brightest greensward that
could be, full of blue and white violets.
The trees arched over her, the
air was sweet, and there was a smooth
pond near by. The water was so
very smooth that she would never
have known it was water if the banks
had not turned the wrong way in
it, and the trees grown down instead
of up. A little white boat, too,
had another little white boat under
it, the two keel to keel. Swans ran
down the shore as she looked, and
splashed into the water, dipping their
heads under, and making the whole
surface so full of motion that the upside-down
trees and banks and boat
disappeared. Words cannot describe
how beautiful the place was. There
was every kind of flower, and hosts
of birds, and the moonlight was so
bright that all could be distinctly
seen. There were also a great many
splendid moths that looked like flowers
flying about, and flapping their
petals.</p>

<p>"But the most beautiful part was
that everything seemed to breathe of
peace and love. The birds sang
and cooed to each other, the blossoms
leaned cheek to cheek, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
water laughed at the stones it ran
over, and the wet stones smiled
back, the gray old rocks held tenderly
the flowers and mosses that grew
in their hollows, and the mosses and
flowers held on to the rocks with
their tiny roots, like little children
clinging to old people who are fond
of them.</p>

<p>"'How beautiful it is to see them
so loving,' Anne said. 'They are a
sort of people, too; for they look
alive. I wish other folks would be
as good. I'm sure I try; but then
somebody always comes along and
says something ugly; and then, of
course, I can't help being ugly back
again.'</p>

<p>"'Oh! yes, you can,' said a sweet
voice close by.</p>

<p>"Anne looked and saw a charming
little lady standing beside her.
She was so beautiful that words cannot
describe her, and she carried a
pink petunia for a parasol to preserve
her complexion. For she was
exquisitely fair, and the moonlight
was really very bright.</p>

<p>"'Oh! yes, you can,' she repeated
when Anne looked at her. 'You
can give a pleasant answer, and then
people will stop being ugly.'</p>

<p>"'I could do it if everybody else
would,' Anne said. 'The beginning
is the trouble. How nice it
would be if there were a king over
all the world, and he would say,
Now, after I have counted three, all
of you stop being cross, and begin to
love each other, and keep on loving
a whole hour. If you don't, I'll cut
your heads off!'</p>

<p>"'That would not be love; it
would be a make-believe to save
their heads,' the little lady answered.
'But there is such a king, and he
has commanded us to love each
other, and....'</p>

<p>"Here she was interrupted by a
loud flapping of wings and a terrible
croaking, and a great black bird,
something like a bat, flew by; and
wherever it struck its wings other
bats flew out, and the air grew dark
with them, and all the beautiful forest
was changed. The stones tried
to stop the brook, and the brook
tried to upset the stones; the leaves
struck each other, the swans and little
birds began to pull each other's
feathers out. All was discord.</p>

<p>"And then there was a rolling of
wheels, and a trampling of hoofs,
and a great yellow coach appeared
drawn by six horses covered with
foam. The coachman looked as if
he were driving for his life, and there
was a head thrust from each window
of the coach, telling him to drive
faster. All the heads wore caps like
dish-covers, and had long braids of
hair hanging down their necks,
though they were men; and their
eyes slanted down toward their noses,
instead of going straight across their
faces.</p>

<p>"'We are trying to catch a wicked
word that is ruining all the place,'
they said, 'but we cannot. A wicked
word has wings.'</p>

<p>"'So has a kind word wings,'
said the little lady. 'Send a kind
word after the cross one, and perhaps
it may bring it back.'</p>

<p>"'You are right, madam,' said
one of the Chinamen; and he nodded
his head till the long braid at the
back of it wagged to and fro. And
he kept on nodding so queerly that
Anne felt obliged to nod too, and so
he nodded, and she nodded, till he
nodded his head off. And then she
nodded her head off&mdash;no, not quite
off; but she nodded so that she
waked herself up. For she had been
dreaming.</p>

<p>"Then she jumped up and ran
down-stairs and out doors as fast as
her feet would carry her. And in
ten minutes she was back again, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
out of breath, and full of excitement.
'Mother,' she said, 'a coach
and six can't do it, but a kind word
can. I told Jane I was sorry, and
she told&mdash;and we all told each other
that we were sorry, and then we
were glad.' The words were rather
mixed up, but the meaning was all
right."</p>

<p>"I am truly grateful to you for
allowing me to come this afternoon,"
Mr. Schöninger said on taking leave.
"My visit has been to me like a drop
of cold water to one in a fever, or
like the sound of David's harp to
Saul. I am refreshed."</p>

<p>He looked both sad and pleased.
"I was about to thank you for coming,"
Honora answered. "You have
given me and the children much
pleasure."</p>

<p>And so, with a friendly salutation,
they separated.</p>

<p>She mused a moment. "If he
could believe in the sacrifice, all
would follow," she thought.</p>

<p>Then she called the children to
their prayers, but first said a word to
them.</p>

<p>"There is something, my dear
children, that I want very much,"
she said. "Oh! I long for it. I
shall be unhappy if I do not have it.
And I want all of you to ask the
Infant Jesus to give it to me for his
dear mother's sake. Ask with all
your hearts. I will tell him what
I wish for."</p>

<p>Her wish was that Mr. Schöninger
might believe that sacrifice was a
divine revelation, not a heathenish
custom.</p>

<p>"That is all he needs from me,"
she thought. "I trust him. If he
has that to begin with, he will himself
ask God for the rest."</p>

<h3>ITALIAN CONFISCATION LAWS.</h3>


<p class="center">REVIEWED FROM AN AMERICAN STAND-POINT.</p>

<p class="center">BY A LAWYER.
</p>

<p>"No state shall pass any <i lang="la">ex post facto</i>
law, or law impairing the obligation
of contracts."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>This is indeed a moral law, and
has been recognized as such by all
civilized nations.</p>

<p>Justice Curtis, in his <cite>Life of Webster</cite>
(vol. i., chap. 7, p. 165) thus
notices the decision in the Supreme
Court which first gave the scope and
meaning of this clause in regard to
charters of private corporations:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The framers of the Constitution of the
United States, moved chiefly by the mischiefs
created by the preceding legislation
of the states, which had made serious
encroachments on the rights of property,
inserted a clause in that instrument which
declared that 'no state shall pass any <i lang="la">ex
post facto</i> law, or law impairing the obligation
of contracts.' The first branch of
this clause had always been understood
to relate to criminal legislation, the second
to legislation affecting civil rights.
But before the case of Dartmouth College
v. Woodward occurred, there had
been no judicial decisions respecting the
meaning and scope of the restraint in regard
to contracts, excepting that it had
more than once been determined by the
Supreme Court of the United States that
a grant of lands made by a state is a
contract within the protection of this provision,
and is, therefore, irrevocable.
The decisions, however, could go but
little way toward the solution of the
questions involved in the case of the college.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>They did, indeed, establish the
principle that contracts of the state itself
are beyond the reach of subsequent legislation
equally with contracts between individuals,
and that there are grants of a
state that are contracts. But this college
stood upon a charter granted by the
crown of England before the American
Revolution. Was the state of New
Hampshire&mdash;a sovereign in all respects
after the Revolution, and remaining one
after the federal constitution, excepting
in those respects in which it had subjected
its sovereignty to the restraints of that
instrument&mdash;bound by the contracts of the
English crown? Is the grant of a charter
of incorporation a contract between the
sovereign power and those on whom the
charter is bestowed? If an act of incorporation
is a contract, is it so in any case
but that of a private corporation? Was
this college, which was an institution of
learning, established for the promotion
of education, a private corporation, or
was it one of those instruments of government
which are at all times under the
control and subject to the direction of
the legislative power? All these questions
were involved in the inquiry,
whether the legislative power of the state
had been so restrained by the constitution
of the United States that it could
not alter the charter of this institution,
against the will of the trustees, without
impairing the obligation of a contract.
If this inquiry were to receive an affirmative
answer, the constitutional jurisprudence
of the United States would embrace
a principle of the utmost importance
to every similar institution of learning,
and to every incorporation then
existing, or thereafter to exist, not belonging
to the machinery of government as a
political instrument....</p>

<p>"On the conclusion of the argument
the Chief-Justice (Marshall) intimated that
a decision was not to be expected until
the next term. It was made in February,
1819, fully confirming the grounds on
which Mr. Webster had placed the cause.
From this decision, the principle in our
constitutional jurisprudence which regards
a charter of a private corporation as
a contract, and places it under the protection
of the Constitution of the United
States, takes its date."</p></div>

<p>We add a passage from Mr. Webster's
speech in this case, as quoted
by the same author from a letter of
Prof. Goodrich, of Yale College, to
Rufus Choate:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"This, sir, is my case. It is the case
not merely of that humble institution; it
is the case of every college in our land.
It is more. It is the case of every eleemosynary
institution throughout our
country&mdash;of all those great charities
founded by the piety of our ancestors to
alleviate human misery and scatter blessings
along the pathway of life. It is
more! It is, in some sense, the case of
every man among us who has property
of which he may be stripped, for the
question is simply this: Shall our state
legislatures be allowed to take that
which is not their own, to turn it from its
original use, and apply it to such ends
or purposes as they in their discretion
shall see fit?"</p></div>

<p>The charitable and religious institutions
of Italy and the States of the
Church were founded under guarantees
as strong at least as those which
assured the perpetuity of Dartmouth
College, and were entitled to
as much immunity from confiscation
and intrusion for all coming time.</p>

<p>When a law is in its nature a contract,
and absolute rights have vested
under that contract, a repeal of
the law cannot divest those rights,
nor annihilate or impair a title acquired
under the law. A grant is a
contract according to the meaning
given to the word by jurists. A
grant is a contract executed, and a
party is always estopped by his own
grant. A party cannot pronounce
his own act or deed invalid, whatever
cause may be assigned for its
invalidity, and though that party be
the legislature of a state. A grant
amounts to an extinguishment of the
right of the grantor, and implies a
contract not to reassert that right.
A grant from a state should be as
much protected as a grant from one
individual to another; therefore, a
state is as much inhibited from impairing
its own contracts, or a con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>tract
to which it is a party, as it is
from impairing the obligation of contracts
between two individuals. A
grant once made by the ruling or
competent power, creates an indefeasible
and irrevocable title. There
is no authority or principle which
could support the doctrine that such
a grant was revocable in its own nature,
and held only <i lang="la">durante bene
placito</i>. For no ruling power, be it
kingly, legislative, or otherwise, can
repeal a law or grant creating a corporate
body, or confirming to them
property already acquired under the
faith of previous laws or edicts, and
by such repeal vest the property in
others without the consent or default
of the corporators. Such a procedure
would be repugnant to the principles
of natural justice. A society
or order of religious people holding
property in common or <i lang="la">in solido</i>,
may be considered in the character
of a private eleemosynary institution
endowed with a capacity to take
property for objects unconnected
with government: it receives gifts
or devises, and other private donations
bestowed by individuals on the
faith of its perpetuity and usefulness&mdash;such
a corporation not being invested
with any political power whatever,
or partaking in any degree in
the administration of civil government.
It is merely an institution
or private corporation for general
charity. It is established under a
charter, which was a contract, to
which the donors, the trustees of the
corporation, and the governing power
were the original parties, and it
was granted for a valuable consideration&mdash;for
the security and disposition
of the property necessary for the existence
of the community, order, or
society.</p>

<p>The legal interest, in every such
literary and charitable institution, is
in trustees, and to be asserted by
them, which they claim or defend on
behalf of the society or community
for the object of religion, charity,
or education, for which they were
originally created, and the private
donations made. Contracts of this
kind, creating such charitable or educational
institutions, should be at all
times protected by the state, and
their rights maintained by the courts
administered by a pure and just judiciary.
Conquests or revolutions
cannot change the rights acquired
under such contracts, and no state
should by any act transfer the rights
of property theretofore acquired, nor
transfer from the trustees appointed
according to the will of the founders
or donors. The will of the state
should not be substituted for the will
of the donors, or convert an institution,
moulded according to the will
of its founders, and placed under the
control of people of their own selection,
into government property.
Such action is of course subversive
of the original compact on the faith
of which the donors invested their
gifts, donations, or devises, and is,
therefore, repugnant to every idea of
honesty and good morals, for enforcing
which governments are instituted.</p>

<p>A grant to a private trustee, for
the benefit of a particular <em>cestui que
trust</em>, or for any special, private, or
public charity, cannot be the less a
contract because the trustee takes nothing
for his own benefit. Nor does
a private donation vested in a trustee
for objects of a general nature thereby
become a public trust, which a
government may at its pleasure take
from the trustee. A government
cannot even revoke a grant of its
own funds, when given to a corporation
or private person for special
uses. It has no other remaining authority
but what is judicial to enforce
the proper administration of the
trust. Nor is such a grant less a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
contract though no beneficial interest
accrues to the possessor. All incorporeal
hereditaments, as immunities,
dignities, offices, and franchises,
are rights deemed valuable in law,
and whenever they are the subject of
contract or grant they should be held
as legal estates. They are held as
powers coupled with interests, and
consequently are vested rights, and
of which the possessors should not
be divested by any legislative body
without their consent.</p>

<p>Chief-Justice Marshall (in U. S.
<em>v.</em> Percheman, <cite>7 Peters 86</cite>) says:
It is unusual, even in cases of conquest,
for the conqueror to do more
than to displace the sovereign and
assume dominion over the country;
and that the modern usage of nations,
which has become law, would
be violated; that sense of justice and
right which is acknowledged and felt
by the whole civilized world, would
be outraged if private property should
be generally confiscated and private
rights annulled.</p>

<p>Justice Sprague (Amy Warwick,
<cite>2 Sprague 150</cite>) says: Confiscations
of property, not for any use that has
been made of it, which go not against
an offending thing, but are inflicted
for the personal delinquency of the
owner, are punitive, and punishment
should be inflicted only upon due
conviction of personal guilt.</p>

<p>The communities whose rights are
now invaded and whose property is
confiscated, ought to be protected
under the law of nations. For, by
this law is understood that code of
public instruction which defines the
rights and prescribes the duties of
nations in their intercourse with each
other. The faithful observance of
this law is essential to national character
and the happiness of mankind.
According to Montesquieu, it is
founded on the principle that different
nations ought to do each other
as much good in peace, and as little
harm in war, as possible. The most
useful and practical part of the law
of nations is instituted or positive
law, founded on usage, consent, and
agreement. It is impossible to separate
this law from natural jurisprudence,
or to consider that it does not
derive much of its force and dignity
from the same principle of right reason,
the same views of the nature and
constitution of man, and the same
sanction of divine revelation, as
those from which the science of morality
is deduced. There is a natural
and a positive law of nations. By
the former, every state in its relations
with other states is bound to
conduct itself with justice, good faith,
and benevolence; and this application
of the law of nature has been
called by Vattel the necessary law
of nations, because nations are bound
by the law of nature to observe it;
and it is termed by others the internal
law of nations, because it is obligatory
upon them in point of conscience.</p>

<p>That eminent jurist, Chancellor
Kent, says that the science of public
law should not be separated from
that of ethics, nor encourage the dangerous
suggestion that governments
are not strictly bound by the obligations
of truth, justice, and humanity
in relation to other powers, as they
are in the management of their own
local concerns. States or bodies politic
are to be considered as moral
persons, having a public will, capable
and free to do right and wrong, inasmuch
as they are collections of individuals,
each of whom carries with
him into the service of the community
the same binding law of morality
and religion which ought to
control his conduct in private life.</p>

<p>The law of nations consists of general
principles of right and justice,
equally suitable to the government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
of individuals in a state of natural
equality and to the relations and
conduct of nations; the conduct of
nations should be governed by principles
fairly to be deduced from the
rights and duties of nations and the
nature of moral obligation; and we
have the authority of lawyers of antiquity,
and of some of the first masters
in the modern school of public
law, for placing the moral obligations
of nations and of individuals on similar
grounds, and for considering individual
and national morality as
parts of one and the same science.</p>

<p>The law of nations, as far as it is
founded upon the principles of natural
law, is equally binding in every
age, and upon all mankind.</p>

<p>The law of nature, by the obligations
of which individuals and states
are bound, is identical with the will
of God, and that will is ascertained
by consulting divine revelation,
where that is declaratory, or by the
application of human reason where
revelation is silent. Christianity is an
authoritative publication of natural
religion, and it is from the sanction
which revelation gives to natural
law that we must expect respect to
be paid to justice between nations.
Christianity reveals to us a general
system of morality, but the application
to the details of practice is often
left to be discovered by human reason.</p>

<p>Justice is of perpetual obligation,
and is essential to the well-being of
every society. The great commonwealth
of nations stands in need of
law, and observance of faith, and the
practice of justice.</p>

<p>If the question was one to be decided
by the civil courts according to
the American rules concerning rights
to property held by ecclesiastical
bodies, the points involved might be
presented as follows:</p>

<p>1. Where the property which is
the subject of controversy is, by the
express terms of the deed or will of
the donor or other instrument under
which it is held, devoted to the
teaching, support, or spread of a
specific form of religious doctrine
and belief.</p>

<p>2. Where the property is held by
a religious congregation, which by
the nature of its organization is
strictly independent of other ecclesiastical
associations, and, so far as
church government is concerned,
owes no fealty or obligation to any
higher authority.</p>

<p>3. The third is where the religious
congregation or ecclesiastical body
holding the property is but a subordinate
member of some general
church organization in which there
are superior ecclesiastical tribunals
with a general and ultimate power
of control, more or less complete, in
some supreme judicatory over the
whole membership of that general
organization.</p>

<p>Respecting the first of these classes,
it does not admit of a rational doubt
that an individual or an association
of individuals may dedicate property
by way of trust to the purpose of
sustaining, supporting, and propagating
definite religious doctrines or
principles, provided that in doing so
they violate no law of morality, and
give to the instrument by which their
purpose is evidenced the formalities
which the law requires.</p>

<p>And it is then the duty of a court
of law, in a case properly brought
before it, to see that the property
so dedicated is not diverted from the
trust which is thus attached to its
use. So long as there are persons
qualified within the meaning of the
original dedication, and who are also
willing to teach the doctrines or principles
prescribed in the act of dedication,
and so long as there is any
one so interested in the execution of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
the trust as to have a standing in
court, it must be that they can prevent
the diversion of the property or
fund to other and different uses.</p>

<p>This is the general doctrine of
courts of equity as to charities, and
it is also applicable to ecclesiastical
matters.</p>

<p>In such case, where the trust is
confided to a religious congregation
or church government, it is not in
the power of the majority of that
congregation, however preponderant
by reason of a change of views on
religion, to carry the property so
confided to them to the support of
new and conflicting doctrine.</p>

<p>A pious man building and dedicating
a house of worship to the sole
and exclusive use of those who believe
in the doctrines of the Holy
Roman Catholic Church, and placing
it under the control of those who at
the time held the same belief, has a
right to expect that the law will prevent
that property from being used
for any other purpose whatsoever.
The law should throw its protection
around the trust, and it is the duty of
courts of law to enforce a trust clearly
defined, and to inquire whether
the party accused of violating the
trust is using the property so dedicated
as to defeat the declared objects
of the trust. In such cases, the right
to the use of the property must be
determined by the ordinary principles
which govern voluntary associations.</p>

<p>The same rule prevails as to the
class of cases coming within the
view of the third proposition, as to
property acquired in any of the
usual modes for the general use of a
religious congregation which is itself
part of a larger and general organization,
with which it is connected
by religious views and ecclesiastical
government, and which appeals to
the courts to determine the right to
the use of the property so acquired.
That is, where property has been purchased
for the use of the congregation,
and so long as any such body
can be ascertained to be of that congregation,
and is under its control
and bound by its orders and judgments,
or its regular and legitimate
successor, it is entitled to the use of
the property.</p>

<p>In this class of cases, the rule of
action which governs the civil courts
of the United States, as enunciated
by the highest legal tribunal, the
Supreme Court, is founded upon a
broad and sound view of the relations
of church and state, and is, that
wherever questions of faith or of discipline,
or ecclesiastical rule, custom,
or law, have been decided by the
highest of these church judicatories
to which the matter has been carried,
the legal tribunals must accept such
decisions as final, and as binding on
them in their application to the case
before them.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>In delivering the opinion of the
court in that case, the learned Mr.
Justice Miller said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In this country the full and free right to
entertain any religious belief, to practise
any religious principle, and to teach any
religious doctrine which does not violate
the laws of morality and property, and
which does not infringe personal rights,
is conceded to all. The law is not committed
to the support of any dogma, the
establishment of any sect. The right to
organize voluntary religious associations,
to assist in the expression and dissemination
of any religious doctrine, and to
create tribunals for the decision of controverted
questions of faith within the
association, and for the ecclesiastical
government of all the individual members,
congregations, and officers within
the general association, is unquestioned.
All who unite themselves to such a body
do so with an implied consent to this
government, and are bound to submit to
it. But it would be a vain consent, and
would lead to the total subversion of
such religious bodies, if any one aggrieved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>by one of their decisions could appeal
to the secular courts and have them reversed.
It is of the essence of these religious
unions, and of their right to establish
tribunals for the decision of
questions arising among themselves,
that those decisions should be binding
in all cases of ecclesiastical cognizance,
subject to only such appeals as the organism
itself provides for.</p>

<p>"Nor do we see that justice would be
likely to be promoted by submitting
those decisions to review in the ordinary
judicial tribunals.</p>

<p>"The Catholic Church has constitutional
and ecclesiastical laws of its own
that task the ablest minds to become
familiar with. It cannot be expected
that judges of the civil courts can be as
competent in the ecclesiastical law as
the ablest men in the church. It would
therefore be an appeal from the more
learned tribunal in the law, which should
decide the case, to one which is less so.</p>

<p>"These views are supported by the
preponderant weight of authority in this
country."</p></div>

<p>And according to the American
rule, where the subject-matter of dispute,
inquiry, or decision is strictly
and purely ecclesiastical in its character,
it is a matter over which the civil
courts should not exercise any jurisdiction&mdash;a
matter which concerns
theological controversy, church discipline,
ecclesiastical government, or
the conformity of the members of the
church to the standard of morals required
of them, the civil court has
not and should not have any jurisdiction.
If the civil courts were at
liberty to inquire into the whole subject
of doctrinal theology, usages, and
customs, the written laws and fundamental
principles would have to be
examined into with minuteness and
care, for they would be the criteria
by which the validity of the ecclesiastical
decree would be determined in
the civil court. And that would deprive
the authorities of the church
of their proper right and power to
construe their own church laws, and
would open the way to the evil of
transferring to the civil courts, where
the rights to property were concerned,
the decision of all ecclesiastical
questions.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Of all the cases in which this doctrine
is applied, no better representative
can be found than that of Shannon
<em>v.</em> Frost,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> where the principle is ably
supported by the learned Chief-Justice
of the Court of Appeals of Kentucky,
wherein he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"This court, having no ecclesiastical
jurisdiction, cannot revise or question
ordinary acts of church discipline. Our
only judicial power in the case arises
from the conflicting claims of the parties
in the church property, and the use of it.
We cannot decide who ought to be members
of the church, nor whether the excommunicated
have been justly or unjustly,
regularly or irregularly, cut off
from the body of the church."</p></div>

<p>The same principle was laid down
in the subsequent case of Gibson <em>v.</em>
Armstrong,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and of Watson <em>v.</em> Avery.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>One of the most careful and well-considered
judgments on the subject
is that of the Court of Appeals of
South Carolina, delivered by Chancellor
Johnson in the case of Harmon
<em>v.</em> Dreher.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> That case turned
upon certain rights in the use of
church property claimed by the minister,
notwithstanding his expulsion
from the synod as one of its members:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"He stands," says the chancellor,
"convicted of the offences alleged against
him by the sentence of the spiritual body
of which he was a voluntary member, and
whose proceedings he had bound himself
to abide. It belongs not to the civil
power to enter into or review the proceedings
of a spiritual court. The structure
of our government has for the preservation
of religious liberty rescued the
temporal institutions from religious interference;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>on the other hand, it has secured
religious liberty from the invasion of the
civil authority. The judgments, therefore,
of religious associations, bearing on
their own members, are not examinable
here; and I am not to enquire whether
the doctrines attributed to Mr. Dreher
were held by him, or whether, if held,
were anti-Lutheran, or whether his conduct
was or was not in accordance with
the duty he owed to the synod or to his
denomination.... When a civil right
depends upon an ecclesiastical matter,
it is the civil court and not the ecclesiastical
which is to decide. But the civil
tribunal tries the civil right, and no more,
taking the ecclesiastical decisions out of
which the civil right arises as it finds
them."</p></div>

<p>This principle is reaffirmed by the
same court in the John's Island
Church case.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> And in Den <em>v.</em> Bolton<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
the Supreme Court of New
Jersey asserts the same principle.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court of Illinois, in
the case of Ferraria <em>v.</em> Vascouelles,
refers to the case of Shannon <em>v.</em>
Frost with approval, and adopts the
language of the court, that the judicial
eye cannot penetrate the veil
of the church for the forbidden purpose
of vindicating the alleged
wrongs of excised members; when
they became members, they did so
upon the condition of continuing or
not as they and their churches might
determine, and they thereby submit
to the ecclesiastical power, and cannot
now invoke the supervisory
power of the civil tribunals.</p>

<p>And in the case of Chase <em>v.</em> Cheney,
recently decided in the same (Illinois)
court, Judge Lawrence says:
"The opinion implies that in the administration
of ecclesiastical discipline,
and where no other right of
property is involved, their loss of
the clerical office or salary incident
to such discipline, a spiritual court is
the exclusive judge of its own jurisdiction,
and that its decision of that
question is binding on the secular
courts."</p>

<p>In the case of Watson <em>v.</em> Ferris,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
which was a case growing out of the
schism in the Presbyterian Church
in Missouri, the court held that
whether a case was regularly or irregularly
before the assembly, was a
question which the assembly had the
right to determine for itself, and no
civil court could reverse, modify, or
impair its action in a matter of merely
ecclesiastical concern.</p>

<p>The opinion of the Supreme Court
of Pennsylvania, expressed in the
case of the German Reformed
Church <em>v.</em> Seibert,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> sets forth that
the decisions of ecclesiastical courts,
like every other judicial tribunal,
are final, as they are the best
judges of what constitutes an offence
against the word of God and the
discipline of the church. Any other
than those courts must be incompetent
judges of matters of faith, discipline,
and doctrine; and civil courts,
if they should be so unwise as to attempt
to supervise their judgments on
matters which come within their
jurisdiction, would only involve
themselves in a sea of uncertainty
and doubt, which would do anything
but improve religion and good
morals.</p>

<p>In the subsequent case of McGinnis
<em>v.</em> Watson,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> this principle is
again applied and supported by a
more elaborate argument.</p>

<p>Lord Chancellor Eldon, upon delivering
the opinion of the House of
Lords in the celebrated test-case of
Craigdallie <em>v.</em> Aikman, reported in
2 <cite>Bligh</cite>, 529 (1 <cite>Dow</cite>, 1), said: That
they (the law lords) had adopted
this principle as their rule and guide
for cases of dispute respecting the
right to property conveyed for the
use of religious worship&mdash;that it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>a trust which is to be enforced for
the purpose of maintaining that religious
worship for which the property
was devoted, and in the event of
schism (the original deed having
made no provision for such cases)
its uses are to be enforced, not on
behalf of a majority of the congregation,
nor yet exclusively in behalf of
the party adhering to the general
body, but in favor of that part of the
society adhering to and maintaining
the original principles upon which
it was founded: the exclusive standard
or guide by which conflicting
claims are to be decided is adherence
to the church itself.</p>

<p>Regarding, therefore, church property,
or the property of religious
societies, communities, or orders, in
the same manner as the private property
of any other corporation or
individual, it may with safety be assumed
as a settled and fundamental
law that ought to be recognized by
every Christian and civilized state,
that it is bound to make just indemnity
and compensation to the citizen
or subject, society, or corporation, or
community, for all property taken
under the pressure of state necessity
for the public good, convenience, or
safety. The eminent domain of the
state should be so exercised as to
work no wrong, to inflict no private
injury, without giving to the party
aggrieved ample redress. This doctrine
was not engrafted on the public
law to give license to despotic and
arbitrary sovereigns. It has its foundation
in the organization of society,
and is essential to the maintenance
of public virtue in every government,
whether a republic, a monarchy, or a
despotism. It is of the very essence
of sovereignty, for without it a state
cannot perform its first and highest
duties&mdash;those required by justice and
righteousness. Whenever, therefore,
from necessity a state appropriates to
public use the private property of an
individual or of a corporation, lay or
religious, it is obliged by a law as imperative
as that by which it makes
the appropriation, to give to the party
aggrieved redress commensurate with
the injury sustained. Upon any other
principle the social compact would
work mischief and wrong. The state
might impoverish the citizen it was
established to protect, and trample
on those rights of property, security
for which was one of the great objects
of its creation.</p>

<p>All the elementary writers of authority
sustain these views of the
duty and obligations of states.</p>

<p>Justice requires, says Vattel, that
the community or individual be indemnified
at the public charge.</p>

<p>The taking, says Grotius, must be
for some public advantage; as, for
instance, in time of war, the erection
of a rampart or fortification, or where
his standing corn or storehouses are
destroyed to prevent their being of
use to the enemy, in which case the
person injured should receive a just
compensation for the loss he suffers out
of the common stock. The state is
obliged to repair the damage suffered
by any citizen out of the public funds.
The conversion cannot take place
either to gratify any whim, caprice, or
fashion; it must be an actual public
necessity. For, do we not read of an
instance where some king, perhaps
of Prussia, was erecting a magnificent
palace at his capital, and, in order to
carry out the design of the architect,
it became necessary to remove a
small unsightly tenement, the property
of a poor man, who, though
so poor, would not sell his place
or consent that it should be removed,
and there it remained for
years, an eyesore perhaps to many,
and yet the king, as the chief depositary
of justice, would not permit it to
be disturbed, although urged by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
flatterers and courtiers to do so, until
in lapse of years the owner died, and
his successors consented to sell. The
historian recalls the justice of the
king, that all honest and honorable
rulers and men might follow such a
noble example of honor and justice.
But can any one reasonably praise
such an act, and approve of the
confiscation of the houses of religious
and charitable associations in
Italy, and the very suppression and
wiping out of the corporation or society
itself, without trial, or charge of
offence or crime other than the offence
of doing good to the human race
without pay, fee, or reward here, but
looking only to heaven for recompense.</p>

<p>If the Italian government or parliament
may to-day confiscate or escheat
the property of Catholic communities,
and thus commit a breach
of the pact made by former rulers,
emperors, or governments with the
founders of such communities, disregarding
all inherent rights of succession
and perpetuity, may it not to-morrow
also commit a breach of its
own compacts or implied guarantees,
and confiscate or escheat all the
property of churches, school-houses,
colleges, of other denominations who
have lately or are now building them
within Italian jurisdiction? For
what obstacle is to prevent it doing
so? Having outraged and set aside
as nought the moral or human law,
styled law of nations, in this respect,
may it not do so again in any other,
from either whim or caprice? Unless
there is some power left in public
opinion to restrain it, this is a dilemma
from which all the arguments
of theoretical political economists or
logicians cannot relieve them.</p>

<p>Therefore, is it not a question now
well worthy the consideration of all
honest-thinking men, whether or not
they should aid public opinion in
sending forth a note of warning
against this doctrine of confiscation&mdash;for
else, perhaps, the disease may
make a wider sweep over the earth,
and parliaments or congresses be
elected for the purpose of confiscating
or escheating other property besides
church property or the property
of religious or charitable houses or
communities?</p>

<p>Judging from the tenor and tone
of American decisions&mdash;upon the
question involved&mdash;pronounced by
some of our ablest and purest men,
this "confiscation," or, more expressively,
this "spoliation" of the property
of the church and of religious orders,
by Victor Emanuel, under color
of parliamentary enactments, and tested
also by recognized rules of international
law, to say nothing of that
higher law which commands us to
"do unto others, etc.," such "confiscation"
is utterly indefensible upon
any doctrine other than that set forth
in the nefarious maxim, "To the
victors belong the spoils," and any
acquiescence on the part of the
Christian nations, Catholic or non-Catholic,
is simply disgraceful, and
an act of homage to the prince of
this world which is in itself an act of
dishonor towards God.</p>

<p>And as any title so acquired can
only be maintained so long as the
usurper has the material power to occupy
and defend, it is certain that
with the destruction of that power
the true and rightful owners may revive
and assert their rights of ownership
and possession, as the lawful successors
of the original grantors and
founders, regardless of any claims or
incumbrances whatsoever made or
suffered by intervening holders or
intruders.</p>

<h3>HOW GEORGE HOWARD WAS CURED.</h3>


<p>To give up the battle of life at any
age is bad, so long as a flicker of
life is left. It is like deserting the
doomed ship whilst the groaning
planks hold together; like refusing
to make one in the forlorn hope, but
choosing rather to sit down with
closed eyes, and let death come as it
may. But to give up the battle of
life at five-and-twenty, when the
battle can scarcely be said to have
begun, whilst the future lies hidden
behind an uncertain mist, when the
sinews are braced, the eyes clear, the
heart hopeful, the hair unsilvered&mdash;to
give it up then is like deserting
the ship whilst all is fair sailing, like
sneaking from the ranks at first scent
of the enemy. It is as cowardly as
for the sentinel to abandon his post
or the ensign to surrender without a
blow the colors which he swore to
defend to death; nay, as for the
husband to desert the wife he chose
out of all the world before God to be
his until death. Yet this was what
George Howard had done.</p>

<p>Of course a woman was in it, as
she is in most difficulties here below.
And is it not her province? If she
sometimes happen to be "in it" a
little too much, rather in the light
of an obstacle than a helper&mdash;well,
the best and not the worst must be
made of her under the awkward
circumstances. The first man, if
Mr. Darwin will excuse the heresy,
set us a good example in this way.
It was a pity that Eve did not turn
her ear away from the voice of the
charmer; but as she did the other
thing, and so wrought upon her husband
that he followed her example,
after all he made the very best of a
very bad bargain, and, like a true
man, stuck to his wife. But to return
from Adam to his XIXth century
descendant, Mr. George Howard:
Why had that promising
young gentleman metaphorically
"thrown up the sponge," and drawn
aside like a coward from the broad
road of life, to linger on uselessly in
this little out-of-the-way French town
where nobody knew him, where nobody
heard of him from the great
city at the other side of the ocean,
which he left one fine morning a
year or more ago without a word
of warning or a single good-by to
the many friends whose kindly eyes
had looked hopefully upon him, and
whose friendly lips had prophesied
success? Why had he gone out
from this busy heart of the New
World, palpitating with promise and
half-defined yearnings, to bury himself
away in this silent nook in an obscure
corner of the south of France,
doing nothing, caring nothing, planning
nothing, wearily waiting for life
to end?</p>

<p>As is generally the case with despairing
five-and-twenty in the masculine,
and despondent seventeen or
eighteen in the feminine, sex, it was
one of those peculiar difficulties
known as "affairs of the heart."
Nobody ever knew the exact ins and
outs of it; how far the lady was to
blame, and how far George had himself
to accuse. Like many a passionate,
high-souled young man,
where he bestowed his heart he expected
that heart to absorb and fill
up the life and soul of the woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
he loved. That effect does follow
generally, but by degrees more or
less slow. George was apt to love too
fiercely and too fast. But young,
high-spirited girls like to be wooed
before they are won. Though their
hearts may have been virtually taken
by storm long before the besieging
party so much as suspect that a
breach has been made in the stubborn
fortress, still they like to make
a show of surrendering at discretion,
and marching out with all the honors
of war, rather than be instantly and
absolutely overwhelmed by love.
There is such a thing as a surfeit
of happiness. George Howard had
probably made this mistake. Such
lovers as he are apt to start at shadows,
imagining them realities. The
end of it was that George's fortress
surrendered to somebody else, married
the conqueror, and was disgracefully
happy. Whether or not she
ever cast a thought back on the
bright young fellow that once loved
her so fiercely, who can tell? Probably
not. She made a good match&mdash;and
contented wives soon drop
romance; sooner than husbands
often. It is astonishing how easily
the goddess we adore before marriage
descends from the clouds, walks the
earth like a sturdy woman, and becomes
a practical, sensible wife. It
may be a little unromantic at first
sight, but it is undoubtedly by far
the best thing she could do under
the circumstances. But when poor
George saw his goddess riding about
smiling and happy by the side of her
husband, and that husband not himself,
he could not endure the sight.
After lingering a little in misery, he
threw up his connections, and left
the city for what destination nobody
knew.</p>

<p>George Howard was alone in the
world. His mother had died early;
his father went off when George was
twenty, leaving him fortune enough
to help him to make life as pleasant
as he chose to make it for himself.
He was advancing rapidly in his profession&mdash;law&mdash;and
had made a host
of friends when the collapse came.
As is so often the case, his pride,
instead of sustaining him, sank under
the blow. Most probably, if the
truth were told, the wound inflicted
on his self-esteem rankled deeper
than that which had killed his love.
The thought that another man could
succeed where George Howard had
failed would have been gall and
wormwood to him in any case; but
when the object of rivalry was a
woman's heart, and George Howard's
were the rejected addresses, death
would be a small word to express
the consummation of that gentleman's
misery; it was the annihilation
of all that made life worth the living.
"Howard the jilted," he seemed to
read in everybody's eye, when perhaps
not half a dozen persons knew
anything about the affair. Jilted by
a girl! How could a man recover
such a blow? What was there in
the wide world to fill up the void left
in one when his mighty self shrank
to such insignificant proportions?</p>

<p>Common sense might have suggested
that there was more than one
woman in the world, and that there
lay a deeper fund of love in the heart
of a man than could be exhausted
on the first girl he chanced to meet
and admire. It might have suggested
also that failure in love did not
necessarily mean failure in matters
which, after all, as far as the world
outside of our little selves is concerned,
are of far more importance than
love. Man is not sent into this
world for the one purpose of being
"married and done for," as the
phrase goes. But when did common
sense find the ear of a lover, particularly
of a lover rejected?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>So here was George Howard,
clever enough, good-looking enough,
and by no means a bad fellow, self-stranded
on the barren sand-banks
of life, with a short five-and-twenty
years behind him, a future full of
fair promise still before him, hugging
a useless sorrow in silent sadness, and
making that his bride.</p>

<p>He lived on listlessly from day to
day. He mixed with no circle; he
knew nobody. He took his meals at
his hotel, addressed a few commonplaces
to those he happened to meet,
and passed most of his time in the
open air, taking long strolls into the
country, walking up and down the
beach by the sea, watching the
solitary sails that came and went
and faded out of sight&mdash;sadly, it
seemed to him sometimes, as though
beckoning him back to a living
world. There were few visitors at
the little town, save just during the
hottest of the summer months. Such
as did come hurried away again as
fast as they could. The train rushed
through it day after day, a crowd of
peering faces would show themselves
a few moments at the windows of
the cars, strange eyes would stare
curiously at the strange place, and
pass on a moment after as indifferent
as before. Something of the instinct
which prompts a wounded animal to
seek out a silent covert where it may
lie down with its wound and die
alone, must have conducted George
Howard to this spot.</p>

<p>Yet to a man who had only gone
there for a short holiday, weary
awhile of the rush, and the struggle,
and the incessant strain and roar of
a busier life, the little French town,
with its quaint look and quaint ways,
might have offered a refreshing relief
from the dust, and the turmoil, and
the worry of the world of politics and
money, railroads and trade. Many
a one doubtless has at some time or
other had the wish to wake up some
morning a century or two ago in a
world that had gone away. To such
the placid evenings by the sea, the
homely looks of the inhabitants, the
clean blouses of the men, the white
caps of the women, the busy tongues
of the children, the long silver hair
of M. le Curé, the dances by the
sea as the sun went down, the slow
wains drawn by drowsy oxen, the fuss
and bustle of the weekly market-day,
the big <em>gendarme</em> with his clanking
sword, the white houses and their antique
gables, with the beat of the surf
on the beach for ever, and the fresh
odor of the ocean pervading all places,
would have seemed the delicious
realization of many a picture looked
on and lingered over in a gilded
frame.</p>

<p>But on the deadened senses of
George Howard these simple scenes,
and sights, and sounds fell as you
might fancy the roll of the muffled
drums to fall on the one stretched
out in the coffin who is being borne
speedily on by the living to his grave.
They wake no life in him; he makes
no stir; he is let down into the earth&mdash;a
farewell roll, and the grave is
closed over him for ever, whilst the
bright world above seems to smile
the merrier that another dead man
is hidden away.</p>

<p>Of course, this kind of life and
mode of thought were rapidly telling
on him and bringing nearer and
nearer the consummation he seemed
to desire. The step grew slower,
the eyes began to lose their quick
lustre, the cheek its flush, the body
its swing and half-defiant bearing.
The simple people round about looked
at him silently, shook their heads,
and sighed as he moved by without
noticing them. He grew more and
more attached to the beach, where he
would stroll up and down and sit
for hours on the yellow sand, staring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
out blankly at the broad water, casting
a pebble into it from time to
time, and watching the circles that
it made. There was something congenial
to his nature in the changeable
face and mood, the smile, the frown,
the hoarse breathing, the sob, the
sigh, the roar, the rage of the ocean.
To all these changes something within
him gave a voice, until the very
spirit of the mysterious deep seemed
to creep into his being, and make it
an abode there.</p>

<p>So he lived on, never writing to a
friend, never yearning to go back to
the world he had quitted, and which
still held out its arms to him. All
ambition, all desire of achievement,
all common feeling with the world
into which he had been born, seemed
to have gradually oozed out of him.
He had staked his happiness and
lost, and now he only wished for the
end to come soon. It never occurred
to him that he had possibly staked
his happiness at too low a figure.
He only saw before him an empty
life with a dreary existence. At such
stages, some men commit suicide.
He was not yet coward enough for
that, though not Christian enough
to perceive that this world was not
made for one man and one woman
only, but for all the children of
Adam.</p>

<p>But happily, however man may
reject Providence, and close his eyes
to a Power that shapeth all things for
good, Providence mercifully refuses
to reject him without at least giving
him plenty of opportunities, humanly
called chances, to come back to
the possession of his senses, and the
fulfilment of the mission which is appointed
unto every man. And one
of George Howard's chances came
about this wise.</p>

<p>A favorite walk of his was along a
winding road leading some distance
out of the little town up a lofty hill,
from the summit of which the eye
could scan the sweeping circle of the
waters, stretching out in its glittering
wonder to the verge of dimness, or,
inland, where miles and miles of fair
pasture-land and vineyards spread
away in gentle undulations, with
smoke rising from hollows in which
hamlets slept, and church spires
clove the clear air, and airy villas
crowned the pleasant hills. Alternate
gleams of sea and land shot
through the tall poplars that lined
the road as it circled round the hill.
At the top, buried amid trees, and
fronted by a garden filled almost the
year through with delicious flowers,
was the Maison Plaquet, a sort of
<em>café</em>, where visitors could procure a
cup of coffee, a glass of <i lang="fr">eau sucrée</i>,
or the good wines <i lang="fr">du pays</i>. This
establishment was presided over by
Mme. Plaquet, a buxom dame with a
merry eye and kindly voice, whose
pleasant face had become quite a
part of the landscape. There was
understood to be a M. Plaquet
somewhere, but he did not often
show himself to visitors. He left
the whole business to madame, having
a strong suspicion that there was
no woman like her in the world, and
spent most of his time trimming
the flower-beds, pruning the trees, or
tending to the vineyard.</p>

<p>George was a frequent visitor at
the Maison Plaquet. He would
spend hours in the garden dreaming.
Madame was won by his handsome
face and the fixed sadness in his eyes,
which always lighted up, however, in
response to her genial greeting. She
half suspected that it was something
more than a love of nature which
sent the <i lang="fr">pauvre garçon</i>, as she called
him, away from friends, and home,
and family, to sit there day after day
dreaming in her arbor, beautiful as it
was. With the chatty good-nature
which in a Frenchwoman never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
seems offensive, she would sometimes
try to draw him out of himself, to
learn something about him that might
help her to lift the settled cloud off
his handsome face. To Mme. Plaquet
it seemed almost a sin against
the good God to wear a cloudy face
always. But George was so jealously
reserved that she gave him up,
with the secret conviction that it was
love alone that could inflict so deep
a wound on so young a heart, and
that love alone could heal it.</p>

<p>One afternoon, whilst George was
reclining in the arbor, a riding party
of gay cavaliers and dames showed
themselves suddenly in front of the
Maison Plaquet. Exclamations of
delight at the beauty of the scene
burst from one and another. One
fair young girl stood her horse just
at the entrance to the arbor, and, to
those within, completely filled in the
picture. Thus she met the dreamy
eyes of Mr. George Howard. The
steed was a little restive, but with a
firm though gentle hand she curbed
him until he stood still as death and
she upon him. The light hat she
wore was thrown back, showing a
shapely head with glossy curls, around
which the sun made a glory under
the clustering blossoms. For a moment
horse and rider seemed to stand
out startlingly clear from the sky,
and for that moment George allowed
his eyes to linger there as upon a
striking picture. A moment after,
the party had dismounted, entered
the arbor, and seated themselves at
a table opposite to our friend. As
the centre figure of the picture which
had attracted his gaze passed, she
glanced at him, and he had a momentary
view of a blooming cheek
and a pair of those large, soft, but
courageous eyes, filled with that
courage which makes a man reverence
a woman&mdash;eyes round, and full,
and clear as a child's, that fear no
evil without, because they are conscious
of none within. The party
was a gay one, and their gaiety
grated on George's ear. He rose
and sauntered down the hill, a little
sadder, if possible, than when he had
ascended it.</p>

<p>After his departure, one of the
gentlemen, an old acquaintance of
Mme. Plaquet's apparently, inquired
of her who her strange visitor might
be whom he had met there more
than once, and always alone.</p>

<p>Madame, with a sigh and many a
shrug, and much amiable volubility,
told the company that she knew
nothing at all about him, save that
he lived in the little town <i lang="fr">en bas</i>,
that he came there very often, that
he was evidently suffering from some
great trouble, that he was a good
gentleman and always gave something
to the poor when they asked
him, and that it was a great pity so
handsome a young gentleman should
offend the good God by not being
happy.</p>

<p>The ladies were quite interested in
madame's narrative. Ladies will be
interested about good-looking young
men who are suffering from that romantic
complaint, an incurable melancholy.
But as madame's narrative,
eloquent and pathetic though it
was, left them in much the same
state of enlightenment as before with
regard to the interesting stranger, all
they could do was sigh a little, remount,
and resume their gay tone.
Just as they were commencing the
descent, a hare started and frightened
the horse of the young lady who
had attracted George's attention. A
plunge, a rear, and an instant after it
was out of sight, thundering down
the steep road at a speed that mocked
pursuit.</p>

<p>George was strolling along in his
listless way, stopping now at this
turn, now at that, to admire the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
scenery, pluck a flower or a leaf, and
muse a little. He had almost arrived
at the foot of the hill, when a cry
from above and a clatter of hoofs
broke on his ear. He stood at a
narrow turn between two high banks
opening into the last bend of the
road, to listen and observe. A moment
after, a horse with a lady on his
back came tearing down at a mad
speed right on him. A glance showed
that the rider stood in imminent
danger of her life, and that the only
means of saving her was to stop the
animal in the midst of its wild career.
The thought and determination to
do something had scarcely time to
flash through his brain, when the
horse was on him; and how he never
knew, but he found himself dragging
at the reins&mdash;a stumble of the steed
against the bank as it swerved, a
fainting lady in his arms, and a moment
after a crowd of persons around
them. He surrendered her to the
care of her friends, and, seeing her
revive whilst they were engaged in
tending her, took occasion to slink
away unobserved, as though he had
been guilty of some mean action.
And the Maison Plaquet saw him no
more.</p>

<p>About a week after this occurrence,
he was taking one of his usual
moody walks along the beach, his
hands clasped behind him, and his
eyes following the golden path that
led away over the waters down to
the sinking sun. He walked along
listlessly, insensible to everything
save the subtle solemnity of the hour,
when the brooding calm of the evening
began to settle over the crimson
wave and the flushed earth. He
did not observe a figure leaning
against a huge boulder that lay rosy-red
right in his path. The leaning
figure was that of a young man, who,
like George, was surveying the scene,
but with an air of genuine admiration
curiously tempered by the eye
of a connoisseur examining a painting
as to the merits or defects of
which his oracular opinion might be
called for at any moment by a listening
world. Let us look at him as
he leans back there, so contented, to
all seeming, with the world in general,
and possibly with himself in particular;
for notwithstanding an occasional
touch of what in others would
be called impertinence, but in him
was really rather assumed than natural,
and, as he was wont to say, often
got him out of difficulties, Ned Fitzgerald
was a fellow you would like.</p>

<p>His slim, well-knit figure, clad in a
light summer suit, his pleasant, animated
face surmounted by a straw
hat that became him, his bright
eyes glancing around and taking all
in in a sweep&mdash;the sinking sun, the
mingling colors on the waters, the
flush on the hills, the blood-red
glow on the sands, the quiet circles
of a solitary sea-bird that turned and
dipped its snow-white wings in the
rosy light&mdash;to one looking at him, he
made nature seem all the more lovely
and enjoyable for having one who
could feel its loveliness so thoroughly
and so evidently.</p>

<p>The quick eye did not take long
to pick out the slightly stooped figure
that seemed so wrapt in silent
thought, and, as it neared him, never
turned its gaze from the dying sun.
Mr. Ned Fitzgerald watched its approach,
and, with his usual tendency
to be sociable, evidently contemplated
addressing it; when, as it came
close enough to distinguish the features,
he started from his recumbent
position, took off his hat and tossed
it wildly in the air, never waiting to
catch it again, but, rushing towards
George, seized that astounded and
miserable mortal in his arms, and
hugged him almost to suffocation
before he could see who it was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
whilst the exclamation burst from
him:</p>

<p>"Why, George Howard, by all
that's impossible!"</p>

<p>Another hug and a longer one,
and a hearty laugh, and a shake of
both hands up and down, and a look
of genuine pleasure in the bright
eyes that seemed to throw a light
over the kindly face&mdash;Ned's pleasantry
was contagious, and the first
flush of surprise on George's face
was succeeded by a faint smile as
soon as he recognized his old friend
and school-fellow, whilst a sort of
moisture forced itself into his own
eyes. It was as though he had come
back from the grave a moment to
find that after all the hand shaken
so vigorously by an old friend&mdash;the
best-liked old friend of them all, who
had studied with him, and fought
with him, and played with him, and
got into all sorts of scrapes and out
of them with him, and built with
him those bubble castles that boys
will build at school, destitute of
nothing save foundation&mdash;was still
real flesh and blood, and that the
heart throbbing within him was still
human.</p>

<p>"Why, Ned, old fellow, what in
the name of wonder brought you
here?"</p>

<p>"Destiny, my boy, destiny, fate&mdash;anything
you please that may give
a sufficiently solemn turn to a landslip
close by which interfered considerably
with locomotion, and forced
me bag and baggage out of my
snug <em>coupé</em>, to set me down in this
unknown corner of the earth, absolutely
without a soul to speak to, for
one night. But I do believe I could
have endured a broken head as well
as a broken journey for the sake of
dropping on you again, old boy."</p>

<p>Why young gentlemen, supposed
to know the meaning of words,
should find such a secret fund of
special endearment in the terms
which they so lavishly apply to one
another of "old boy," "old fellow,"
or "old man," is a mystery
whose solution is still to appear.
Young persons of the opposite sex, as
it is called&mdash;goodness knows why&mdash;are
not in the habit of addressing
each other as "old woman," "old
duck," or "old maid." Such terms
would be esteemed in them as anything
but endearing, although married
ladies have been known to
speak of their lord and master as "a
dear, good old thing." However, to
return from this digression, which is
becoming dangerous, to the "old"
men in question:</p>

<p>"Well, Ned, I am really glad to
see you," said George, and then
added slowly, as the old chill came
back to him, "and that's more than
I'd say to many an old acquaintance&mdash;now."</p>

<p>He looked away moodily to where
the sun had gone down, as the gray
began to settle over the water.
Ned took a quick glance at his
friend, and saw that, as he expressed
it to himself, "all was not right
somewhere." He had seen very
little of Howard since they left college,
and knew nothing of what had
driven him from New York. However,
he determined to take no notice
of his last remark for the present,
but said gaily:</p>

<p>"This sea of yours gives one a
tremendous appetite. I move dinner.
There's nothing like dinner to
liven up a man's wits. Come along,
George. We have had our fill of
gorgeous sunsets and scenery for one
day. There's a poetry as well as a
glare in the gaslight when it shines
on a well-spread table. What! you
have no gas here? Happy people!
One tax the less. But it is to be
hoped you find something to eat in
this backbone of the world. Now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
come along, and we'll have all the
adventures by flood and field with
the cigars."</p>

<p>Ned was at his best during dinner,
though, for that matter, he seemed
always at his best. His presence
gave a pleasant flavor to dishes
which time after time George had
turned away from with disgust. He
had an original remark for everything.
And the polite French waiter
was rather astonished as the dinner
progressed to see M. O&mdash;art, as the
domestics called George, give vent
to an occasional laugh, which grew
and grew, until the two old friends
became almost as uproarious as a
couple of school-boys out for a holiday.</p>

<p>That delicious after-dinner moment
having arrived when the cigars
are lighted and the legs stretched
out in lazy contentment, without the
slightest regard for "the proprieties"&mdash;nobody
but themselves being present&mdash;they
began their questionings
and cross-questionings. George was
the first to start.</p>

<p>"Well, Ned, what in the name
of good fortune brought you down
here? What are you doing? Still
writing?"</p>

<p>"Yes. At present I am despatched
on a secret diplomatic mission,
which of course it is impossible for
me to divulge, by the editor of the
greatest daily in the world. You
know what that means."</p>

<p>"Well, I can guess. The particular
'greatest daily' does not matter
much. There are so many."</p>

<p>"Yes; and the fun of it is, I write
for them all. The six or seven special
correspondents who keep New
York and London on the <i lang="fr">qui vive</i>
with regard to European affairs, and
who lay bare to their wondering
vision from time to time the real
undercurrent of those affairs, social,
political, and religious, are often one
and the same with your Mephistophelian
friend."</p>

<p>"Bohemianizing, eh? Why, I
took you to be respectable, Ned.
Ah! a newspaper office is a sadly
demoralizing place."</p>

<p>"Pshaw! What will you have?
The public wants news, and somebody
must furnish it. People nowadays
are much the same as people
ever were. Humanity must have
something to talk about, or it could
not exist. Humanity is a woman."</p>

<p>"I agree with you there; that is
why I have abandoned it."</p>

<p>"Oh! I see what you would say.
There are two sides to that. But
what I mean is, we must talk, or the
world will come to a stand-still. The
newspaper man nowadays furnishes
the staple commodity on which the
world exercises its tongue."</p>

<p>"Nowadays, yes. Well, it's a poor
commodity. Somebody has well called
it the 'cheap and nasty.'"</p>

<p>"Always the same, George; always
the same. What was the cry of
the Athenians when S. Paul went
amongst them? 'What news? <i lang="la">Quid
novi?</i>'&mdash;and the Athenians were the
intellect of their time. To-day we
live too fast for the tongue; hence
electricity, hence the daily."</p>

<p>"Hence the Bohemian?"</p>

<p>"Well, Bohemian is a much-misapplied
word. It requires a sort of
genius to be a true Bohemian; erratic
genius, if you like, but still genius.
Bohemianism is not all boots down
at heel, crushed hat, and broken
elbows, five-cent cigars and lager-beer
that a friend pays for, with an
occasional bottle of champagne when
the pocket happens to be flush.
Look at me, for instance, supplying
the six or seven leading dailies with
news. If I tell a lie one day, I contradict
it the next. If I send a false
account to the government organ, I
send an extra true one to the oppo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>sition,
and a trimmer to the free and
independent. If the government is
malicious, the opposition is ultra
pious; and if the free and independent
is scandalous, both unite in
coming down on and crushing it. To
be sure, things get mixed up a little
sometimes; but, on the whole, matters
are pretty evenly balanced, and in
the end the truth comes uppermost.
Then all along you are supported
by the secret conviction that nobody
ever believes a word you say."</p>

<p>"Whose fault is that?" asked
George.</p>

<p>"The weakness of humanity, my
dear fellow. You must not go too
deeply into things, nor expect a daily
newspaper, with its villanous printers,
to be true as gospel. A newspaper
correspondent is despatched
to find news; and if he can't find
it...."</p>

<p>"He invents."</p>

<p>"Well, what is the use of imagination,
unless you exercise it a bit?
But it is the greatest fun in the
world to see yourself quoted by opposite
parties for opposite purposes."</p>

<p>"Yes, it must be amusing. Some
people&mdash;old-fashioned people, to be
sure&mdash;might consider it a trifle dishonest,
perhaps; but then, they are
behind the age."</p>

<p>Ned rose, laughed, and took a
turn round the room. Standing opposite
his friend, he said:</p>

<p>"So, George, I find I have succeeded
in giving you an exalted idea
of my character and ability already.
Have you forgotten that famous gift
I had of extemporizing yarns at
school? Well, to relieve your mind,
the devil&mdash;that is to say, Mr. Edward
Fitzgerald&mdash;is not quite so black as
he has painted himself. Nor, indeed,
am I quite so powerful and fluent a
writer as I have imagined. I am on
a mission here, though; partly business,
and partly to take my sister
back with me to New York. She
has been staying with some of her
school friends, convent companions.
I was on my way to join them when
this lucky accident tumbled me into
your hermitage. And now, what
has brought you here? You seem
quite domiciled. Why, I expected
to have heard great things of you
by this time."</p>

<p>"I? Oh! I am doing nothing,"
said George, with a sigh, coming
back to himself.</p>

<p>"Nothing! Well, that is not such
a bad occupation when you only
know how to do it, and can find no
other employment."</p>

<p>"Why, what else can a fellow
do?"</p>

<p>Ned was fairly taken aback at this
question. To ask him what a fellow
could do in this world was like asking
him why he had teeth, or hands,
or a head, or life altogether. After
an amazed stare at his friend, he
answered:</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose that what a man
can do is generally best known to
himself, when, like you, he has life in
his veins, brains in his head, and
money in his pocket. At all events,
it is scarcely likely that you were
made for the precise purpose of burying
yourself alive here."</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't know. It is not
such a bad sort of life," said George
wearily. "Here I have no cares,
and fuss, and bother, no visitors to
bore, and no bores to visit. Nobody
comes to borrow or beg. There is
no necessity for playing at compliments
with people for whom you do
not care a straw, and who care for
you less. Here is, instead, the sea,
and the shore, and the woods, and
the hills, a fair table, a good enough
washerwoman, and people around
you who never speak till they are
spoken to. What more can a fellow
want?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned made no reply. He was
puffing his cigar in silence, and
following the curling smoke with his
eye as he blew it against the light&mdash;a
favorite fashion of his when thinking
to himself. He was thinking now,
rapidly, how changed was his friend
in so short a time. He was wondering
where all the ardent spirit and
high hopes that fired him a few years
back had gone. Contact with the
world, instead of crushing, had raised
his own hopes the more. Why had
it not done the same for Howard?
He could find no solution to the
difficulty; for life to him was a
glorious battle, and inaction worse
than death. His friend must have
encountered some great shock, some
bitter disappointment, at the outset.
He was seeking the clew in the
smoke apparently. After a painful
pause, he at length asked:</p>

<p>"How long have you been here
now, George?"</p>

<p>"On and off, a year or more. I
go and come. I make short excursions
round about for a week or
so sometimes, but I always return
here."</p>

<p>"You entered a firm on the other
side, did you not?"</p>

<p>"No; I was about to do so."</p>

<p>"And why didn't you? Were
they cheats?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Did they fail?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Did <em>you</em> fail? Did you lose any
money in any way?"</p>

<p>"No, what makes you ask?"</p>

<p>"Because I want to find out what
the trouble is with you. You are
not in love?"</p>

<p>"Good God! No!" exclaimed
George almost fiercely, as he rose,
strode to the window, and stood there
looking out at the moon.</p>

<p>The bitterness of his tone, the
abruptness of his action, told the
observant Ned that unwittingly he
had touched the right chord. He
indulged in a silent whistle to himself,
and shook his head as a good-hearted
physician might over a hopeless
case. Ned confessed himself a
bad hand at ministering to the love
complaint. That was the only ill for
which he would advocate the calling
in of a female physician. For heart
disease of this nature, Ned would, on
his own authority, grant a diploma
to any suitable lady doctor; for he
was convinced of the utter inability
of man to handle such a delicate
affair. So he shook his head despondently.</p>

<p>Whilst these thoughts were passing
through the brain of the now
very wide-awake Mr. Fitzgerald,
George seemed to have recovered
his usual dead calm, and, leaving the
window as he proceeded to light a
fresh cigar, inquired, with a smile
that seemed to anticipate a characteristic
answer:</p>

<p>"Ned, have you ever been in
love?"</p>

<p>It was now Ned's turn to rise.
He tore about the room frantically
a moment, dashed his hand through
his hair, and finally, coming to a
stand-still before his amused friend,
burst out:</p>

<p>"In love! Have I ever been in
love? What a question to ask a
man! Don't you know my name?
Did you ever hear of a Fitzgerald or
any other of his race who had not
been in love? Why, man, I fall in
love every day of my life. How
can I help it when every woman I
see for five minutes falls in love with
me. I might say I have lost my
heart so often that I don't think
there's a bit of it left to lose now;
and still I go on falling in love by
sheer force of habit." And Ned
"hove to" with a comic burst of
despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are a happy man, Ned,"
said George, laughing.</p>

<p>"Happy?" questioned Ned, half
to himself, and as though the idea
had struck him for the first time in
his life. "Well, I suppose I am.
I don't see much advantage to be
gained by being otherwise."</p>

<p>"Nor I; but, for all that, people
differently constructed from your fortunate
self cannot always help being
otherwise."</p>

<p>"Bah! Of course they can; particularly
in love matters. Love was
not meant to make a man mope,
but to stir him up. Those old fogies
in the middle ages had a much truer
idea of love, as of many other things,
than we have nowadays, with all our
boasting. Ah! love then was the
genuine article. Not all sighs, and
tears, and millinery, and newspaper
paragraphs, and mothers-in-law, and
the lovers playing cat's-cradle to
each other. No; but the man went
about his business, bearing his love in
his heart for a year and a day. He
wore his lady's gage on his helm, and,
if his business happened to be the
giving and taking of hard knocks,
why, he gave and took, his love and
himself against the world. He rode
in the lists under his lady's eye, and
proved himself a brave man for her
sake. Love nerved his arm, whilst
it purified his heart and softened
his soul. Why did the wife gird
the buckler on her lord? Love was
akin to religion then, marriage a sacrament,
and not, as it now is...."</p>

<p>"A social exchange, a trade carried
on by the great Mother-in-law Company,
Unlimited&mdash;a thing of barter
and loss, where dollars are wedded to
dollars by the magistrate, where youth
and beauty sells herself to old age for
so much a year and her own carriage.
O Ned, Ned! what a pity we
were not born in the middle ages!"</p>

<p>"Hallo!" said Ned, "I did not
mean to go quite so far as that,
George. After all, they were men and
women then, just as we are; and,
though one cannot help breaking out
now and again on modern notions,
one thing is certain&mdash;for every true
knight there is somewhere a true
lady."</p>

<p>"Have you found yours yet,
Ned?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, perhaps yes," said
Ned, dropping a moment his light
tone. "Perhaps because I am not
a true knight; perhaps because,
though I found a true lady, she was
meant for somebody else. Because
I may have made one mistake, that
is no reason why my true lady should
not be waiting for me somewhere,
nor why I should fail to rejoice at
seeing two others happy, though my
own toes may have been trodden on
a little bit. After all, the world is
very wide and full of happy possibilities."</p>

<p>Something unusual in Ned's tone
seemed to spring from real feeling
that lay concealed under his usual
airy manner; perhaps suffering, with
which his good-nature cared not to
trouble the sufficiently trouble-laden
world. For the first time in his life,
George Howard felt a little ashamed
of himself, and conscious of something
akin to selfishness in his nature which
he had never suspected there before.
It takes a very long time to see ourselves.
Self-knowledge comes piecemeal,
and the pieces that go to make
the human mosaic are sometimes
very ugly when seen alone, though
they may pass muster in the whole,
and merge and be lost in its common
symmetry.</p>

<p>When he awoke the following
morning, and the thought came to
him that the usually dreary day was
to be enlivened for once by the presence
of Ned Fitzgerald, the thought
was not an unpleasant one; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
when that gentleman burst into his
room with a bundle of sea-weed in
his hand, speckled all over with curious
little shells, which he said he
would keep for Mary, the look of
young, active, earnest life in his
bright eyes and diffused over his
whole person seemed in some indescribable
manner to make the sun
brighter and the air clearer. George
began to feel young again, and examined
the shells and the slimy
weed, over which Ned gloated and
expatiated, with an interest that
would have been a marvel to him
yesterday.</p>

<p>"And who is Mary?" he asked,
as that name passed Ned's lips more
than once.</p>

<p>"Why, the sister I was telling you
about."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said George, and was silent.</p>

<p>That evening, it was arranged that
Ned should go the next day, and
bring Mary back with him. As he
found the little town so quaint and
quiet, he determined to stay a week
or so with his old friend, instead of
going on directly to Paris, as he had
intended; and George, to pass the
interval, made his first visit since the
accident to his friend, Mme. Plaquet.</p>

<p>That good dame was as angry as
she could be with him. Why had
he not come to see her for so long?
What had he been doing? Was he
sick from the dragging that <em>méchant</em>,
the horse, had given him? How
did she know about it? Why, had
not M. de Lorme and the ladies been
there almost every day since, and all
on purpose to meet him and thank
him for his brave service? And now,
was not mademoiselle going away,
and her heart breaking because she
could not see her preserver, and
thank him for saving her life? And
there was the card and the letter
of M. de Lorme waiting for him all
these days. She would not have it
sent, because she expected monsieur to
come every day. Ah! it was cruel!</p>

<p>George opened the letter, and
found that it was an eulogium of
M. de Lorme on his gallantry and
devotion, to which he was indebted
for the life, probably, of his charming
young friend; that her brave but unknown
preserver would confer an
honor on her and on M. de Lorme
by favoring them with his distinguished
friendship; that it was
cruel of him to escape from them
whilst they were all engaged with
his charming young friend; that he
hoped he would excuse this mode
of addressing him, as, owing to the
peculiarity of the circumstances, he
knew of no other; and that, as his
charming young friend was about to
leave them, he would no longer deny
them the opportunity, so much desired,
of paying the deep debt of
gratitude they owed him, by allowing
them to testify in person their admiration
of his admirable courage and
chivalrous devotion.</p>

<p>"Well, and what do you say?"
asked Mme. Plaquet, as, with arms
folded and a general air of mistress of
the situation, she surveyed her mysterious
young friend, whilst, with a half-amused
countenance, he read M. de
Lorme's missive.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said George, "I don't
know. What a fuss you French people
make about stopping a horse!
There&mdash;don't say any more about
it. I have a friend staying with
me who knows how to arrange all
these matters, and I will consult him.
To-morrow or the day after he shall
come to see you. You will like him.
Is the lady quite recovered?"</p>

<p>"Entirely. But she looked so sad
when she came, and came, and never
found you. Ah! if I were a handsome
young man, how many horses would
I not stop, only to get one such glance
from such lovely eyes!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning, Ned was to return
with his sister, and George went
down to the railway station to meet
them. If he showed himself a trifle
more careful than he had been lately
in his selection of a tie and in his
dress generally, and if anybody had
entered at the time and told him so,
George would probably have been
angry at the idea of his returning to
such weaknesses. There was Ned's
pleasant face at the window; there he
is waving his hat; and here he is now
introducing Miss Mary Fitzgerald to
his old friend, Mr. George Howard, to
the mutual astonishment and evident
confusion of that lady and gentleman,
who blushed and turned pale by
turns like guilty things. Even Ned
was dumfoundered a moment, and
argued to himself, from these silent
but unmistakable signs of recognition
between the parties, that his ceremony
of introduction was quite a
superfluous piece of etiquette.</p>

<p>He broke the awkward silence in
his characteristic fashion:</p>

<p>"Well, if you people know each
other already, you had better say so
at once, and not let me make an ass
of myself by going through a formal
introduction&mdash;a thing I always hate.
Mary, do you know George, or don't
you?"</p>

<p>There were tears in Mary's large
eyes, as, clinging a moment to her
brother, she sobbed rather than said:</p>

<p>"O Ned! this is the gentleman I
told you of, ... to whom I owe my
life, ... of whom we were all speaking...."
And then, turning the luminous
and still tearful eyes full on
George, who could scarcely stand up
against the rush of mingled feelings
that oppressed him, said, with a
genuine simplicity and native grace
which were most moving, as she took
his hand in her own with an action
at once gentle and natural: "Sir, it
was a bitter thought to me that I
should be compelled to leave France
without knowing and thanking the
brave gentleman who risked his life
to save mine. I had hoped to see
you at M. de Lorme's, and had so
much to say to you. But now that
I meet you," glancing at Ned, "in
this ... in this way, my heart is
so full I can say nothing...."
And the gathering tears began to fall.</p>

<p>It was time for Ned to intervene:</p>

<p>"Oho! So you are the unknown
knight whom M. de Lorme and the
ladies have been raving about; who
goes around in sable sadness, rescuing
charming young ladies from perilous
situations, and disappearing as mysteriously
as you come. Faith, my
friend, there is a nice romance concocted
over you. But, George, my
boy, I could say a great deal more
than my eloquent sister has done on
this subject, only I know it would be
distasteful to you. However, we shall
have it out together on the quiet some
day. But what a shame!" Ned rattled
on as they made their way to the
hotel. "Here is all my nice little plot
spoiled. Mary, I gave him such a description
of you. Let me see, George,
what was she like? Red-haired,
freckled, middle-aged, and stout;
short of breath and tall of body;
weighing one hundred and seventy
pounds after dinner, and a trifle less
before." George looked disgusted,
and Mary was laughing. "You
took snuff, Mary, and wore your carroty
curls in little whisks of brown
paper half through the day. You
had a vixenish temper, a liking for
toddy, and would insist on speaking
French to the servants with a beautiful
Galway accent, and swore at them
like a trooper for not understanding
you. It was only out of pure regard
for your handsome brother and for
the sake of 'auld lang syne' that
my friend George would tolerate your
presence at all. And here you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the whole time old and valued friends,
under mutual obligations to each
other&mdash;you for saving my middle-aged
relative from being run away with
and dashed to pieces by a vicious
brute, and my middle-aged relative
for being gracious enough to allow
you to do anything of the kind. I
declare it <em>is</em> shameful, and almost
makes one take the rash oath of never
telling a good-natured lie again."</p>

<p>This harangue of Ned's set them
both at their ease as though they had
known each other all their lives.</p>

<p>"And may I ask, Miss Fitzgerald,
if this conscientious brother of yours
gave an equally accurate description
of his old school-fellow?" said George,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Mary, don't tell.... He'll murder
me...."</p>

<p>"I was instructed all the way along
to be particularly kind and attentive
to a dapper...."</p>

<p>"No, not dapper ..." interjected
Ned.</p>

<p>"Yes, dapper, Mr. Howard; I remember
the word distinctly. A dapper
little old gentleman with a bald
head and only one eye, who was as
deaf as a post, but would not allow
any one to consider him so. I was
led to understand that he made excellent
company at table, only that he
simply followed out his own train of
thought, and his remarks consequently
were generally rather <em>mal-à-propos</em>;
and in fact quite a lot of other things
that I cannot remember, save that I
was to take him his drops every
morning at half-past eleven precisely,
and always put six lumps of
sugar in his coffee, and none in his
tea."</p>

<p>There was a merry dinner-party
that evening at the hotel, and a long
ramble by the beach afterwards under
the moon.</p>

<p>Mary had a great deal of Ned's
happy nature in her, and between the
two, what with sailing, and riding, and
long strolls, George could not well
help throwing off his despondency.
The light soon came back to the eye,
the color to the cheek, the spring to
the step, the gaiety to the young
heart, the belief that, after all, life was
not such a bad thing, and that there
were pleasant places even in this miserable
world for those who sought
them in the right spirit.</p>

<p>"Your friend George is getting
quite gay," remarked Mary one evening,
as brother and sister sat alone,
during the temporary absence of the
subject of that young lady's remark.</p>

<p>"Yes, poor fellow. He was in a
sad way when I dropped on him.
Going to the dev&mdash;I mean the grave,
fast."</p>

<p>"Why, what was the matter with
him?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't know. Put his foot
in it somehow."</p>

<p>"Put his foot in what?"</p>

<p>"In the wrong box, of course.
How stupid you women are!"</p>

<p>"But what wrong box, Ned?"</p>

<p>That gentleman looked ineffable
disgust at his beautiful sister, whose
eyes were fixed a little anxiously on
his. Then taking the peachy cheeks
between both hands, he drew her
face up to his own and kissed her,
saying, "There, Mary.... There
are only two women in the world to
whom I would do that.... You
are one&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the other?" asked Mary, a
little bewildered.</p>

<p>"Is to come," answered Ned enigmatically.
"It will take some time
perhaps to find her. One makes a
mistake sometimes among so many.
When he does, he puts his foot in the
wrong box."</p>

<p>"And you think he&mdash;that is, Mr.
Howard has quite recovered now?"
asked Mary, after a pause.</p>

<p>"Well, it looks as though he were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
very near it; but here he is to speak
for himself," said Ned, as George half
bounded into the room, flushed with
exercise, and looking as handsome as
any young lady could wish.</p>

<p>But why give the stages of what all
know so well and have heard thousands
of times told and retold? One
morning, some months after, the little
French town looked very gay. There
were green rushes strewn at the door
of the hotel, and all the towns-people
turned out in gala attire. There was
the carriage of M. de Lorme, and an
enormous bouquet in the coachman's
button-hole. There were more carriages,
and more coachmen, and
more bouquets. Soon the church was
filled with a buzzing and excited
crowd that hushed into silence as a
bridal party moved up the nave and
stood at the steps of the altar, whilst
the venerable <i lang="fr">curé</i> in the name of God
joined the hands together which no
power on earth may sunder. The
sunlight fell softly on them through
windows of pictured saints. Mme.
Plaquet was there, wiping her eyes,
and weeping silently, as she praised
the good God, who had saved the
<i lang="fr">pauvre garçon</i> and brought it all about
so wonderfully. M. Plaquet was
there, more convinced than ever that
his wife was a wonderful woman; for
had not she made the match? Old
women, and tender girls wept as the
sweet bride passed out a wife, amid
showers of blossoms strewn in her
path by little white-robed children.
They blessed her for an angel, and
her handsome husband, whom they
all knew so sad, and who now looked
so happy. There was another happy
face, with bright eyes and a sunny
smile, that attracted many an eye&mdash;the
face, the eyes, and the smile of
Mr. Edward Fitzgerald. If the reader
would know more of George's history,
it is being made. He has found
his true lady-love, and is proving himself
a true knight. Ned, gay Ned,
is as merry as ever. He is called
uncle now by a chubby-cheeked
youngster with sturdy legs and the
large eyes of his mother, into whose
innocent face his father often gazes
half anxiously, wondering will he ever
come to imitate him in his short-lived
folly. Ned has not put his foot in
the right box yet; so he says, but
rumor tells another tale. He may
meet us again some day.</p>

<h3>CRIME&mdash;ITS ORIGIN AND CURE.</h3>


<p>It is no exaggeration to say that
there is scarcely a man or woman in
the community who, upon taking up
a morning newspaper, is not prepared
to find recorded in its pages at least
one case of wilful murder or some
other atrocious infraction of the law,
human and divine. Whether it be
homicide or uxoricide, attempt at
either, or the criminal indulgence of
the baser passions; whether the result
of artificial excitement or the
wilful premeditation of bad or diseased
minds, the effect is the same on
the public, and the dreadfully frequent
recurrence of such offences&mdash;that
the lives of the most harmless
among us are put in jeopardy equally
with those of the most belligerent;
while the law, the first office of which
is to protect the life, honor, and
property of the citizen, is practically
ignored and defied.</p>

<p>This terrible prevalence of crime
has been a fruitful subject of comment,
and while the supineness of the
legal guardians of the general welfare
and the unaccountable stupidity or
weak sentimentality of jurymen have
been unsparingly denounced, very
little has been done in the way of
intelligent legislation to check the
ever-flowing stream of criminality.
It is true that the common and the
statute laws have long ago prescribed
death as the penalty for the commission
of murder, arson, treason, and
one or two other high crimes, long
terms of imprisonment in state-prisons
and penitentiaries for felonies, and
shorter terms in local prisons for
minor offences, but all these wise
enactments do not appear to check
the onward march of outrage and
lawlessness. The result is that
abroad the good name of the Republic
suffers, while at home the very
familiarity with deeds of violence
and dishonesty created by the sensational
and minute newspaper reports
is debasing the youth of the country,
and, by throwing a halo of romance
over their commission, robs them of
half their repulsive and disgusting
features.</p>

<p>Still, while much indignation and
more apprehension have been manifested
at the growth of crime and
the apathy and ignorance of those
entrusted with the duty of repressing
it, very little has been done either to
remove the causes which lead to its
perpetration, or to visit it with condign
punishment when all other
efforts have failed. This mere theorizing
over what is a tangible evil is
deeply to be deplored. Surely nothing
can be more worthy of the attention
of the statesman and the philanthropist
than the study and analysis
of this frightful social phenomenon,
with a view of limiting its growth,
even though it were found impossible
to lesson appreciably its present
gigantic proportions. It is well recognized
that it is the primary duty
of all civil governments to protect
the lives, liberties, and property of
their subjects, and our own national
and state organizations, clothed as
they are with such ample powers
and supported by popular approbation,
ought to be the foremost in discharging
this trust. Under arbitrary
or usurping governments, such as
those which dominate Poland, Ireland,
and Italy, it is generally difficult
to execute what is called the law, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the oppressed people are at enmity
with their oppressors, and take every
opportunity to oppose and thwart
what is styled the administration of
justice. They feel, and properly
feel, that "the world is not their
friend, nor the world's law;" but
with us it ought to be far different.
Here the laws are made by the people,
and it is understood for the people,
and hence every good citizen
should feel a personal interest in the
rectitude and exactitude of their administration.
He is not only injured
in person and property by imperfect
and ignorant legislation, through his
own carelessness, but he violates his
obligations to his fellow-man when
through neglect, or from unworthy
motives, he does not do all in his
power to prevent it.</p>

<p>However, to act intelligently as
well as conscientiously in matters of
such gravity, the study of the origin
of the evils which afflict and disgrace
our country, and the sources from
whence they generally spring, requires
more attention than has usually
been given, even by those who
most deplore their existence. It will
not do to throw down your newspaper
after perusing accounts of
three or four cases of murder, and
ask to what is the world coming?
It is almost equally useless to occasionally
hang a criminal, or to send
another to prison for life. For the
one so punished, a score at least escape,
and the demands neither of
retributive nor distributive justice are
satisfied. The evil-disposed gratify
their revenge by the commission of
these crimes, while their chances of
punishment are no more than one
in twenty. Thus the plague that infests
society daily becomes more
noxious and, as it were, epidemic.</p>

<p>Crime has its latitude and longitude,
its nationality, classes, and
castes, its peculiar inciting causes, as
well as the great vital cause&mdash;the
absence of true religious faith and
practice. For instance, it might
be easily demonstrated that the
many-nationed people of the United
States are addicted to special classes
of crime, as distinct and almost as
obvious as their language, habits, and
intellectual idiosyncrasies. We speak
now of the more flagrant violations
of the social compact, not with the
intention of discriminating against
any class or race in the community,
nor with the object of holding
the mass of any people, no matter
what their origin or country, responsible
for the acts of a few among
them&mdash;for after all the criminals are
in a small minority, fortunately,
among all nations&mdash;but to point out
the nature and peculiar motives for
the commission of offences against
the law as they exist among different
classes of our population, so that
suitable remedies may be applied to
the respective cases.</p>

<p>Outrages against law and justice
depend to a certain extent on locality
for their distinctive character.
The desperate hand-to-hand encounters
which have so long characterized
a certain class of society in
the border states, are as different in
motive from that of the cool Connecticut
poisoner, as the assassin of our
aristocratic circles is dissimilar to the
ruffian of the slums.</p>

<p>When we ascribe homicide to the
criminal classes of America, we do
not assume it to be a national sin,
for though of late we have read of
some cases in New England and the
West, and know of many deliberate
ones in this vicinity, we refer specially
in our analysis to the remote
Southern and Southwestern states,
where the bowie-knife, the rifle, and
the revolver are considered much
more efficacious and prompt in the
settlement of disputes than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
slower and less exciting appeal to
the courts. It may be said that this
is the natural consequence of the
war, the termination of which has
thrown out of employment many
desperate men habituated to the use
of arms; but this is only partially
true, for the same state of society existed
in New Orleans, Arkansas, and
along the banks of the Mississippi
many years anterior to the late internecine
contest. Lawless men of
every grade, gamblers, horse-thieves,
the idle, and the debauched, have for
nearly two generations infested those
and neighboring localities; deadly
quarrels were constantly springing
up, and were decided in a moment
by the death of one if not of both
disputants; and the public authorities,
whenever they dared to interfere, were
sure to be set at defiance, if not maltreated.
The same state of affairs
exists to this day, but in a modified
form, and there seems to have been
no way discovered to alter it.</p>

<p>Still, the American people as a
whole are not responsible for what
might be called a local disorganization
of society, grown out of their
rapidly-extending settlements, whence
flock naturally many outcasts, vagabonds,
and reckless men, anxious to
escape the odium of public opinion
and the chastisement that awaited
them in the older and more thickly
settled communities of the East. But
our country, with a better show of
reason, may be accused of condoning,
if not of actually encouraging, a
widespread system of political and
commercial dishonesty, an offence
which, though not by any means as
bad as the taking of human life in
its direct consequences, indirectly encourages
and promotes the commission
of the greater crime. A legislator
or a judge who can be guilty of
taking bribes, is sure, the one to
make bad laws and the other to
execute good ones corruptly. Criminals
who have political or moneyed
influence are allowed to escape with
impunity, with a <i lang="fr">carte blanche</i> to continue
their nefarious business. Whoever
has read the proceedings of the
several investigating committees in
Washington during the last session
of Congress, and of our State Senate
acting as a court of impeachment during
the summer of 1872, will hardly
doubt the truth of this assertion.</p>

<p>This spirit of bribery, false swearing
and peculation we find prevailing,
among some of the most prominent
members of the national Congress,
who, these investigations have
shown, are not above the acceptance
of paltry bribes for the use or abuse
of their high delegated authority;
we find it in many of our state legislatures,
particularly when a United
States senator is to be elected or the
interest of a railroad company, a corporation,
or a wealthy private individual
is to be subserved by forcing
or retarding legislation; and it
is a matter of public notoriety that
among the officers of municipal corporations,
notably our own, where
integrity, if in any place, should find
a home, the most unblushing robbery,
swindling, and false swearing have
prevailed for years. Again, let us
look at the history of our large
banks and insurance companies.
There is scarcely a week passes but
we hear of defaulting officers and
clerks who, after years of secret, continuous
stealing and false entries,
finally decamp, leaving it to be discovered
that the aggregate amount
of their individual abstractions reaches
tens and hundreds of thousands.
What makes this "respectable" species
of larceny so heartless and reprehensible
is, that the money so
stolen does not actually belong to
the institutions themselves, but to
the public, and generally the poorer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
classes, who are depositors or policyholders.
It is significant that in
proportion to the number of counting-houses
superintended by their
owners to the number of banks and
insurance companies the trust-funds of
which are in keeping of paid officials,
the number of defalcations in the
former are as a mere nothing compared
with those of the latter. Why?
In one case, the merchant is liable to
lose his own money by negligence;
in the other, the president and directors
lose only that of other people,
and thus a criminal betrayal of trust
is added to swindling.</p>

<p>Now, these blots on the national
escutcheon are of comparatively recent
date, and are the result mainly
of two causes: the late war, which
suddenly elevated an ignorant and
ignoble class to enormous wealth,
and the corruption of politics and
politicians by the unguarded and
unchecked abuse of universal suffrage.
The shoddyites and the politicians,
having no claim on the
respect or esteem of honest men,
commenced a career of extravagance
and vulgar display, which, if it did
not win the approbation of the judicious
and refined, certainly was well
calculated to dazzle the moral vision
of the vain and unstable. Palaces,
diamonds, and resplendent equipages
became the order of the day, and
their effect on the integrity of the
staid men of business was marked and
deleterious in the highest degree.
Mrs. A., whose husband before the
war was doing a thriving little business
and was content with an occasional
drive in a hired light-wagon,
now enjoyed the luxury of a private
carriage and liveried servants; consequently
Mrs. B., whose husband was
cashier in a bank at two or three
thousand a year, must have one similar.
Mr. C., who was a resident of
the Sixth or Seventh Ward previous to
his election to office, and occupied
part of a comfortable house, now
lived in a handsome mansion on
Madison or Fifth avenues; hence
Mr. D., who was confidential clerk
in a large importing house, abandoned
his cosy cottage in the suburbs
and followed his old friend's example.
Now, how are B. and D. to support
this luxury? Clearly, not out of
their salaries. Having control of the
funds and enjoying the confidence
of their employers, they abstract the
money and rush into Wall or New
Streets to gamble in gold or stocks.
They are not common thieves&mdash;oh!
no; they only borrowed from time
to time large sums of cash from the
true owners, intending to return it;
but they never do so! For a short
time they are lucky, and are able to
keep place in a course of wild dissipation
with A. and C., but sooner or
later a crisis arrives, there is "a panic
in the street," and they lose all.
Then follow flight, detection, and
public exposure&mdash;in any well-regulated
community, we might add dishonor.
But it is not so; for, you see,
this is the age of progress and enlightenment.
The public think very
lightly of such matters, probably
from their very frequency, and soon
forget them; the "knowing ones"
condemn the fugitives only for not
having been "smart" enough; the
bank or insurance authorities compromise
the felony for a consideration,
for it is only the public, not
themselves personally, who have suffered;
and, after a brief sojourn in Europe
or Canada, the criminals return
to the bosom of their families prepared
to enter on some new field of
peculation.</p>

<p>As for the political rogues, no one
seems to heed their depredations.
Public opinion has become so vitiated
that it is expected every man in office
will steal; in fact, some persons go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
so far as to say they ought to steal,
holding it a trivial affair to appropriate
large amounts of the people's
money, while they would hesitate long
before advising any one to rob a till
or strip a clothes-line. We recollect
an official in this city who for a
wonder was so honest that he was
poorer when he resigned than when
he accepted office. Upon being
met on an occasion by a friend and
congratulated on having been able
to purchase one of the largest hotels
in New York out of the "spoils," the
gentleman indignantly resented the
insult in no measured terms. His
acquaintance laughed quietly, and
walked away with an expression of
mingled pity and contempt on his
countenance.</p>

<p>Now this lust for gain, this inordinate
love of display, which leads the
inexperienced and weak-minded into
so many unworthy actions, should be
abated, if we hope to preserve anything
like commercial honor and
political purity. They are eating
into the very vitals of society, infecting
the very highest as well as the
lowest class in the community; and
though the consequences to which
they lead may not appear so heinous
as other crimes, they are so far-reaching
and so general that they might
well be classed with those to which
the law attaches its severest penalties.
There was a time, not very far distant,
when the idea of attempting to bribe
a senator, or what is called "buying
up" a state legislature, would have
been considered preposterous, and
when the counting-house and the
banker's desk were considered the
temple and altar, as it were, of
honesty and integrity. Why is it
that so lamentable a change has
taken place, and in so short a time?
Clearly, because an insatiate longing
for the acquisition of wealth, speedily
and with as little labor as possible,
has taken possession of the present
generation, and in a headlong pursuit
of fortune, honor, reputation, and
conscience are too often cast aside
and forgotten. This should not be
so in a country like ours of unlimited
resources, and where industry and
ability need never look in vain for a
competency.</p>

<p>But a more diabolical crime against
all law, natural, human, and divine,
is the system, so prevalent in some
sections of this country, of mothers
depriving their inchoate offspring of
existence even on the very threshold
of their entrance into the world.
So unnatural is this offence that it
is beyond the power of language
to reprobate it adequately, and in
charity we hope that the guilty
votaries of ease and fashion, who
perpetrate such horrible atrocities, do
not realize the full turpitude of their
acts. We had long refused to believe
that such a violation, not only of
God's law, but of the strongest and
most beautiful instincts of our nature&mdash;the
parent's love for her child&mdash;existed
to any great extent, but we have
been so often assured of it by
physicians and other reputable persons
conversant with such matters,
that we have been forced to admit
as true the existence among us of a
crime that would disgrace the veriest
savage. We are assured that in
certain localities, which we shall not
particularize, the evil is not only
widespread but is growing into a
custom, and this extraordinary fact
is adduced as one of the reasons why
the children of native-born parents
are so few in proportion to those of
foreigners. If we were to look for
a primary cause for such barbaric
criminality in merely human motives,
we should fail to find one at all
commensurate with the enormity of
the guilt. The wish of married women
to be freed from the care of young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
children, so that they, being unincumbered
by household duties and cares,
may participate in outdoor pleasures,
attend the opera, the theatres, concerts,
and ball-rooms, has been advanced
with some force as one of
the reasons; but this is not sufficient,
for we find the heinous practice
prevailing in remote towns and villages
where no such attractions are
presented. The laws of civil marriage
and of divorce, as recognized
in most of the states of the Union;
that curse of what is called modern
civilization; that fatal legacy handed
down to us by the "Reformers," has
much to answer for in this respect.
Protestantism has reduced the holy
sacramental bond of matrimony
beneath the level of a limited co-partnership,
degraded the nuptial
contract below the most trivial
commercial obligation, annihilated
its responsibilities, destroyed its safeguards,
and even wishes to go further&mdash;to
ignore the very shadow of marriage,
from which it has long since
taken the substance. The purchase
of a piece of land or the delivery of
a bale of goods is now attended with
more ceremony than that sacred rite
at which our Saviour himself attended
in Galilee and at which he performed
his first miracle! How deeply has
humanity been made to suffer for the
bestiality of Henry Tudor and the
apostasy of the monk of Augsburg!
Is it any wonder then that a link,
so thoughtlessly accepted and so
lightly worn, should be as unceremoniously
sundered, and that the
woman, who does not know but
on the morrow she may be either
plaintiff or defendant in a divorce
suit, should be adverse to bringing
into the world children which either
parent may claim or disown?</p>

<p>But the grand motive cause is to
be found still deeper. If the truth
must be told, the masses of the people
of this noble country are fast
sinking into intellectual paganism,
beside which that of imperial Rome
was harmless and innocuous. Protestantism,
as has often been predicted,
has nearly reached its logical
conclusion&mdash;infidelity. Read the
sermons of the prominent sensational
preachers, their newspapers and periodicals,
and what do you find in
them? No stern lessons of Christian
morality; no appeals to the
moral conscience or exposition of
the beauties of the cardinal virtues;
no dogma, as befits heaven-appointed
guides; no doctrine such as only
the ordained of God can preach and
teach; but, instead, stale tirades
against Catholicity, rehashed lyceum
lectures, and fragments of stump-speeches
delivered before the last
election and interlarded with pious
ejaculations to suit the occasion,
apologies for being Christians at all,
and occasional efforts to explain
away Christianity itself&mdash;all covered
over with a thin veil of cant and
mock philanthropy.</p>

<p>Do we find these so-called ministers
telling their congregations that
marriage is an indissoluble tie, which
no man can burst asunder; that the
object of it is to enable husband and
wife to live together happily and to
bring up their children in the love
and fear of God; that to take the
life of an infant ante-natal is a dark,
deadly, mortal sin; that no living human
being who has not received
baptism can ever see the face of God;
and that whoever wilfully deprives
her helpless babe of that ineffable
delight will have to account for that
lost soul to its Maker? Oh! no;
that might shock the sensibilities of
their audiences, and might lead to
their own expulsion from their livings.
Is it surprising, then, that a vice so
much in harmony with the working
of human passions, as apparently de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>void
of all moral responsibility as it
is free from civil punishment, should
be so frequently and so freely indulged
in by those whose base inclinations
are unchecked and unregulated
by anything like true Christian teaching?</p>

<p>But what most surprises us is the
appearance in the public prints for
the past two or three years of numerous
cases of suicide. This "self-slaughter"
was a crime, we thought,
confined to the older nations of Europe
almost exclusively. The Americans
are neither a despondent, an
impoverished, nor a sentimental people;
and yet we have been exceedingly
pained to read of men well-to-do
in the world, many of them being
comfortable farmers and most of
them advanced in years, deliberately
taking that life which God
gave them for wise and useful purposes,
and voluntarily going before the
judgment-seat of their Maker with
the crime of murder on their souls.
The policy of the old common law
was to consider every suicide insane,
but that was merely a fiction to save
his goods from confiscation by the
crown; we would fain believe that
the numerous instances among ourselves
were the result of aberration
of mind&mdash;doubtless some of them
were; but others have been planned
and executed with such forethought
as to preclude the possibility of such
a supposition. As we write, we have
before us a copy of a New York
journal in which no less than four
suicides of Americans in various
parts of the country are recorded.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>It has been debated whether the
act of a suicide is, humanly speaking,
one of courage or cowardice: we
are inclined to the latter opinion, but
the question is immaterial. Whatever
be its character in that respect,
it is sure to originate in the absence
of any belief which affirms a hereafter,
or in that morbid form of
idiocy known as spiritualism, which
runs into the other extreme. In
either case, it can only be prevented
by moral suasion, for the civil
law is of course utterly powerless in
the matter; yet of all known crimes
it is the most seductive, and even
might be called contagious.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to another class
of our people&mdash;the adopted citizens,
and consider the peculiarities of their
criminal classes. The largest proportion
of our immigrant population
is from Ireland, and, coming from
a misgoverned and plundered land,
many of them, indeed we think a
large majority, are very poor indeed,
so destitute that they have not means
to bring them to the West, or into
the rural districts, and consequently
remain in the large cities for life.
We have observed that deeds of
violence committed by a certain
class of Irish-Americans are disproportionately
large, when compared
with the native population or with
those of other countries. We regret
to be obliged to say so.</p>

<p>We yield to none in our respect,
nay affection, for the children of long-suffering
and persecuted Ireland, but
we would be untrue to ourselves and
unjust to the bulk of our fellow-citizens
of Irish birth were we to ignore
or deny that but too many of them
allow themselves to be led into the
commission of acts of violence not
unfrequently ending in deadly quarrel.</p>

<p>This should not be. As a rule, an
Irishman is social, humorous, and
kind, affectionate in his family relations
and disinterested in his friendships.
In this country he has all
the advantages that religion can
afford, the churches are open to him
every day, he is not restricted in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
attendance at divine service on Sundays,
he has always, particularly in
cities and large towns, an opportunity
of hearing good, practical, and instructive
sermons and discourses on
the duties of life, at least once a
week; and the strength to resist temptation,
which the sacraments alone
can give, is always within his power
to obtain.</p>

<p>Whence, then, originates this ungovernable
passion, this desperate
recklessness that resists all control,
and, disregarding consequences, rushes
madly into sin, makes man an
outlaw among his fellows, and drags
him to the dungeon and the scaffold?
We must not attribute it to
his defective education, the result of
a jealous and tyrannical system of
government in his native country,
though it may have something to do
with it; neither will the fact that
many who had golden dreams before
they reached our shores failed to
realize them, and so became heedless.
Poverty and destitution have been
pleaded in extenuation, but they are
more a result than a cause; for no
able-bodied man, if well-conducted,
need be in that sense either poor or
destitute in this country, where labor
is ever in demand. No; the secret,
if it be a secret, lies in one word&mdash;intoxication,
and, as a consequence, in
the neglect of the religious duties
taught and performed in their younger
days. Intoxication is the demon
that creeps into their souls, fires their
heated blood, plunges his victims into
an abyss of crime and transforms
man, the noblest work of the Creator,
into a ferocious brute. We are aware
that instances of forgery, arson,
swindling, and premeditated homicide&mdash;in
fact, all offences requiring
skill and deliberation&mdash;are exceedingly
rare among our Irish-born population,
but that is no reason why a
few men born and baptized in the
church, as little children taught the
great truths of religion in the simple
words of the catechism, and as adults
weekly and almost daily within
reach of moral instruction and a participation
in the benefits of the sacraments,
should by their neglect of
religion, and their insane desire for
deleterious stimulants, disgrace the
race from which they have sprung
and bring obloquy on the religion they
profess to respect, but never practise.
Who ever heard of an Irish
adopted citizen, a teetotaler or even
a uniformly temperate man, committing
an atrocious crime or a deliberate
breach of the laws of his adopted
country?</p>

<p>No better illustration can be given
of the beneficial effects of temperance
on the Irish character than the following
official statistics taken from
the <cite>Life of Father Mathew</cite>. The author
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"As a conclusive proof that the diminution
of crime [in Ireland] was one of the
necessary consequences of the spread of
temperance among those classes of the
community most liable to be tempted to
acts of violence or dishonesty, some few
facts from the official records of the time
may be quoted here. They are taken
from the returns of 'outrages specially reported
by the constabulary,' from the year
1837 to the year 1841, both included.
The number of homicides, which was 247
in 1838, was only 105 in 1841. There
were 91 cases of 'firing at the person' in
1837 and but 66 in 1841. The 'assaults
on police' were 91 in 1837 and but 58 in
1841. Incendiary fires, which were as
many as 459 in 1838, were 390 in 1841.
Robberies, thus specially reported, diminished
wonderfully from 725 in 1837 to
257 in 1841! The offence of 'killing, cutting,
or maiming cattle' was also seriously
lessened; the cases reported in 1839
being 433, to 213 in 1841! The decrease
in cases of 'robbery of arms' was most
significant; from being 246 in 1837 there
were but 111 in 1841. The offence of
'appearing in arms' showed a favorable
diminution, falling from 110 in 1837 to
66 in 1841. The effect of sobriety on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
'faction fights' was equally remarkable.
There were 20 of such cases in 1839 and
8 in 1841. The dangerous offence of
'rescuing prisoners,' which was represented
by 34 in 1837, had no return in
1841.</p>

<p>"Without entering further into details,
the following returns of the number committed
during a period of seven years,
from 1839 to 1845, must bring conviction
home to the mind of any rational and
dispassionate person that sobriety is good
for the individual and the community:</p></div>

<p>"The figures already quoted are most
valuable, as they prove, beyond the possibility

a greater enemy of the Irish race
than even her hereditary foe, England.</p>

<p>With the Germans it is different.
They are by no means given to
indulgence in violent stimulants,
though they, too, are a social people,
fond of enjoyment and of their national
beverage, beer; yet crime, and
that of a very serious character, is
not unusual among them, particularly
the killing of females. And
here again we have the evidence of
the terrible havoc which the great
rebellion of the XVIth century
against the church and her authority
has wrought in the social relations
of mankind. Germany was the originator,
the centre, and the main supporter
of that revolt on the Continent
of Europe, and, having been
violently wrested from the seat of
Catholic unity, has ever since been
groping in the dark, oscillating between
heathenism and transcendentalism,
without stability or any sort
of fixed principles. The blight of
the Reformation, so called, has eaten
into the very marrow of their family
relations, and what would be deemed
infamous for women of other
countries to do, is considered among
a certain class of this people, limited,
it is true, a matter of course.</p>

<p>Once again, let us not be misunderstood.
In ascribing this species
of offence to the Germans in the
United States, we do not mean to
say that it is general to the whole
body; on the contrary, we are happy
to know that it is confined to a few,
for, as a whole, the people from the
north of Europe are perhaps the
most law-abiding portion of our citizens.
We are well aware that in
this city, and in the West and South,
there are many learned professors,
devoted priests, and devout congregations,
all of German birth, as well
as many reputable merchants, mechanics,
and professional men of the
same nationality, who worship God
according to their hereditary cus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>toms;
but we think we do not go too
far in saying that the majority of
German-Americans have practically
no religion, that they never enter a
church, say a prayer, or perform any
of the ordinary duties of a Christian.
Some years ago, the writer was introduced
into a Germania society in
a neighboring city which consisted
of over three hundred members, all
gentlemen of education and wealth.
He subsequently visited it three or
four times on various Sundays, and
always found its spacious suite of
rooms crowded. Upon enquiring
where those persons went to church,
his friend placidly replied: "I don't
think there is one of us ever goes to
church; you know I do not." If
such an example is set by the "higher
classes," what can we expect from
those in the lower scale of social
life?</p>

<p>We often have had occasion to
admire the way in which the Germans
enjoy themselves on week-days
and Sundays; the order and good-fellowship
which prevail at their
gatherings, their songs and instrumental
music, and the fact that they
always bring with them their wives
and children to partake of their enjoyment.
But our satisfaction at
seeing them go to the rural retreats
on a Sunday morning, and return
peaceably in the evening after a
long day of rational pleasure, has
been considerably lessened by the
knowledge that no portion of the
day, set apart as a day of prayer as
well as of rest, has been devoted by
those pleasure-seekers to the service
of the great Giver of all blessings, of
happiness here and hereafter. Such
practical defiance of God's law, such
ingratitude towards our common Father,
such complete disregard of the
simplest requirements of religion,
must necessarily blunt the moral
sense, more especially as it affects
and weakens the sanctified tie that
binds husband and wife. It is therefore
with more sorrow than surprise that
we read of so many cases among
our German fellow-citizens of men
and women living with other persons'
wives and husbands. Such
conditions are unlawful and short-lived,
the fruitful source of anger,
jealousy, and discontent, and not unusually
culminate in ill-treatment,
blows, and even death.</p>

<p>While we also ascribe the crime of
the destruction of offspring to the
Germans, we do not mean to say
that it is practised to any extent
among them, but that the foul crime
is perpetrated in this and other large
cities almost exclusively by German
quack doctors, male and female;
their victims being generally from
other nationalities. For this the
German people are not so much to
blame as our own press, which publishes
the advertisements of those
miscreants and scatters them broadcast
on the world for a paltry consideration;
and our state legislatures,
which have neglected until lately to
enact proper laws; and our prosecuting
attorneys, who have failed to
enforce such enactments as we have
on our statute-books against this class
of rank murderers.</p>

<p>Offences against property are almost
exclusively in the hands of our
English criminals, if we except the
horse-stealing of the Southwest. Our
most expert pickpockets, our most
dexterous sneak-thieves, daring highwaymen,
and scientific burglars come
from London, many of whom have
served her Majesty for a term of
years in her penal colonies, and are
so well known to the detectives of
the British metropolis that they have
sought new fields of enterprise in this
country. They have been preceded
or accompanied by prize-fighters,
gamblers, and keepers of low dens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
called concert-saloons. The former
they make the partners in their labors
and gains, and in the latter hot-beds
of infamy they find shelter and concealment.
It may be said that this
class of crimes is far less reprehensible
than those above enumerated,
and so they would be were it not
that highway robbery and burglary
sometimes terminate in the taking
of human life. Still, it must be said
in justice that we hear of very few
cases of wilful homicide being perpetrated
by the English among us,
though, like the French, suicide is
not unknown to them, but arises
from different causes. The Briton
"shuffles off this mortal coil" through
moroseness and despondency; the
Gaul gaily prepares to smother
himself with carbonic acid gas from
a morbid sentimentality, and a contempt
for the precious gift of life
which he is about to throw away.</p>

<p>Now, if all these offences were
simply infractions of the municipal
law, we would naturally look to our
legislatures, our courts, juries, and
sheriffs for their prevention or punishment,
but they are not only that, but
breaches of the divine law, and we
must depend likewise on the efficacy
of moral suasion to prevent if not
to correct them. Public opinion can
do much to repress crime, the legislative,
administrative, and judicial
branches of our various local governments,
each in its sphere, might effect
far more good; but it is on the teachings
of true Christianity alone, and
all the consequences that flow from
it, that we must rely if we wish to
stem the tide of misery, vice, and
outrage which are fast surging over
every portion of our fair land.
The strong arm of the civil power is
potent to punish when the crime has
been committed, but weak indeed to
prevent its perpetration. This higher
and nobler duty is reserved for religion,
and for religion alone. It is
well enough to make concise and
exact punitive laws, though this is
not always done; and to administer
them fearlessly, honestly, and intelligently,
though the reverse is generally
the case; still, experience has
taught us that wise enactments and
impartial judges have very little
power to stay the promptings of bad
hearts or repress the temptations
ever presenting themselves to men
of vicious habits or defective moral
training. The church, and only the
church, can rule the mind and heart
of man, can train him from his
infancy, before he knows or is responsible
to any civil law, can
strengthen him with the graces of the
sacraments, arm him with the most
potent of all weapons against sin&mdash;prayer&mdash;place
constantly before his
eyes the certainty of everlasting bliss
or eternal damnation, keep him in
the "narrow path," and thus prevent
the possibility of his being an enemy
to society and an outcast of heaven.</p>

<p>Next to the church comes the
school. The importance of education
to the well-being of society can
never be overstated. It may be well
said that it is in the school-room the
seeds of vice or virtue are first sown,
it is there that the future benefactor
or the enemy of his kind commences
his career in life, and it is upon the
proper or vicious method of teaching
which he receives as a boy depends
mainly his future course in the world.
No wonder, then, that the Catholic
Church is so desirous of superintending
the training of those little ones
who by the sacrament of baptism
have been made children of God and
heirs to the kingdom of heaven; that
the zealous parish priest should
mourn over the loss of hundreds
of the youth of his congregation,
who, taught in Protestant or infidel
schools, have fallen away from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
faith to plunge into sin and vice. Is
he to be blamed if he exhausts every
resource and strains every nerve to
establish for his people a school
where their offspring will be guarded
from worldly contamination, and
trained in all the beautiful morality
of Catholic doctrine? Few seem to
understand the comprehensive meaning
of the word education. The
mere acquisition of worldly knowledge
is not education, the development
of the highest intellectual powers
is not education, but only a part,
and a secondary part at that, of a
complete education; for without inculcating
morality, justice, a high
sense of honor, a noble disregard for
self, and a sympathy for the suffering
and unfortunate, you curse man with
a disposition that is its own Nemesis,
with unlawful desires that "make the
food they feed on," and simply enlarge
his capacity for doing evil.</p>

<p>That this is the result of our present
common-school system cannot
well be gainsaid in view of the general
spirit of peculation and corruption
which prevails in those very portions
of the country where such
schools are most numerous and best
attended and supported. And this
view is not ours alone. Already we
find the secular press, hitherto the
strongest opponents of denominational
education, clamoring for a reform
in our method of public instruction.
"We must have," says a leading
daily paper of this city, "a higher
system of morals taught in our public
schools"; though the writer does
not condescend to say how morals
can be taught without religion, or
who are to be the teachers. Is it the
fagged-out teacher who tries to earn
his salary by the least possible labor,
and who perhaps, in this respect, is
as deficient as the children themselves;
or is it the trained priest or
the lowly Christian Brother, who has
devoted himself heart and soul to
the service of God and of his creatures,
and whose reward is not of this
world?</p>

<p>Our common schools, with some
modifications, are decidedly a New
England invention, but none the
worse for that, for the early settlers of
that much-abused region, whatever
may have been their other faults,
were neither an irreligious nor an
immoral people. On the contrary
they were deeply imbued with a
sense of the dignity of religion and a
reverence for its ministers, according
to their limited and erroneous but
honestly entertained ideas; and being
all of one way of thinking, they
established schools, at the public expense
it is true, but they took care
that their peculiar theological notions
should go hand-in-hand with
secular teaching. The minister, the
elder, or the deacon generally united
with his clerical office that of
schoolmaster, and the morals as well
as the intellectual qualities of the
pupils were sedulously developed and
cultivated. Now all this is changed.
The foundation upon which the
public-school system was built has
crumbled into dust, and the superstructure
cannot and ought not to
stand longer. Our country is now
composed of many nationalities, believing
in various creeds, and the
task of educating the rising generation
should be remitted to each denomination
to take care of and instruct
its own members. If we want
to inculcate true lessons of morality
and integrity, to stop bribery, forgery,
perjury, dishonesty, infanticide, and
homicide, we must change our system
of education, or it is possible
that society, laboring under so heavy
a burden of sin and dishonor, will
in the near future be crushed to
pieces.</p>

<p>But for the adult immigrants who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
have never felt the baleful influence
of our public schools, what is
the remedy? For the Germans we
would say, a more general attendance
at divine service. They are pre-eminently
an organizing people: why
do not those good German Catholics
who are so constant in their devotions
establish more societies, with a view
to induce their erring compatriots to
give up at least a portion of that time
now wholly devoted to pleasure to
the worship of God? This would be
a work of great charity, and if earnestly
undertaken would doubtless
be successful. The panacea that lies
before our Irish fellow-citizens is temperance&mdash;that
observed, we venture to
say that they will be found among the
most moral and orderly portion of our
population. In this connection we
are glad to observe the untiring energy
exhibited by prominent laymen
to organize and unite temperance societies,
and the encouragement given
them by priests and bishops. Our
Irish friends must not forget that not
only the honor of their native land
and the prosperity of their children
in that of their adoption depend on
their good conduct and sobriety, but
that, to a great extent, the Catholic
Church in America is contemned or
revered in proportion as they act
against or in harmony with her doctrine
and discipline. If woe be denounced
against whosoever gives
scandal, a blessing is also promised
to those who, by their actions, glorify
the name of God.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />

LOUIS IS DISMISSED.</h4>

<p>Such, then, was the state of affairs
when Louis, after an absence of ten
days, returned to his usual occupation.
The evening was somewhat
advanced when he arrived. Mr.
Smithson, who was not in the habit
of doing anything hastily, thought it
better to defer the interview till the
following day. The order to the
porter was therefore countermanded,
and a servant sent to inform Louis
that Mr. Smithson wished to see him
the next morning. Louis was quite
startled at receiving so unexpected a
summons.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" he said to
himself. "Can Mr. Smithson be
displeased at my long absence?...
Has he heard of Adams' intended
conversion?... Perhaps Albert
has obtained my dismissal." There
was nothing cheering whichever way
he turned. He therefore passed a
restless night. Fortunately, he had
a support that was once wanting:
he trusted in God, and could pray.
Prayer does not remove our fears,
but it calms them. Besides, whatever
misfortune threatens the Christian,
he feels it will never befall him
unless it is the will of God. However
rude the blow, it is even changed
into a blessing to him that turns
with confidence to the Hand that
chastens. God is ever merciful, especially
toward those who truly hope
in him.</p>

<p>Eugénie, better informed than
Louis as to what had taken place,
but less pious, was at that very hour
tormented by a thousand apprehensions
really justified by the circumstances.
She saw the storm approaching,
and was sure it would
overwhelm the one she loved. But
what could she do? She had already
got into trouble by undertaking his
defence. She could only await in silence
the result which was at hand.
Then, perhaps, she could decide on
something, or wait still longer before
deciding. Thwarted affection more
than any other sentiment in the
world relies on the help of time.</p>

<p>The next morning, Louis went to
Mr. Smithson's office at the appointed
hour. They had not had a special
interview for a long time. Louis
appeared as he usually did at that
period&mdash;easy in his manners, but
cold and taciturn. Mr. Smithson,
on his side, had recovered his usual
calmness. He ceremoniously offered
the engineer a chair, and thus began
the conversation:</p>

<p>"Monsieur, I have thought it
proper to have an immediate explanation
with you. Your long absence
has been unfortunate on many accounts.
Moreover, a fact has recently
come to my knowledge, or rather,
a series of facts which have occurred
in my manufactory, by no means
agreeable to me."</p>

<p>"I acknowledge, sir," replied Louis,
"that my absence was long&mdash;much
longer than I could have wished.
But you would regard the motives
that kept me away from the mill as a
sufficient excuse, if you knew them."</p>

<p>"I am already aware of them,
monsieur, and admit that they were
reasonable. But as you had a sufficient
excuse for absenting yourself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
you did wrong not to communicate
it before leaving."</p>

<p>"It would have been better to do
so, I acknowledge; but I was sent
for in haste, and obliged to leave
without any other notice than a note.
I have since been so absorbed in
care as to hinder me from thinking
of anything else."</p>

<p>"Very well, monsieur, we will say
no more about that. There remains
the other occurrence that has vexed
me. You have excited religious doubts
in the mind of a poor fellow of my
own belief who is young and inexperienced&mdash;considerations
that should
have checked your propensity to
make proselytes."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir, if I beg leave to
correct an inexactness&mdash;quite involuntary,
I am sure, but a serious one&mdash;in
the expressions you have just
made use of. I made no effort to
induce this man to abandon his religion.
He first came to me, and
said...."</p>

<p>"What he said was prompted by
certain things in your evening instructions.
You dwell on the necessity
of the Catholic faith; you infuse
doubts in the minds of the workmen
who do not partake of your
convictions."</p>

<p>"I have never directly attacked
any religion."</p>

<p>"Your indirect attacks are more
dangerous."</p>

<p>"What could I do?"</p>

<p>"Your course was all marked out
beforehand. Employed in an establishment
the head of which belongs
to a different faith from yours; exercising
an influence perhaps beneficial
to the workmen by means of
your evening-school, your library,
and your visits to their houses, but
exercising this influence in my name
and under my auspices, you ought
not to have allowed yourself to wander
off to religious subjects."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir, I did not and
could not. Have the goodness to
listen to my reasons. Morality without
religion is, in my opinion, merely
Utopian. That the Anglican religion
sanctions morality I do not deny.
Nor can you deny that it is supported
in a most wonderful manner
by the Catholic Church&mdash;indeed, my
conscience obliges me to say the
faith is its most efficient support.
In talking to the workmen, who are
nearly all Catholics, I give them
moral instructions in the name of
the belief they practise, or ought to
practise."</p>

<p>"That was a grave error, as it
soon proved. In consequence of
your imprudent course, a weak-minded
man was led to the point of
changing his religion. As I am of
the same faith, this was an insult to
me. Such a thing could not occur in
my establishment without my consent,
and it was inadmissible. If
Adams had persisted, I should have
discharged him. Toleration has its
limits."</p>

<p>"Ah! he has not persisted?"</p>

<p>"No; his fears were imaginary,
and only needed calming. I have used
no other means of leading him back
but persuasion. Friendly reasoning
brought him back to the point where
he was a month ago. Nevertheless,
I do not wish a similar occurrence
to take place. We must decide on
the course you have got to pursue.
My wishes may be summed up thus:
either you must give up attempting
to exercise any influence over my
workmen, apart from your official duties,
or you must bind yourself by
a promise never to touch on religious
subjects before them, either in
public or in private."</p>

<p>"Does this prohibition apply
equally to the Catholic workmen
and those of other religions?"</p>

<p>"To all indiscriminately. I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
say to you, with my habitual frankness,
that you manifest a zeal for
proselyting that displeases me and
excites my fears."</p>

<p>"What fears, monsieur?"</p>

<p>"I fear that, knowingly or unknowingly,
you are the agent of the
priests. They always seek, I know,
to insinuate themselves everywhere,
and to rule everywhere. I will not
tolerate it on my premises."</p>

<p>"You have a wrong idea of the
Catholic priesthood, monsieur. The
love of power imputed to the clergy
it would be difficult to prove. I am
not their agent, for the reason that
they have no agents. If I desire to
do some good to those around me,
this wish is inspired by the Gospel,
which teaches us in many places to
do all the good we can. Now, to
bestow money or food on the poor,
to instruct the ignorant in human
knowledge merely, is but little. We
should, above all, give spiritual alms.
The alms their souls need is the
truth.... For me, the truth is
Catholicism."</p>

<p>"I suppose, then, monsieur, with
such sentiments, you cannot accept
the conditions I propose?"</p>

<p>"No, monsieur, I cannot. Doing
good in the way you wish would
have but little attraction for me. I
had the serious misfortune to live for
many years as if I had no belief.
Now I have returned, heart and
soul, to the faith, I wish to make
myself truly useful to others, and to
repair, if possible, the time I have
lost. I wish, therefore, to take the
stand of a Catholic, and not of a
philanthropist&mdash;to be useful, not to
appear so."</p>

<p>"Monsieur, I have always had a
high respect for people of frankness
and decided convictions, and they
entitle you to my esteem; but, your
convictions being opposed to mine,
we cannot live together."</p>

<p>"I regret it, sir, but I am of your
opinion."</p>

<p>"I assure you, monsieur, that my
regret is not less than yours. But
though forced to separate for grave
reasons, there need be no precipitation
about it."</p>

<p>"Just as you please, monsieur."</p>

<p>"Well, you can fix the day of
your departure yourself."</p>

<p>Mr. Smithson and Louis then separated.
Mme. Smithson had succeeded!
A quarter of an hour later,
she imparted the agreeable news to
Albert.</p>

<p>"We are rid of him!" said Albert.
"Well, for lack of anything better, I
will content myself with this semi-victory.
I shall never forget, aunt,
the service you have done me on
this occasion. I have no hope now
of marrying Eugénie, but I am sure
the other will never get her, and
that is a good deal!"</p>

<p>"You give up the struggle too
readily," said Mme. Smithson, in a
self-sufficient and sarcastic tone. "I
am more hopeful about the future
than you."</p>

<p>Eugénie was likewise informed
that very morning of all that had
taken place. Her mother took care
to do that. The news, though anticipated,
agitated her so that she
came near betraying her feelings.
But she saw in an instant the danger
to which she was exposing herself.
Making an energetic effort to recover
herself, she laughed as she said:
"My cousin ought to be quite satisfied.
Poor fellow! if he undertakes
to rout all he looks upon as rivals,
he is not at the end of his troubles.
There are a great many men I prefer
to him!"</p>

<p>While this was taking place at
Mr. Smithson's, Louis was so distressed
that he shut himself up in
his chamber to recover his calmness.
He came to see me that very eve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>ning,
and related all that had occurred.</p>

<p>"I cannot blame Mr. Smithson,"
he said. "Every means has evidently
been used to prejudice him against
me. There is some base scheme at
the bottom of all this. I have quietly
obtained information which has
convinced me of Adams' hypocrisy.
He never intended to change his religion.
His only aim was to get me
into inextricable difficulty. He has
succeeded. It remains to be discovered
who prompted him to do all
this.... I have tried in vain to
get rid of a suspicion that may be
wrong, for I have no proofs; but it
is continually recurring to me."</p>

<p>"And to me also. Yes, I believe
Albert is at the bottom of it all."</p>

<p>"Well, that is my idea. But what
can I do? Unmask him? That
is, so to speak, impossible. Even
suppose I succeeded, it would not
destroy the fact that Mr. Smithson
regards me with distrust, and has
people around him who depict me
in odious colors. And in the end,
how could I confess my love for his
daughter? I have lost my property
through my own fault. I am not
sure that Mlle. Eugénie loves me.
Even if she cherished a profound
affection for me, I have reason to
believe her parents would regard it
with disapprobation. Whichever way
I look at things, I cannot hide from
myself that my hopes are blasted!...
It is the will of God: I submit;
but the blow is terrible."</p>

<p>"Poor friend! you remained too
long with me. It was your prolonged
absence that has endangered
everything. Allow me, by way of
consoling myself for my regret, to
give you my advice. I feel as if it
were Victor himself who inspires me:
he loved you so much!... Remain
at Mr. Smithson's some days longer.
Instead of manifesting any coolness
towards him, appear as you used to.
Everything is not lost as long as you
retain his esteem. If you meet with
Mlle. Eugénie, do not avoid her.
The time has come when she ought
to know you as you are. Yes, we
have at last arrived at the decisive
hour which Victor spoke of the night
before he died. Mlle. Eugénie must
now be enabled to appreciate you as
you deserve. She must pity you....
She must love you! If this is not
the case, however sad it will be to
give up an illusion without which it
seems impossible to be happy, renounce
it, and acknowledge without
shrinking: 'She does not love me;
she never will love me; she is not
the wife God destines me.' But do
not act hastily. Believe me, if she
is intended for you, whatever has
been done, nothing is lost. But it is
my opinion she is intended for you."</p>

<p>These words did Louis good. "I
hope you are not deceived," said he,
"and this very hope revives me. I
will try to believe you are right.
We will do nothing hastily, therefore.
But do you not think I could now
venture to disclose my sentiments to
Mlle. Eugénie, if I have a favorable
opportunity, and see it will give no
offence? One consideration alone
restrains me&mdash;I fear being suspected
of seeking her hand from interested
motives."</p>

<p>"The time for such suspicions
is past. If Eugénie still cherishes
them, it will lower her in my estimation.
She is twenty-two years of
age. She has a good deal of heart
and an elevated mind, and is capable
of deciding her own destiny. I
therefore approve of your plan. If she
loves you, she will have the courage
to avow it to her parents. If she
does not love you, she has sufficient
courage to make it evident to you."</p>

<p>"How I wish the question already
decided!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>"No youthful impulsiveness! You
need more than ever to be extremely
cautious while feeling your
way. Your situation is one of great
delicacy. Act, but with deliberation."</p>

<p>Such was pretty nearly the advice
I gave Louis, often stopping to give
vent to my grief, which was as profound
as ever. He left me quite
comforted. Though he did not say
so, for fear of being deceived, he
thought Eugénie loved him, and believed,
with her on his side, he
should triumph over every obstacle.
When a person is in love, he clings
to hope in spite of himself, even
when all is evidently lost.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER XXV.<br />

ALL IS LOST!-THE PROSPECT BRIGHTENS.</h4>

<p>Louis spent several evenings in
succession with me. He briefly related
how the day had passed, and
afterwards took up the different
events, and enlarged upon them.
He often found enough to talk about
for hours upon the sometimes ungrateful
theme. I can still see him
sitting opposite my mother and myself
in the arbor in the little garden
behind our house. Everything was
calm and delightful around us in
those beautiful autumn evenings.
Louis alone was troubled. In vain
we tried to restore peace to his soul:
it was gone!</p>

<p>I never comprehended so thoroughly
all the power of love as then.
The profound sadness in which I
was at that time overwhelmed rendered
me inaccessible to such passionate
outbreaks&mdash;such fits of elevation
and depression as Louis was then
subject to. I gazed at him with a
cool, dispassionate eye, but with the
affectionate compassion with which
we regard a friend who is trying to
make himself unhappy. I was astonished;
sometimes I was even&mdash;yes,
I acknowledge it&mdash;irritated to
see how utterly he gave himself up to
the passion he had allowed to develop
so rapidly in his heart. Doubtless
my poor friend remained resigned
to the will of God, but not so
completely as he thought. It is
true, even when his mind was apparently
the most agitated, we felt that
piety was the overruling principle;
but then, what a struggle there was
between the divine Spirit, which always
seeks to infuse calmness, and
the gusts of passion that so easily
result in a tempest!</p>

<p>Ah! I loved my husband too
sincerely, and I recall other loves
too pure, to dare assert that love is
wrong. But believe me, my young
friend, I do not exaggerate in adding
that, if love is not always censurable,
it is in danger of being so. We are
told on every hand that love ennobles
the heart and tends to elevate
the mind; that it is the mainspring
of great enterprises, and destructive
of egotism. Yes, sometimes; ...
but for love to effect such things,
what watchfulness must not a person
exercise over himself! How much
he must distrust his weakness!
What incessant recourse he must
have to God! Without this, the
love that might ennoble is only debasing,
and to such a degree as to
lead unawares, so to speak, to the
commission of acts unworthy, not
only of a Christian, but a man.</p>

<p>Allow me, my friend, continued
Madame Agnes, to make use of a
comparison, common enough, but
which expresses my idea better than
any other. Love is like generous
wine. It must be used with sobriety
and caution. Taken to excess, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
goes to the head, and makes a fool
of the wisest. You are young. You
have never loved. Beware of the
intoxication to which I allude! If
you ever do love, watch over yourself;
pray with fervor that God will
give you the grace of self-control.
The moment love becomes a passion&mdash;an
overruling passion&mdash;ah! how
its victim is to be pitied! When
reason and conscience require it,
you can&mdash;I mean with the divine
assistance&mdash;banish love from the
heart where it reigns; but believe
me, it will leave you as an enemy
leaves the country it has invaded&mdash;with
fearful destruction behind.
And first of all, it destroys one's
peace of mind. The soul in which
passion has reigned continues to
bear marks of its ravages a long
time after its extinction!...</p>

<p>Louis had arrived at this deplorable
state; he had not full control
over his heart; his happiness depended
on the success of his love. Eugénie's
image beset him everywhere.
The word is hard, I confess, but it is
true. He attached undue importance
to whatever had the least bearing on
this predominant thought. One day,
he announced he had seen Albert
walking with a melancholy air. He
was sad, then. But why should he
be sad unless his cousin had treated
him coldly? And Louis hastily
added by way of conclusion: "Mlle.
Eugénie knows all I have to annoy
me; she follows me in thought, she
participates in my sorrows, she repays
me for them...." Another
day he had really seen her. She
passed by his window, lovelier than
ever, but more thoughtful. She was
doubtless as anxious as he to be
freed from the suspense in which
they both were.</p>

<p>At last he came with important
news. He had had the unhoped-for
happiness of meeting Eugénie.
She was advancing towards him,
blushing with embarrassment, and
was the first to greet him, with an
expression so friendly as to leave no
doubt of her sentiments. He returned
her salutation, but was so
overpowered with emotion that he
could scarcely speak. After some
words of no importance, he said:
"I am going to leave you, mademoiselle."</p>

<p>Eugénie replied that she should
regret to see him go. Then, as if
to intimate he had enemies in the
house, she added: "More than
one&mdash;I wish I could say all&mdash;will be
as afflicted as I at your departure.
I refer to those you have benefited,
and to whom you might continue to
do good."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Louis, "it is hard to
have to leave my work incomplete.
However limited it is, my soul is in
it. But I must not make myself out
a better Christian than I am. It is
not my work I shall leave with the
most regret...." He dared not
complete the expression of his
thought.</p>

<p>Eugénie, generally so self-restrained,
was visibly affected and intimidated.
She was about to reply, when
Mme. Smithson suddenly made her
appearance. It looked as if she kept
watch over her daughter. When
she saw her talking with Louis, she
could not conceal her annoyance.
Saluting him in a freezing, insolent
manner, she said: "Eugénie, what
are you doing here? Your cousin
is hunting everywhere for you to go
to town with him!"</p>

<p>"There is no hurry," replied Eugénie,
resuming her habitual coolness
and dignity. She went away, taking
leave of Louis with a visible air of
decided sympathy.</p>

<p>This brief interview was sufficient
to render Louis' hopes legitimate.
I agreed with him that Eugénie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
would have behaved very differently
if she regarded him with antipathy,
or even with indifference.</p>

<p>"There is no doubt she knows all
that has taken place," said I to my
friend. "If there is any plot against
you, she cannot fail to be aware of it,
or, at least, suspect it. Under such
circumstances, the very fact of her
showing you unmistakable sympathy
is a sufficient proof that she loves
you."</p>

<p>At this time, an occurrence took
place that had an unfortunate effect
on me, and created new difficulties
in Louis' path. It was then in the
latter part of the month of September.
The summer had been rainy
and unpleasant. The rains increased
in September, and soon caused an
alarming rise in all the rivers. I was
then at the end of my stay in the
little village of St. M&mdash;&mdash;, where I
lived unknown to the Smithsons.
Faithful to my request, Louis had
told no one of my temporary residence
in the vicinity.</p>

<p>Excuse me for giving you here
some topographical details, perhaps
somewhat difficult to comprehend,
but necessary for you to know in
order to understand what follows.</p>

<p>St. M&mdash;&mdash; is situated in a charming
valley. In ordinary weather, the
current of the Loire is below the
level of the valley through which it
winds with a majestic sweep. When
a rise occurs, the plain would at once
be inundated were it not protected
by a dike which the water cannot
cross. This dike did not extend to
Mr. Smithson's manufactory, though
but a short distance from St. M&mdash;&mdash;.
When, therefore, the river got very
high, the mill ran the risk of being
inundated. The dwelling-house
alone was out of danger, being on
an eminence beyond the reach of the
waters of the Loire, even when it
joined, swelled by the junction, the
small stream that drove Mr. Smithson's
machinery.</p>

<p>Having given you some idea of
that region, I will now resume
my story. One evening, then, towards
the end of my stay at St.
M&mdash;&mdash;, Louis told me the Loire was
rising fast. He assured me, however,
before leaving, that there was no
danger. "No matter how strong
or high the current," he said, "the
dike secures you from all danger.
It is as firm as a rock."</p>

<p>My friend was mistaken. The
bank had certain weak places which
the water had undermined without
any one's being aware of it.</p>

<p>Towards eleven o'clock, there was
a tremendous noise in every direction.
People were screaming and
rushing around the house: the dike
had given way! The water had
reached the ground floor. My
mother, my sister, and myself were
lodged on the first story. The proprietor,
beside himself, and frightened
enough to alarm every one else,
came up to tell us we must make
haste to escape; his house was not
solid; we were in danger of being
carried away.</p>

<p>"The water is only rising slowly,"
he said. "By wading two or three
hundred yards, we can reach the
causeway. There we shall be safe;
for the ground is firm, and the
causeway extends to St. Denis.
The inundation cannot reach that
place, for it is built on a height."</p>

<p>I did not lose my presence of
mind in the midst of the alarm.
Victor's death had destroyed all
attachment to life. If my mother
and sister had not been in danger
as well as myself, I should have remained
where I was, trusting in God,
not believing I was under any moral
obligation to escape from a house
which might withstand more than
was supposed; as it did, in fact.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
But my mother and sister lost all
reason, so to speak. Wild with terror,
they fled, and I followed them.
When we got down to the ground
floor, we found the water had risen
to the height of about six inches.
There was a mournful sound in every
direction which made us tremble.
We sprang towards the causeway.
I was at that time in delicate health.
I had been suddenly roused from
sleep. The distance I had to wade
through the cold water had a fearful
effect on me. When we reached the
causeway, they had to carry me to
St. Denis: I was incapable of walking.</p>

<p>While we were thus flying from
danger, Louis committed a series of
generous but imprudent acts which
became a source of fresh difficulties
to him. He was sitting alone in his
chamber, when, about half-past ten,
he heard a dull crash like a discharge
of artillery at a distance.
He hastily ran down into the court,
entered the porter's lodge, and inquired
where the noise came from that
had alarmed him.</p>

<p>"I do not know, monsieur," replied
the man, "but I have an idea
that the levée has given way. At a
great inundation twenty years ago,
the Loire made a large hole in the
dike, which caused a similar noise.
I know something about it, for I
was then living near...."</p>

<p>This was enough to alarm Louis,
and just then a man passed with a
torch in his hand, crying breathlessly:
"The dike has given way at
St. M&mdash;&mdash;! Help! Quick! The
village will be inundated!"</p>

<p>These words redoubled Louis'
terror. St. M&mdash;&mdash; would be inundated;
perhaps it was already....
I was there ill, and knew no one!</p>

<p>"Is there any danger of the water's
reaching us?" asked Louis of the
porter.</p>

<p>"The mill? Yes, ... but not
Mr. Smithson's: that is impossible.
The house stands twenty feet above
the river."</p>

<p>Eugénie and her parents, then,
had nothing to fear. I alone was
in danger&mdash;in so great a danger that
there was not a moment to be lost.</p>

<p>"Go and tell Mr. Smithson all
that has happened," said Louis. "I
am going away. I am obliged to.
I shall be back in half an hour, or as
soon as I can."</p>

<p>Of all the sacrifices Louis ever
made, this was the most heroic. In
fact, had he remained at his post, he
might have saved the machinery,
that was quite a loss to Mr. Smithson.
Instead of that, he hurried off
without any thought of the construction
his enemies might put on his departure.
To complete the unfortunate
complication, Mr. Smithson had
an attack of the gout that very day.
When I afterwards alluded to his imprudence
in thus risking his dearest
interests, as well as life itself, Louis
replied: "I knew Eugénie had nothing
to fear; whereas, you were in
danger. I had promised Victor on
his death-bed to watch over you as
he would himself. It was my duty
to do as I did. If it were to do
over again, I should do the same.
Did Victor hesitate when he sprang
into the water to save me? And he
did not know who I was."</p>

<p>The house I had just left was
about half a league from the mill.
The water was beginning to reach
the highway, though slowly. Louis
kept on, regardless of all danger,
and arrived at our house in feverish
anxiety. I had been gone about fifteen
minutes, and the water was
much higher than when we left.
Louis learned from a man who remained
in a neighboring house that
I was safe: we had all escaped by
the causeway before there was any
danger. He added that I must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
at St. Denis by that time. Louis, reassured
as to my fate, succeeded in
reaching another road, more elevated,
but not so direct to the mill.
This road passed just above the Vinceneau
house. When Louis arrived
opposite the house, he saw the water
had reached it. He heard screams
mingled with oaths that came from
the father, angry with his wife and
daughter. Having returned home a
few moments before, the drunken
man was resisting the efforts of both
women to induce him to escape.
Louis appeared as if sent by Providence.
He at once comprehended
the state of affairs. His look overawed
the drunken man, who left the
house. They all four proceeded toward
the mill. There was no nearer
place of refuge. The first people
they saw at their arrival were Durand,
Albert, and some workmen.
An insolent smile passed over Albert's
face. He evidently suspected
Louis of having abandoned everything
for the purpose of saving
Madeleine Vinceneau. But he did
not dare say anything. Louis intimidated
him much more than he
could have wished. He resolved,
however, to make a good use of
what he had seen. Louis at once
felt how unfortunate this combination
of circumstances was, but the
imminent danger they were in forced
him to exertion. It was feared the
walls of the manufactory might give
way under the action of the water, if
it got much higher, and it was gradually
rising.</p>

<p>Louis set to work without any delay.
The workmen, who had hastened
from every part of the neighborhood
to take refuge at Mr. Smithson's,
began under his direction to
remove the machinery that was still
accessible. They afterwards propped
up the walls, and, when these various
arrangements were completed, Louis,
who had taken charge of everything,
occupied himself in providing temporary
lodgings for the people driven
out by the inundation.</p>

<p>Mme. Smithson and her daughter
had come down to render assistance.
The refugees were lodged in various
buildings on a level with the house.
Louis would have given everything
he possessed for the opportunity of
exchanging a few words with Eugénie
at once, in order to forestall the
odious suspicions Albert would be
sure to excite in her mind. But he
was obliged to relinquish the hope.
Mme. Smithson and Albert followed
her like a shadow. Louis could not
approach her without finding one or
the other at her side. Overcome
by so fatiguing a night, he went
towards morning to take a little repose.
He felt sure fresh mortifications
awaited him in consequence of
what had just taken place, and he
was right.</p>

<p>When he awoke after a few hours'
sleep, his first care was to go and
see Mr. Smithson. He related what
he had done, without concealing
the fact of his abandoning the mill to
go to my assistance. Mr. Smithson
was suffering severely from the gout.
He was impatient at such a time to
be on his feet, and was chafing with
vexation.</p>

<p>"I cannot blame you, monsieur,"
he said. "The life of a friend is
of more consequence than anything
else. Whatever be the material loss
I may have to endure at this time in
consequence of your absence, I forbear
complaining. But it was unfortunate
things should happen so.
If I had only been able to move!...
But no.... You will
acknowledge, monsieur, that I am
the victim of misfortune.... Did
you succeed, after all, in saving the
person whose fate interested you
more than anything else?..."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>"She had made her escape before
my arrival. I hurried back, but, on
the way, a new incident occurred.
An unfortunate family was on the
point of perishing. I brought them
with me, as there was no nearer asylum."</p>

<p>"Are these people employed at
the mill?"</p>

<p>"The woman works here; her husband
elsewhere."</p>

<p>"What is their name?"</p>

<p>"Vinceneau."</p>

<p>"I think I have heard of them.
The father is a drunkard; the mother
is an indolent woman."</p>

<p>"You may have learned these facts
from Mlle. Eugénie, who takes an interest
in the family, I believe. I recommended
them to her."</p>

<p>"Was that proper?... I have
every reason to think otherwise....
But it is done. We will say no more
about it. And since I am so inopportunely
confined to my bed, I must
beg you to continue to take charge
in my place, watch over the safety of
the inundated buildings, provide for
the wants of the people who have
taken refuge here, and, above all,
have everything done in order."</p>

<p>Louis was uneasy and far from
being satisfied. There was a certain
stiffness and ill-humor in Mr. Smithson's
manner that made him think
Albert had reported his return to the
mill with the Vinceneau family. He
attempted an explanation on this delicate
subject.</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</i> you seem very anxious
about such a trifling affair," said
Mr. Smithson. "It appears to me
there is something of much more importance
to be thought of now....
It is high time to try to remedy the
harm done last night...."</p>

<p>Louis felt that, willing or not, he
must await a more propitious time.
He went away more depressed than
ever.</p>

<p>The whole country around was inundated.
I was obliged to send a
boat for news concerning my young
friend, and give him information
about myself. The unfortunate people
who had taken refuge at Mr.
Smithson's were at once housed and
made as comfortable as possible.
It happened that Durand and some
others were put in the same building
with the Vinceneau family. Nothing
occurred the first day worth relating.
Louis watched in vain for an opportunity
of seeing and speaking to
Eugénie. He only saw her at a distance.
The next morning&mdash;O unhoped-for
happiness!&mdash;he met her on
her way to one of the houses occupied
by the refugees. She looked at him
so coldly that he turned pale and his
limbs almost gave way beneath him.
But Eugénie was not timid. She had
sought this interview, and was determined
to attain her object.</p>

<p>"Whom have you put in that
house?" she asked, pointing to the
one assigned to the Vinceneaus,
which was not two steps from the
small building occupied by Louis
himself.</p>

<p>"The Vinceneau family and some
others," replied Louis.</p>

<p>At that name, Eugénie's lips contracted.
An expression of displeasure
and contempt passed across her
face. Then, looking at Louis with a
dignity that only rendered her the
more beautiful, she said: "Then you
still have charge of them? I thought
you gave them up to me."</p>

<p>"I have had nothing to do with
them till within two days, mademoiselle.
It was enough to know you
took an interest in their condition."
He then briefly related all that had
taken place the night of the inundation,
and ended by speaking of the
letter I had written to relieve his
anxiety. He finished by presenting
the letter to Eugénie, under the pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>text
of showing her the reproaches
I addressed him. I wrote him that,
before troubling himself about me,
he ought to have been sure he was
not needed at Mr. Smithson's.</p>

<p>Eugénie at first declined reading
the letter. Then she took it with a
pleasure she endeavored to conceal.
Before reading it, she said:</p>

<p>"Why did you not tell me your
friend was at St. M&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I have been greatly preoccupied
for some time, and I seldom
see you, mademoiselle. It was in a
manner impossible to tell you that
my poor friend had come here to
be quiet and gain new strength in
solitude."</p>

<p>"I should have been pleased to
see her." So saying, Eugénie, without
appearing to attach any importance
to it, read my letter from beginning
to end.</p>

<p>Thus all Albert and Mme. Smithson's
calculations were defeated.
There is no need of my telling you
the inference Louis' enemies had
drawn from the interest he had manifested
in the Vinceneau family.</p>

<p>"He left everything to save them,
or rather, to save that girl," said
Mme. Smithson. "He would have
let us all perish rather than not save
her."</p>

<p>My being at St. M&mdash;&mdash;, and my
letter, threw a very different light on
everything. Thenceforth, Louis, dismissed
by her father, and calumniated
by her mother and Albert, was,
in Eugénie's eyes, a victim. And he
had risked his own life to save that
of his friend. It is said that noble
hearts, especially those of women,
regard the <i lang="fr">rôle</i> of victim as an attractive
one.</p>

<p>When Eugénie left Louis, there
was in the expression of her eyes,
and in the tone of her voice, something
so friendly and compassionate
that he felt happier than he had
for a long time.... To obtain
this interview, Eugénie had been
obliged to evade not only her mother's
active vigilance, but that of
her cousin and Fanny. This vigilance,
suspended for a moment, became
more active than ever during
the following days. It was impossible
to speak to Louis; but she saw
him sometimes, and their eyes spoke
intelligibly....</p>

<p>The water receded in the course
of a week. Louis profited thereby to
come and see me, and make me a
sharer in his joy. I was then somewhat
better. I passed the night of
the inundation in fearful suffering,
but felt relieved the following day.
My dreadful attack of paralysis did
not occur till some weeks afterwards.
I little thought then I had symptoms
of the seizure that has rendered my
life so painful.</p>

<p>The refugees were still living at
the manufactory, the Vinceneau family
among them. Louis had scarcely
returned to his room that night,
when he heard a low knock at
his door, and Madeleine Vinceneau
presented herself before him.</p>

<h3>THE NAPOLEONIC IDEA AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.</h3>


<p class="center">FROM THE CIVILTA CATTOLICA.
</p>


<h4>I.</h4>

<p>For several weeks past, we have
heard much of Louis Napoleon Bonaparte.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Nothing less than his
mournful physical death, on the 9th
of January, 1873, was needed to draw
him from the oblivion to which Italian
liberals consigned him after his
political death of September 2, 1870.
It would seem that from the imperial
grave opened at Chiselhurst
went forth a bitter reproach against
the unexampled ingratitude of those
who saw the tombstone of Sedan
close over his empire with mute impassibility
and secret joy. Now to
the cowardly silence of two years
succeeds an uproar of elegies and
praises. Remorse for having left the
conqueror of Solferino in the mire
of the Meuse is lulled to sleep by
the wailing of hired mourners; as if
the shame of basely forsaking him
could be masked behind a block of
unblushing marble.</p>

<p>No man was ever more fatal to
himself than Napoleon III. All
which was his by usurpation or right
turned against him in the end. His
worst humiliations were the work of
his own hands. He destroyed himself,
and the words of the Christian
Demosthenes were truer of him than
of others: <i lang="la">Nemo nisi a se ipso læditur</i>.</p>

<p>Now, by a final mockery of fortune,
he is punished after death by
having bier and tomb dishonored
with the apotheosis of the Italian
party who laud to the skies the weapon
that worked his ruin&mdash;the ruling
idea of his reign.</p>

<p>This idea, which necessarily failed
because it was impracticable, and in
its failure reduced him to nothing, is
his sole title to compassion or glory
in the opinion of this faction. But
as the cruel irony contains a historical
lesson, useful for the present and
the future, we will study it by the
light of facts, incontestable except to
the blind.</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p>Such were the contradictions, perplexities,
and duplicity of Louis Napoleon
Bonaparte upon the throne,
that he was often believed to be a
prince reigning at hap-hazard. Indeed,
it is said, now that he has left
the earth, that the history of his
incomprehensible reign will be the
most difficult work ever undertaken.
This seems to us a mistake, if a distinction
be made between the man
and the prince, his life and his reign.
The man and his life will always
seem inextricable, for he used all
means that suited his convenience,
and in their choice gave preference
to no moral rule or principle of honesty;
following openly or hiddenly
the mutable interest of each day.
But the prince and his reign, in spite
of apparent contradictions, are easily
understood by the simple study of
the political end which he invariably
proposed to himself.</p>

<p>This end is not hidden. His
youthful writings, and the series of
his imperial documents, read by the
light of the actions of his administration,
make it plain. He aimed at reestablishing
and consolidating in his
dynasty the power of the First Empire,
and at the elevation of France
to the headship of Europe, reorgan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>ized
in its territorial divisions according
to the law of nationality, and in
its institutions in accordance with
the forms of Cæsarean democracy.</p>

<p>An author who has read his books,
and confronted them with the achievements
of his reign, thus sums up the
new <em>Napoleonic idea</em> constantly pursued
by Louis in his youth, middle
life, and old age, in exile, in prison,
and on the throne:</p>

<p>"Peoples distributed according to
their needs and instincts, belonging
each to a self-elected country, provided
each with a constitution fixed
yet democratic; devoted at their
choice to works of civil industry destined
to transform the world; Europe,
free in her various nations, consolidated
almost into a federated republic,
with France as its centre;
France aggrandized and forming the
clasp in the strong chain of free
intercourse; universal exhibitions to
encourage nations in the exchange
of reciprocal visits; European congresses,
where governments, laying
aside arms, could compose their
differences; Paris, the imperial city
<i lang="fr">par excellence</i>, wonderfully embellished,
raised to the honors of capital of
the world, metropolis of wealth and
wisdom, under the wing of the Napoleonic
eagle, offering to the two
hemispheres the rarest discoveries in
science, masterpieces of art, exquisite
refinements of luxury and civilization."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p class="center"><i lang="la">Divisum imperium cum Jove Cæsar habet!</i>
</p>

<p>Such was the intoxicating dream
of the life and reign of Napoleon III.,
the idea which he believed himself
created to carry out&mdash;a combination
of the designs of Henry IV. and
the aspirations of Augustus, mounted
on the frail pedestal of the principles
of 1789.</p>

<p>In fact, proceeds our author,
"Within and without the confines of
the Empire, this idea was reduced to
two words: reconstruction and reconciliation,
based upon the principles
of the French Revolution.
Here was to be the general synthesis
of all external and internal politics
in France and Europe: Reconstruction
of nations founded on national
will within and without; effected by
a single instrument&mdash;<em>universal suffrage</em>&mdash;applied
to the determination of the
nationality as well as of the sovereign
and the government; reconciliation
of nations among themselves,
and of the divers classes composing
them, thanks to an equal satisfaction
of the rights and interests of all."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>That nothing might be wanting to
the enchantment of his fair dream, the
young prisoner of Ham contemplated
a double mission of giving peace
and glory to France. "War was to
consolidate peace, imperial battles
were to give repose to the world.
Thus the famous device, <em>The Empire
and Peace</em>, came to bear a sublime
significance."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>In short, the Napoleonic idea had
for its ultimate aim the aggrandizement
and European omnipotence
of France under the dynasty of the
Bonapartes, through the universal
means of popular suffrage with
<em>plébiscites</em>, forming a basis of a new
national and international right, opposed
to the old historical right of
peoples. The other three principles
of territorial compensation, non-intervention
and accomplished facts, were
special means and passing aids to
be used according to opportunity for
carrying out intentions.</p>


<h4>III.</h4>

<p>Louis Napoleon received his political
education from his uncle exiled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>in the Island of St. Helena, and from
the Carbonari, among whom Ciro
Menotti enrolled him in Tuscany,
in the year 1831.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> In these two
schools he acquired the fundamental
idea of reconstructing European
countries according to nationality.
But he did not see that, in the hands
of Napoleon I. and of the Carbonari,
this idea was a strong weapon of destruction,
not a practical or powerful
argument for reconstruction. Bonaparte,
gaoler of European potentates,
and the Carbonari, persecuted by
them, wished to use it to destroy the
order of things established by the
Holy Alliance in the treaty of Vienna
of 1815, upon the right, more or less
defined, of legitimacy. On the pretext
of restoring political nationality
to peoples, the first Napoleon bequeathed
to his heirs the command
to excite Italy and Hungary against
Austria; Poland against Russia and
Prussia; Greece and the Christian
principalities against Turkey; Ireland,
Malta, and the Ionian Isles against
England; hoping that the changes
originating in this movement, and
the gratitude of these nations, would
make easy to his heirs the extension
of French boundaries and the
recovery of the imperial crown.</p>

<p>The Carbonari worked with the
same pretext to overthrow princes
and substitute themselves, with a
view of introducing into states their
anti-Christian and anti-social systems.</p>

<p>The so-called principle of nationality
resolved itself, then, with Napoleon
I. and the Carbonari, into a pure
engine of war&mdash;into a battery which,
after destroying the bulwarks of the
opposite principle of legitimacy,
should give into their hands nations
and kingdoms. That Louis Napoleon,
in prison, a fugitive, a conspirator,
should support himself with this
flattering principle, and dexterously
dazzle with it the eyes of those who
could help him to recover the sceptre
of France, can be easily understood;
but that, after obtaining this
sceptre by a network of circumstances
wholly foreign to the principle
of nationality, he should adopt that
principle as the final aim of his empire
and the corner-stone of his own
greatness and of French power&mdash;this,
in truth, is hard to understand.</p>

<p>But that it was the case is only too
clear. He spent the twenty years
of his dominion over France in coloring
the design which he had puzzled
out twenty years before, dreaming
over the memories of St. Helena,
and plotting in the collieries of the
Carbonari.</p>


<h4>IV.</h4>

<p>To a sagacious mind which had
well weighed the true worth of the
Napoleonic idea, even before the
new emperor attempted its fulfilment,
terrible dangers and obstacles must
have presented themselves.</p>

<p>After a succession of wars and
successful conspiracies had led nations
to an independent reconstruction
within natural frontiers, what increase
of territory could have accrued
to France?</p>

<p>Suppose Italy, Poland, Hungary,
and Iberia adjusted on this principle,
would their power have remained
so equalized as to leave France
secure of preponderance?</p>

<p>If Germany had been so reconstructed,
to the certain advantage of
Prussia, was there not a risk of exposing
France to a shock which
might have proved fatal?</p>

<p>According to the theory of natural
limits, the aggrandizement which
France could have demanded in
compensation for protection and
successful warfare would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
reduced to some additions towards
the Alps, the Pyrenees, and in Flanders;
to a few thousand square kilometres,
and perhaps three or four
millions of inhabitants. Towards the
Rhine, we cannot see what the Empire
could have claimed without
contradicting the theory itself.
Germany has maintained that Alsace
and half of Lorraine, incorporated
with French soil, are German, and
has forced them to a legal annexation
to her territory. Now, were
these slender acquisitions, so disproportioned
to the acquisitions
of neighboring countries, worth the
cost of turning Europe upside down,
and subjecting France to a chance
of political and military ruin?</p>

<p>Louis Napoleon rejoiced in the
thought of one day resuscitating the
fair name of Italy, extinguished for
many years, and restoring it to provinces
so long deprived of it. This
sounds well; but was this resurrection
to end in a united kingdom, or
in the simple emancipation from
foreign rule? And granted that
unity could not be prevented, and
that it should prove equal to the
imaginary union of Spain and Portugal,
was it really advantageous to
create alongside of France, from a
platonic love of nationality, two new
states of twenty-five millions of souls
each, capable of supplanting her
later in the Mediterranean.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> And
if Prussia, taking advantage of the
loss of Italy and Hungary to her
rival Austria, had united in a single
political and military body the scattered
members of Germany, would
it have been useful and hopeful for
France to feel herself pressed on the
other side by a kingdom or empire
of fifty millions of inhabitants, a
military race of the first order?</p>

<p>Moreover, what would have become
of the Roman Pontiff in this
renovation of countries, governments,
and juridical laws. The Pope is a
great moral power, the greatest in
the world. If his independence
were to give way before the principle
of nationality, what would become
of his religious liberty, so necessary
to the public quiet of consciences.
Could a pope, subject to
an Italy constructed in any way soever,
increase the light, peace, and
tranquillity of France and the rest of
Europe? Would the palace of the
Vatican, changed into a prison, have
accorded with the imagined splendors
of the Tuileries?</p>

<p>Finally, a new international and
national right, which should have
sanctioned, in accordance with popular
suffrage, the obligation of non-intervention
and accomplished facts,
far from reconciling nations and various
classes of citizens among themselves
by superseding the inalienable
right of nature, would have become
a firebrand of civil discord, an incentive
to foreign wars, and a germ of
revolutions which would have plunged
Europe into the horrors of socialism.</p>

<p>An eagle eye was not needed to
see and foresee these weighty dangers.
However affairs might have
turned, even if they had succeeded
according to every wish, it is indubitable
that the ship of Napoleonic
politics, following in its navigation
the star of this idea, must eventually
have struck on three rocks, each one
hard enough to send ship and pilot
to the bottom: the Papacy, Germany,
and Revolution. The Papacy,
oppressed by the Italy of the
Carbonari, would have taken from
France her greatest moral force.
Germany, in one way or another,
strongly united in her armies, would
have tried, as in 1813, to overwhelm
the Empire. Revolution, kindled
and fed from without, would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
gathered strength in France to the
ruin of the Empire.</p>

<p>These rocks were not only visible,
but palpable to touch. Napoleon
III. saw them, felt them, and used
all the licit and illicit arts of his
administration to avoid them. In
vain; it was impossible. He should
not have followed the guidance of
his enchantress, his idea; following it,
perdition was inevitable.</p>


<h4>V.</h4>

<p>Perhaps history offers no other example
of a man who has grasped the
sceptre under conditions so propitious
for good and so opposed to evil as
those under which Louis Napoleon
Bonaparte began his reign; or of
one who has so pertinaciously abused
his advantages to his own ruin and
that of others.</p>

<p>The vote of the better and larger
portion of the French nation had
raised him to the throne, that he
might save them from the hydra of
socialism, and stop the course of political
changes in France. Europe,
just recovering from terrible agitations,
welcomed his elevation as a
pledge of order and peace. Catholics
of every country rejoiced over it
almost as the reward of the uncontested
restoration in Rome of the
principality of S. Peter. Interest
and conscience seemed to unite in inducing
him to take the triumphal
road of justice which must lead to
certain glory.</p>

<p>But <i lang="la">cum in honore esset non intellexit</i>.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
He seemed to wish to take
this path. But, in fact, he showed
that he was preparing to follow another
by the ephemeral light of that
<em>idea</em> which he worshipped on the imperial
throne with the same devotion
which he had professed in prison
and in exile.</p>

<p>The Crimean war, to a participation
in which he invited little Piedmont,
predestined by him to enjoy
the benefits of Italian resurrection,
helped him to cut the knot of the
Holy Alliance, to humble Russia
and set her at enmity with Austria,
to create by a <em>plébiscite</em> the first of his
national unities&mdash;that of the Roumanian
Principalities&mdash;and to introduce
at the Congress of Paris that subalpine
diplomacy which, endorsed by
him, sowed the seeds of the contemplated
Italian war.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the daggers and bombs
of the Pianori, Tibaldi, and Orsini
came to remind him that, before being
Emperor of the French, he had been
an Italian Carbonaro, and that he was
expected to keep his oaths. It is said
that, after the explosion of Orsini's
bombshell, a friend of the assassin, to
whom Napoleon complained confidentially
of this party persecution,
replied: "You have forgotten that
you are an Italian."</p>

<p>"What shall I do?" asked his majesty.</p>

<p>"Serve your country."</p>

<p>"Very good. But I am Emperor
of the French, a nation hard to govern.
Can I sacrifice the interests of
my people to accommodate those of
Italy?"</p>

<p>"No one will prevent you from
studying the interests of France when
you have promulgated the independence
and secured the unity of your
country. Italy first of all."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>But he had less need of spurring
than was supposed.</p>

<p>After the secret negotiations of
Plombières, he attacked Austria in
the plains of Lombardy, and, having
subdued her, he inaugurated the resurrection
of Italy according to his
idea, which, presiding over the work,
showed itself unveiled, with all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
magnificence of territorial compensation,
universal suffrage, non-intervention,
and accomplished facts, as we
all know.</p>


<h4>VI.</h4>

<p>But the Napoleonic ship got lost
irreparably among the three rocks
above named. Between the Mincio
and the Adige it met Germany in
threatening guise; in Rome, the betrayed
pontiff rose up; and in Paris
revolution lifted her savage head.
For eleven years Bonaparte struggled
to save the ship from the straits into
which his Italian enterprise had driven
it; but the more earnest his efforts,
the worse became the entanglement,
until the tempest of 1870 split the
vessel in the midst with awful shipwreck.</p>

<p>His crimes towards the Pope, the
ignoble artifice of insults couched in
reverential terms, of perfidy, lies, and
hypocrisy, alienated from him not
only Catholics, but all those who
honored human loyalty and natural
probity. The so-called Roman question,
a compendium of the whole
Italian question, ruined the credit
of Napoleon III., unmasked him, and
made him appear as inexorable history
will show him to posterity&mdash;a
monster of immorality, to use the apt
expression of one of his former sycophants.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Prussia, after checking him at the
Mincio in 1859, cut short in his
hands the thread of the web woven
in 1863 to regenerate Poland on the
plan of Italy. God did not permit a
good and noble cause like that of
Poland to be contaminated by the
influence of the Napoleonic idea;
and this seems to us an indication
that he reserves to her a restoration
worthy of herself and of her faith.
Prussia also held him at bay during
the Danish war, into which he threw
himself with closed eyes, in the mad
hope of conquering Mexico, and making
it an empire after his own idea.
This whim cost France a lake of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>blood, many millions of francs, and
an indelible stain; it cost the unfortunate
Maximilian of Austria his life,
and his gifted wife her reason. Prussia
solemnly mocked at him in the
other war of 1866, when, leagued
with Italy by his consent, she attacked
the Austrian Empire.</p>

<p>It was the beginning of that political
and military unity of Germany which
was destined to make him pay dear
for the work of unity accomplished
beyond the Alps by so many crimes.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Lastly, Prussia, choosing the occasion
of the vacancy of the Spanish
throne, and seconded by him in the
promotion of an Iberian unity like
that of Italy, and prepared by a subalpine
marriage, drew him into the
toils where he left his crown and his
honor.</p>

<p>Step by step with the barriers opposed
by Prussia to the foolish policy
of Napoleon III. in Europe went
the anxieties caused in the empire by
revolution. Losing gradually the
support of the honest Catholic plurality
of the French, he thought to
reinforce himself by flattering his
enemy, demagogism, and by unchaining
gradually passions irreligious,
anarchical, destructive to civilization.
Taking all restraint from
the press, he removed every bar to
theatrical license, gave unchecked
liberty to villany, free course to nefarious
impiety and a Babylonish libertinism,
and finished by opening the
doors to public schools of socialism.
But as outside France his duplicity
and cowardly frauds had drawn
upon him the hatred and contempt
of accomplices and beneficiaries, so
at home they excited discontent and
distrust among all parties.</p>

<p>On the 2d and 4th of September,
1870, he reaped at Sedan and
in Paris the crop sowed by him in
1859. Germany broke his sword,
and the Revolution his sceptre. The
Napoleonic idea touched the apex
of its triumphs.</p>


<h4>VII.</h4>

<p>The old Prince Theodore of Metternich,
after 1849, predicted of Louis
Bonaparte, then only President of
the French Republic, that he would
restore the Empire, and ruin himself
as revolutionary emperor in Italy.
Donoso Cortès, Marquis of Valdegamas,
predicted a little later that
Bonaparte, after becoming emperor,
would work very hard, but the fruits
of his labors would be enjoyed by
another; by whom he could not say.
Both these shrewd statesmen knew
Louis Napoleon, the secret chains
which bound him to his party, and
the idea which clouded his mind,
and both hit the mark; for Napoleon
III. made every effort throughout
his reign to play the revolutionary
emperor in Italy; and, with all
his refined policy, he worked for no
one but the King of Prussia. Thanks
to this policy, William enjoys the
vassalage of the only two national
unities created by the Napoleonic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
idea: the Roumanian, whose head is
a Prussian prince, and the Italian,
whose kingdom has become a Prussian
regiment of hussars. He enjoys
the German Empire reared on the
ruins of that of France; and, moreover,
he enjoys European supremacy,
taken from France with the keys of
Paris, and five <em>milliards</em> poured by
her into the Prussian treasury, to
pay expenses. In his own good
time we shall see for whom Bismarck
has made and still makes the
King of Prussia work.</p>

<p>Such are the weighty consequences
of that idea whose execution
Bonaparte believed was to make the
world over again, and raise his race
and France to the summit of power&mdash;a
political calamity, military ruin, and
a dynastic downfall the most terrible
which history has to record.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the dogma of nationality
for which French liberalism
played the fool with Napoleon has
caused the loss to France of two
provinces as opulent as those which
Bonaparte took from Italy in homage
to the same dogma. The principle
of non-intervention, so carefully
guarded by Bonaparte at the cost
of the Roman Pontiff, and so loudly
applauded by French liberalism, has
borne fruit to France in her hour of
sorest need, in the desertion of all
those states, and especially of Italy,
who owed their existence to French
blood, and gold, and honor.</p>

<p>The new right of 1789, perfected
by Napoleonic Carbonarism, of which
Bonaparte, with the approval of
French liberalism, made himself the
apostle in Europe to the disturbance
of the best-ordered countries, has
sprung up for France in the joys of
Sept. 4, 1870, in the delights of the
Commune of 1871, and in the comfort
of her present peace and security.</p>

<p>Thus has Bonaparte's idea crushed
him and reduced him to nothing.
The unhappy man has had not only
the anguish of suffering historical
dishonor while yet alive, but also
that sharpest pang of seeing all the
most celebrated works of his reign
destroyed. The destruction, military,
moral, political, and in part material,
of France, which he hoped to raise
to the summit of greatness; the
destruction of the palaces of Saint
Cloud and the Tuileries, embellished
by him with Asiatic magnificence;
the destruction of popular votes,
those wings which bore him from
exile to the throne; of the treaty
of Paris, that crowned his Crimean
victories; of the glory of the French
name in Mexico with the empire
founded by him; of the treaty of
Prague, for which he well-nigh sweated
blood in opposing the union of
Germany under Prussia: in short,
all his enterprises have resulted in
smoke. Only one remains&mdash;the
subalpine kingdom of Italy, for whose
formation and support the wretched
man staked crown and honor. But
before closing his eyes for ever, he
tasted the sweetness of his last
treachery in seeing that kingdom
pass from his bondage to that of the
conqueror of France. If God still
allows it to his soul, he may now see
his beloved Italy, with a Prussian
helmet on her head, bend over his
tomb, and shed two crocodile's tears&mdash;the
only kind of tears which he
deserved. Let us see what the
Napoleonic idea has lavished upon
her blind idolater&mdash;the defeat at
Sedan, the burning of Paris, the
lonely tomb at Chiselhurst. It was
an idea conceived without God and
his Christ, and against them, and
therefore unable to bring forth anything
but ruin and death. And certain
ruin and death it will bring on
him who shall hope to live and grow
great under its influence.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_25_25" id="Footnote_25_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> He was in science a phenomenon, in history
an adventurer, in morality a monster (<cite>Le Siècle</cite>,
Jan. 12, 1873). Amid the labyrinth of contradictions
in which Bonaparte enveloped his thoughts
concerning the political condition in which he
meant to place the Roman Pontiff, it is impossible
to decide what was his true conception, or
whether he had formed any fixed and definite
plan. In 1859, when he dreamed of three kingdoms
in Italy, one subalpine, a second for his
cousin Jerome, and a third for his cousin Murat,
Napoleon III. traced upon the map of the Peninsula
with his own hand a small circlet enclosing
the new Pontifical state, including Rome, and
five provinces. At the end of that year, the
dream vanished through the opposition of Lord
Palmerston in the famous <em>opuscule, The Pope and
the Congress</em>, where he showed a wish to restrict
the dominion of the Holy Father to Rome, converted
into something like a Hanseatic city. In
Sept., 1863, according to the revelations of Marquis
Carlo Alfieri (<cite>L'Italia Liberale</cite>, p. 83), who
declares himself well informed, Bonaparte consented
to the "gradual withdrawal of French
troops from Rome, so arranged that, on the departure
of the last French battalion, the territorial
dominion of the Pontiff should be reduced
to the city of Rome, the suburban campagna,
and the road and port of Cività Vecchia." So
the Pope would have remained king of a city,
a road, and a port. In 1867, when the nation
obliged Bonaparte to go to the aid of the Pontiff,
assailed by the <em>irregolari</em> of Italy, he wished
the state to remain as it was left after the dismemberment
of 1860, and commanded the Italian
regulars to withdraw from Viterbo and Frosinone,
which they did with military punctuality.
In that year, and during the perplexities (says
<em>l'Armonia</em> of Jan. 12, 1873), there came to visit
him in Paris an illustrious Italian who enjoyed
his confidence, and had been decorated by his
imperial hand with the cross of the Legion of
Honor. This gentleman, engrossed with the
position of the Pope, was lamenting it with Napoleon
III., and remarked that, unless reparation
were made, the Revolution would enter Rome.
The ex-emperor replied: "So long as Pius IX.
lives, I shall never permit it. After the death of
Pius IX., I will adjust the affairs of the church."
If we question whether after his dethronement
the unhappy man approved the accomplished
fact of Sept. 20, 1870, <em>l'Opinione</em> of Jan. 18, 1873,
removes all doubt. It tells us that an individual
(generally supposed to be Count Arese, a great
friend of his), visited him at Chiselhurst, and,
when the conversation turned to Rome, where
the Italian government was established, Napoleon
III. said with entire frankness that he had
personal engagements with the Pope, to which
as emperor he could never have proved faithless;
but that, since his dethronement, Italian
politics had passed beyond his action. And he
added: "This was to be foreseen as being in the
order of facts, and it is not an occasion for
turning back." From which we may infer that
he wished the temporal power of the popes to
cease with Pius IX., without caring to substitute
for their necessary liberty any other guarantee
than that of chance. This will be enough to
convince posterity that Napoleon III. was not
a statesman of the first order.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_26_26" id="Footnote_26_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> A partisan or well-wisher has tried to represent
Napoleon as an edifying Catholic. The
<cite>Univers</cite> of January 25, 1873, has a curious panegyric,
in which it is affirmed that he loved our
Lord Jesus Christ. In the Gospels, our Lord
has taught us a rule for judging those who love
him and do not love him: <em>By their fruits you
shall know them</em> (Matt. vii. 16). Now, the long
and crafty war of Bonaparte against Christ in
his vicar, and the unbridled license given to
Renan and to irreligious papers to blaspheme at
will the divine majesty of Jesus Christ, while he
severely punished those who offended his own
imperial majesty, give the true measure of his
love for Jesus Christ. By the argument of facts
constant, public, and notorious, Napoleon III.
is judged. He has been for the church and for
Christian society a great scourge of God, one of
the worst precursors of Antichrist. We shall
believe in his pretended conversion when we
have seen a single action which shall disclaim
and make amends for the immense scandal of
his Julianic persecution of Catholicity. His repentance
at the hour of death, of which we have
no solid proof, we leave to the infinite mercy of
God, who certainly could inspire him with it.
But it is not out of place to remember the words
of S. Augustine about similar conversions: Of
certain examples we have but one&mdash;the good
thief on Calvary. <i lang="la">Unus est ne desperes</i>, but

<h3>MY FRIEND AND HIS STORY.</h3>


<p>I had been spending the winter
with a friend in poor health in the
South of France. I will not name
the place, but it was one of the loveliest
spots on the northern Mediterranean
coast. Perhaps I shall
have something to tell of it at another
time.</p>

<p>After prolonging our stay till we
began to feel that a change would
be beneficial, we travelled on along
the glorious old Cornice road into
Italy, and sat ourselves down among
the palms and olives of a region that,
on account of its eastern vegetation
and general likeness to the Holy Land,
is often called "the Jericho of the
Riviera."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> For, in truth, when the
traveller climbs the steep slopes and
staircases of that old town, pierced
by narrow, winding troughs of streets,
tied together, as it were, by old
crumbling bridges and arches, built
as a protection against continual
earthquakes; and after groping
through what is more like a labyrinth
of subterranean caves than a town
of civilized build, he gains the crest
of the hill, and looks down from
the sanctuary of the Blessed Virgin
which is its crown, the actual Holy
Land itself seems spread below his
feet. There are the very outlines of
Palestine: The stony slabs and tilted
strata of crag and ridge; the
aromatic shrubs; the wealth of sad
olives, fruit-bearing to an extraordinary
degree; the vast tanks, haunted
by bright-green, persistently serenading
frogs; the lizards darting in the
hot glare; the flat-topped, low houses,
and the women carrying jars of
the identical Eastern forms on their
heads. The very dark-skinned men
and women themselves have the like
sad, sweet, mournful Eastern eyes;
for throughout the Riviera there is
a large admixture of Arab blood, as
many Arab words are crystallized in
the strange, rough <i lang="fr">patois</i> of the
speech.</p>

<p>In this wild, bright, solemn country,
I found and made the friend
whose story I am going to tell; and,
if it is disappointing at first to the
expectant, I shall ask them to wait
till they near the end.</p>

<p>We lived in a not very comfortable
boarding-house outside the town,
chosen on account of its position,
and being quite removed from the
noise of the sea, which those acquainted
with the Mediterranean will
thoroughly understand; for there is
no noisier or more aggravating sea-shore
than that which is poetically
the tideless, waveless, sapphire-like
mirror of the old Tyrrhenian. In
this house I soon made out my
friend&mdash;a white dog with black
points, shaven to the shoulders, and
of Spitz breed, as his tail, put on
very high up, and twisted with a
jaunty, self-asserting <em>swirl</em> over his
back, denoted, but with an undoubted
bar sinister in his shield&mdash;some
English spaniel or terrier "drop,"
which, strange to say, gave him a
power of persistence, a dauntless
courage, and loving faithfulness, such
as I never saw in any dog before;
and yet I know about dogs and
dog ways, too.</p>

<p>The first thing my friend did&mdash;his
name was Cicarello, abbreviated to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Cico, and anglicized to Chick&mdash;was
to lift himself up very high on his toes,
erect every hair into a wire, and
growl so as to show all his beautiful
young white teeth at my approach
and outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"Chick! how dare you, sir? Come
along, be a good little dog, and let
me scratch your back; you don't
know how nice it is, dear!"</p>

<p>But the growling and defiant looks
continued, as Chick lay down on his
own chosen step of the stairs. I
pushed him with my foot, and said
emphatically:</p>

<p>"Chick! you're a <em>nasty</em> little
dog!" At which candid opinion,
Chick, sulkier and crosser than ever,
settled himself to sleep.</p>

<p>It was not long, however, before
Chick, like all other dogs, succumbed
to the dog mesmerism of
that hearty good-will and affection
in which dogs are apt to trust with
a much more generous confidence
than men. He began by licking my
hand, then came to my room for
water, and at last was won from his
disreputable habits of straying from
one wine-shop to another about the
town, into which he had fallen from
not being made happy and comfortable
at home. One day, he condescended
to offer himself for a walk,
and we went through sundry tortuous
lanes to some olive-terraces
above the town. Once there, the
dog's unbounded delight was pretty
to see. He rolled among the fresh
grass and hop-clover, thickly sprinkled
with lovely red <em>gladioli</em>; he careered
in and out of the olive-trees, as
if weaving some mystic, invisible
witch-web; and then, rushing back
to me, barking sharply in a high falsetto,
he sprawled at full length on
the ground, wagging his bushy plume
over his back, and saying, in the
clearest speech of his wonderful
brown eyes, "I am not a nasty little
dog <em>now</em>. Thank you for making
me so happy!"</p>

<p>My friend, whom I had long loved
with all my heart, was easily made
happy. The one thing necessary to
him was some sort of master whom
he could love. With any such, his
queer, sullen temper brightened, his
thoroughly obstinate will grew docile,
his eyes watched every motion
and indication showing his master's
wishes, and, if anything were given
into his charge, no amount of tempting
or frightening could win or scare
him from his trust. His chiefest delight
was running after a stone or
cork, in which also his ways were
special to himself. When the stone
was found or dug up&mdash;that very
stone and no other&mdash;Chick would
stand with one paw placed upon it,
looking down at it with crest and
tippet erect, and exactly as if it were
some sort of live game. If no notice
were taken of his dumb appeal,
he would snatch up the stone, and
carry it on, but always with appealing
looks to have it thrown again.
On the olive-terraces, among the
grass and wild flowers, where he always
became intensely excited, he
would run round the stone, growling,
roll upon it in a kind of frenzy, and
snap at every one who came near.
When I gravely called or spoke to
him, he would relinquish this <em>Berserk</em>
mood, and, wagging his brush, lick
my hand as if to beg pardon for
such childishness, and return to the
decent sobrieties of ordinary life. I
need scarcely say that it was only
because the over-excitement was bad
for himself that he was ever controlled
in his fancies and conceits;
for dogs, even more than children,
should be allowed to express their
own character and make their own
happiness, in unimportant things, in
their own way.</p>

<p>Chick attached himself to me in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the most persistent way. He took
walks with me, scratched at the
room doors to be where I was, ran
up and down stairs after me on every
errand, used my room, like the dogs
at home, as the "United Dogs' Service,"
and slept on a chair at the
foot of my bed. Even when left at
the church door during daily Mass,
when I vainly thought him securely
pent within gates and rails, the padded
door would be shoved open,
and Chick, with his ears and twisted
tail</p>

<p class="center">"Cocked fu' sprush,"
</p>

<p>and his whole bearing that of "the
right man in the right place," would
scuttle over the stone pavement,
scent me out, and ensconce himself
beside my chair. At meals he took
his seat beside me, in which he
would rear himself up unbidden in
the drollest way, lolling back with
perfect ease, and gracefully holding
one forepaw higher than the other,
as if addressing the party. Sometimes
he would even emphasize his
remarks by bringing one paw down
on the table, and, amid the shouts of
laughter he occasioned, would look
us steadily in the face, as if enjoying
the joke as well as the rest. He
learnt to sit up with a shawl round
him, a napkin-ring on his nose, and
one crowning his head; to hold
biscuit on his nose untouched till
bidden to eat, and even to stand
quite upright in the corner, watching
with the gravest intelligence till he
was told to come out. In short, as
I said before, if the one motive-power
of love were found, Chick's genius
seemed to know no limit.</p>

<p>But, meanwhile, the day was drawing
near when the deep and most
real grief must be suffered of leaving
my friend. Our temporary rest was
over, and our faces were bound to
be turned towards home. Chick,
also, took good note of the preparations
for departure, and I read in his
eyes that he guessed their import,
and knew that our separation was
drawing near. Never for an instant
would he let me move out of his
sight, except for Mass, when I locked
him up in my room. His exceeding
joy at my return was one of
the most touching things I ever felt.
When every other demonstration had
been made, he would get up on his
hind legs, and gently lick my face,
not as a dog usually does, but just
putting out his tongue, and touching
my cheek. This special act always
seemed to say, "<em>Can</em> you go away
and leave me behind? Why not
take me with you?"</p>

<p>The consciousness of this feeling
wrought so strongly that the question
was seriously mooted between my
friend and me of buying Chick and
carrying him with us to England.
But there were great difficulties in the
way. The expense was no small
addition, besides the anxiety and
added fatigue of another fresh thing
to lead about and struggle for in
stations and waiting-rooms, being,
as we were, only a party of women,
neither strong nor well, and already
burdened with a superfluity of luggage
and <em>impedimenta</em>. So the
mournful decision was come to that
it could not be. Our last walks
were taken, our last gambols on the
olive-terraces played out, and it
seemed to me as if every hour
Chick's eyes became more tenderly
loving and more devotedly faithful.
And soon I should be far out of
reach and ken, while he must be left
in the careless, indifferent, <em>dog-ignorant</em>
hands to which he belonged.
Doubtless the many well-read and
cultivated people who are in the
habit of reading this periodical have
already set me down as a remarkably
foolish person; but what will they
say when I confess there were mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>ments
when the very thought of
leaving Chick without certain bed
and board, water at will, and sympathy
in his ways and love, made me
weep real, scalding tears, and not a
few?</p>

<p>Out of the very abundance of
thoughts and pain some light appeared;
and one fine day, when the
heat was fierce, I put on my hat,
Chick took up a stone, and we both
made our way to a large villa in
the neighborhood, occupied by a
family from Wales, whose acquaintance
we had happily made: what
sort of people they were the story
of my friend will show, at least to
those, in my eyes, the truest aristocracy
of the world&mdash;the people
who have an inbred love of dogs!
On this visit, I remarked that Chick,
instead of walking on his toes and
wiring his hair as he usually did with
strangers, accepted the whole party
as friends, and showed off all his
stock of accomplishments with as
much docility as if we had been at
home by ourselves. On the other
side, Mr. and Mrs. Griffith&mdash;as I
shall call them&mdash;thoroughly appreciated
the dog, and, seeing this, I
made my proposition&mdash;an unblushing
one, considering that they had already
rescued two other dogs from ill
usage&mdash;that they should also possess
themselves of Chick. Having once
broken the ice, I launched into a moving
description of his wretched plight,
and greater misery when we should
have gone, as well as the reward
they would reap from Chick's delightful
ways. They laughingly took
it all in good part, and said, if they
had not already an Italian Spitz
which they had sent home, and a
dancing dog just brought on their
hands, they might have thought of
Chick. I took poor Chickie home,
therefore, with a heavy heart, though
I did not yet give up all hope; and,
because I did not, I put him under
S. Anthony's care, and asked <em>him</em> to
suggest to these dear people to buy
Chick and give him a happy home.</p>

<p>The eve of our departure was a few
days after this, and, when Chick followed
me up-stairs to bed as usual,
I took him in my arms, and told
him I was going away; that nothing
on earth should ever have
made me leave him but the being
obliged to do so; that I had
put him under S. Anthony's care,
who I was sure would find him a
friend; and that he must be a good,
brave little dog, and hold on for
the present without running away.
Chick licked away my tears, looking
at me with his brave brown eyes
full of trust, as I kissed him over and
over again before going to bed. But
afterwards I could never tell how
many more tears I shed at leaving
Chick friendless and alone.</p>

<p>The next morning very early, I
wrote a last appeal to Mrs. Griffith,
which I carried out to the post myself,
that it might be sure to reach
her; and then the carriage came to
the door, and we drove away, seeing
Chick to the last on the door-step,
sorrowfully looking after us with
his steady brown eyes.</p>

<p>It was a long time before I myself
learnt the second chapter of
my dear friend's story. Mrs. Griffith
duly got the note, and, being much
touched by it, she went to the boarding-house
to call on me, thinking
that I had been left behind for a
week, not yet recovered from an
illness, and also wishing to get
another view of Chick. Neither of
these objects being gained, she returned
home with a strong feeling "borne
in" upon her mind that Chick must
be rescued at any inconvenience to
themselves. Not long afterwards,
she and her husband were asked by
the owner of the boarding-house to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
go and look at it, as she wished to
sell or let it on lease. They both
accordingly went, chiefly with a view
to seeing Chick. After a long visit
and much conversation, Mrs. Griffith
did at length see the poor little dog
lying panting in the sun in the garden,
where there was not an atom of
shade. She called the attention of
the owner to him, and told her that
the dog was suffering and in great
want of water. His mistress made
some careless reply as usual, and
passed on, still talking, down the
stairs, when, at the front door, Mrs.
Griffith chanced to look down into
the court, and there saw poor little
Chick stretched on his back in the
violent convulsions of a fit. She
hastily summoned her husband, who,
after one glance, vanished into the
lower regions, instinctively found a
pump and a large pan, and reappeared
to drench the poor little dog with
a cold-water bath, strongly remonstrating
with his owner the while
that any one with eyes or ears could
have seen how suffering the animal
had been from heat and thirst.</p>

<p>Ah! Chickie! Chickie! did any
thought cross your dog's mind then
of the "United Dogs' Service" of my
room? Alas! when I heard of it,
how did I not feel for my dear little
friend, proclaiming by every mute
appeal his urgent need, and bravely
suffering on in silence near to death,
while not a hand was lifted to give
him even the cup of cold water
which brings with the gift its reward!
By dint of much bathing and rubbing
for nearly an hour from Mr. and
Mrs. Griffith, while his owner looked
on in stupid amazement at this waste
of time and trouble on "only a dog,"
Chick recovered breath and life
and was able to take some physic
administered by the same kind
hands. And then, at last, an agreement
was entered into that he should
be made over to these generous
friends on certain conditions, one of
which was that he should be left to
guard the house where he was for
the present; for though much was
not given to my poor little friend,
much was required from him by his
wretched masters.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards, Mrs. Griffith
felt restless and uneasy, and told
her husband she should like to have
Chick in their possession before the
time stipulated; for she felt afraid he
might come under the fresh police
regulations for putting an end to all
stray dogs during the raging heat.
Mr. Griffith laughed at her "fidgets,"
but went to the boarding-house,
nevertheless, to comply with her
wishes. He was met at the door
with the announcement that Chick
had run away, and had not been
heard of for two days! Grieved and
completely disgusted at the heartless
neglect which had again driven the
poor dog from his so-called home,
Mr. Griffith hurried back to his
wife with the news, and she, like the
true woman and mother she is, sat
down and burst into tears. Mr.
Griffith caught up his hat, and hurried
out to the police, set several
Italian boys whom he taught, and
who loved him well, to search everywhere
for the missing Chick, and did
not return to his own house till late,
completely worn out with the heat
and worry.</p>

<p>Some time later, he was told that
one of his Italian boys had come, and
was asking to see him; and, as soon
as he was ordered in, the boy, who
knew what pain he was giving, sorrowfully
told his news that the police
had seized upon the "bravo Cico"&mdash;the
half-shaven dog whom everybody
knew and loved&mdash;"and...."</p>

<p>"Well, and where is he?" cried
Mrs. Griffith, her husband, and the
child in one breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! signora, Cico è morto!"
(Cico is dead).</p>

<p>"Dead! How do you know?
Where?"</p>

<p>"Signora, the police take the dogs
they find to the Mola (breakwater),
and, if they are not claimed before
the next night, they make away with
them. Ah! Cico was a bravo, bravo
canino!" (a brave little dog).</p>

<p>Looking at his wife's face, Mr.
Griffith quickly despatched the boy,
and, once more taking up his hat,
this brave and good man again
sought the police office, where the
news was confirmed that Chick was
dead. Still hoping against hope,
Mr. Griffith said, "There are many
white and black dogs; I should like
to see his dead body."</p>

<p>This, backed by other <em>arguments</em>,
admitted of no demur. The foreign
English lord must be humored
in his whim, and he should be conducted
to the poor dead Chickie's
dungeon. On the way, Mr. Griffith
amazed his wife by rushing into their
house like a "fire-flaught," calling out
for a piece of cold meat and a roll
and butter "as quick as possible!"</p>

<p>"But Chickie's dead&mdash;the poor
dog's dead!" she began. But he
waved his hand and vanished, running
down the street with his coat flying in
the wind. He, too, almost flew across
the reach of sand and driftwood to the
Mola, and up to the prison door of
the dark, airless, filthy hole into which
poor little Chick had been thrust, like
a two-legged criminal guilty of some
horrible crime, from the last Saturday
afternoon till this present Monday
night. Not a single drop of water
had been vouchsafed him; but
the fiendish cruelty which characterizes
people ignorant of the habits and
sufferings of animals, while denying
the dog this one necessary, had instigated
the police to leave him a large
piece of poisoned meat.</p>

<p>"Signore," said a magisterial voice
from among the idle crowd which
had gathered to see what miracles the
English lord was going to work&mdash;"signore,
if the dog will not eat, he
is mad, and you must not take him
away!" And a lump of hard, mouldy
black bread was thrown down before
the seemingly lifeless body of poor
little Chick, who of course made no
sign.</p>

<p>"E matto! E matto!" (he is mad)
cried many voices.</p>

<p>"Chickie! Chickie! dear little doggie,
come and speak to me!" cried
Mr. Griffith, who was nearly beside
himself at the bare sight of what the
bright, happy little creature had become,
and the thought of what his
sufferings had been. Chickie heard
the voice, recognized his kind helper,
opened his eyes, and, feebly dragging
himself up from the ground, came
forward a step or two towards the
door, which caused a general stir of
dread and horror among the spectators,
and made the police half
close the door, lest the terrible monster
should break loose upon them.
Mr. Griffith forced himself into the
opening, and threw his bit of cold
meat to Chick; but he had suffered too
much to be able to eat it, and turned
from it with disgust, though he feebly
wagged his brush in acknowledgment
to his kind friend. Almost in despair,
but calling the dog by every coaxing,
caressing name he could think of, Mr.
Griffith then held out to him a morsel
of well-buttered roll, and, again
wagging his brush, Chick smelt at it,
took it, and ate the whole of it in the
presence of the august crowd.</p>

<p>Mr. Griffith felt that he could throw
up his hat, or dance for joy, or misbehave
in any other way which was
most unbecoming to a staid country
gentleman; but all he actually did
was to pull a piece of cord quickly
out of his pocket, and say, "I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
take the dog home with me now,
can't I?"</p>

<p>"You can take him to the owner,
signore. And on payment of ten
francs to the police" (for the
poisoned meat?), "and with the
owner's consent, the dog will be
yours."</p>

<p>The prison door was then opened
a little wider for the cord to be tied
round Chick's neck, when, behold!
he spied the moment of escape, and,
refreshed with his morsel of roll, and
not knowing what more the cruelty
of man would devise, the plucky little
dog rushed through the crowd, and
raced along the shore to the town
as hard as he could go, Mr. Griffith
after him at the top of his speed, to
a certain low wine-shop, where also
Chick had a true friend. And there
Mr. Griffith found him, after drinking
nearly a bucketful of water, in the
convulsions of another and most terrible
fit! His generous friend carried
him home in his arms, tucked up his
sleeves and gave him a warm bath,
physicked him, nursed him, washed
and combed the vermin of his loathsome
prison-hole from him, and, with
untiring pains and a love that never
wearied, brought the brave little doggie
back to life and health.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The story of my friend is told.
Chick's last appearance in his native
town was when making a triumphal
progress through it in a carriage with
his master and mistress; he sitting
up on his hind legs in his old fashion,
lolling back against the carriage-cushion
with one paw raised, while
every man and boy they met saluted
the English lord and lady with
lifted hats and delighted cries of
"Cico! Cicarello! Bravo! bravo canino!"
Chick was eventually brought
home to England by that best of
masters whom S. Anthony had found
for him, to whom he has attached
himself so devotedly that nothing but
force will induce him to leave him by
night or day. And that master and
I are of one mind&mdash;that a braver,
cleverer, more loving, or more faithful
dog could never be found.</p>

<h3>THE LOVE OF GOD.</h3>


<p>The chief thing that is to be regarded
in him that doth anything, is
the will and love wherewithal he
doeth it. O Redeemer of the world!
although thou has done much for
us, and given us great gifts, and
hast delivered us from many mischiefs,
and hast promised us thy
eternal and everlasting bliss, yet is
all this, being so much that it maketh
one astonished and afraid, far
less than the love that thou bearest
us. For love thou gavest thyself
unto us: thou camest down from
heaven, thou tookest flesh, and
diest; and through the unspeakable
love that thou borest us, thou hast
created and redeemed us, and gavest
thyself unto us in the Blessed
Sacrament of the Eucharist, and deliveredst
us from so many evils, and
promisest us so great goods. Thy
love is of such force towards us, that
the least favors that thou doest us,
coming polished with such singular
fine love, we are never able to be
sufficiently thankful for it, nor to requite,
although we should thrust ourselves
into flaming furnaces for love
of thee.&mdash;<em>Southwell.</em></p>

<h3>A FRENCH POET.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></h3>


<p>It is often said among those who
assert much and investigate little
that the control of science, of literature,
and of art has passed beyond the
domain of the ancient church, that
her children have given up the contest,
and that she no longer produces
distinguished men. It seems to be
an understood thing that sound Catholicism
is not consistent with proficiency
in any branch of the higher pursuits,
and that every artist, scientist,
and <i lang="fr">littérateur</i> ceases to be a good
Christian in proportion as he is successful
in his profession. There has
been some apparent excuse for such
an impression gaining ground, but it
is none the less an erroneous impression.
Especially of late years has it
been triumphantly refuted, and nowhere
with more <i lang="fr">éclat</i> than in the very
stronghold, the <i lang="la">sanctum sanctorum</i>
of free thought and private judgment&mdash;England.
There has arisen in
that land of successful and jubilant
materialism, that citadel of rationalism
in matters of religion, a knot of
men formidable for their learning,
their eloquence, their taste, and their
wit. But if even in England, under
the shadow that was yet left hanging
over the church from the effects of
three hundred years of repression,
the vitality of the old "olive-tree"<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
was amply proved by the grafting
in and prosperous growth of so many
new branches, still more was the fruitfulness
of the ancient mother and
mistress of all knowledge shown
forth in Catholic France. That country
has suffered sorely; it has been
the experimental plaything of the
world, it has been torn by unchristian
politicians, gagged by Cæsarism,
drenched in blood by demagogism;
it has been deluged with a literature
as shameless as it was attractive, until
the name of France has become identified
in the minds of many with deliberate
and organized immorality. It
is asserted that the names of her
most famous novelists are synonymes
of licentiousness; that her philosophers
openly preach the grossest materialism;
and that those of her <i lang="fr">littérateurs</i>
who are not absolute libertines are undisguised
Sybarites. Never was country
so thoroughly and deplorably misrepresented
as this Catholic land,
whence have come three-fourths of
the missionaries of the world, armies
of Sisters of Charity, the most impetuous
and the bravest of the Pope's defenders,
the most indefatigable scientific
explorers, the purest of political
reformers. If France must be judged
by her literature, she can point to
Montalembert, Ozanam, Albert de
Broglie, Eugénie de Guérin, Louis
Veuillot, Dupanloup, Rio, Lacordaire,
Mme. Craven, Pontmartin, La
Morvonnais, as well as to Balzac,
Dumas, Eugène Sue, George Sand,
and Alfred de Musset. If by her
art, De la Roche, Ary Scheffer, Hippolyte
Flandrin, vindicate her old
Catholic historical pre-eminence; if
by her science and her philosophy,
there are Ampère, Berryer, Villemain,
even Cousin. Everywhere the old
sap is coursing freely, and in the
ranks of all professions are champions
ready to do battle for the old faith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
that made France a "<i lang="fr">grande nation</i>."
But those we have mentioned, especially
the distinguished and brilliant
cluster, Montalembert, de Broglie,
Lacordaire, and Dupanloup, had eschewed
the old legitimist traditions,
and, without detracting from their
fame, we may say that they were eminently
men of the XIXth century.
The charm and poetry of chivalry,
fidelity to an exiled race, the spell
of the white flag and the golden
<i lang="fr">fleur-de-lis</i>, were in their minds things
of the past; noble and beautiful weapons,
it is true, but useless for the
present emergency, like the enamelled
armor and jewelled daggers which
we reverently admire in our national
museums. The old monarchical traditions
needed a champion in the
field of literature where their conscientious
and respectful opponents
were so brilliantly represented, and
this they found in Jean Reboul, the
subject of this memoir.</p>

<p>One would have thought that the
legitimist poet would have arisen
from some lonely castle of Brittany,
and have borne a name which twenty
generations of mediæval heroes had
made famous in song. One would
have pictured him as the melancholy,
high-spirited descendant of Crusaders,
orphaned by the Vendean war, inspired
by the influence of the ocean
and the majestic solitude of the
<em>landes</em>.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>He would be likely to be a Christian
Byron, a modern Ossian, far
removed from contact with the
world, almost a prophet as well as a
poet. But as if to render his
personality more marked, and his
partisanship more striking, the
champion of legitimacy was none of
these things. Instead of being a
noble, he was a baker; instead of
a solitary, a busy man of the world&mdash;even
a deputy in the French Assembly
in 1840. Who would have
dreamt this? Yet when God chose
a king for Israel, he did not call a
man of exalted family to the throne,
but "a son of Jemini of the least
tribe of Israel, and his kindred the
last among all the families of the
tribe of Benjamin."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> So it fell out
with the representative who, among
the constellation of more than
ordinary brilliancy which marked
the beginning of this century in
France, was to uphold the old
political faith of the land. There
was doubtless some wise reason for
this singular and unexpected choice.
Reboul was a man of the people, a
worker for his bread, that it might
be known what the people could do
when led by faith and loyalty; he was
from Nîmes, in the south of France,
not far from Lyons and Marseilles,
that his attitude might be a perpetual
protest against the wave of communism
and revolution which had its
source in the south; he was, so to
speak, a descendant of the Romans&mdash;for
Nîmes was a flourishing
Roman colony and its people are
said to retain much of the massiveness
of the Roman character&mdash;that he
might rebuke the mistaken notion
of those who make of the old republic
a type of modern anarchy, and desecrate
the names of Lucretia and
Cornelia by bestowing them on the
<em>tricoteuses</em><a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> of 1793, or the <em>pétroleuses</em>
of 1870. It must have been a
special consolation to the exiled
representative of the Bourbons, the
object of such devoted and romantic
loyalty, to follow the successes and
receive the outspoken sympathy of
so unexpected and so staunch an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>adherent. Uncompromising in his
championship of the "<i lang="fr">drapeau blanc</i>,"
Reboul was politically a host in himself,
and, untrammelled as he was
by the traditions and prejudices that
hedged in the nobles of the party,
he was able to mingle with all classes,
speak to all men, treat with all parties,
and yet to carry his allegiance
through all obstacles, unimpaired and
even unsuspected.</p>

<p>Jean Reboul was born at Nîmes
on the 23d of January, 1796. His
father was a locksmith and in very
modest circumstances. His mother
was early left a widow, with four
young children to provide for. Jean,
who was the eldest, and of an equally
thoughtful and energetic character,
soon contrived to relieve her of the
anxieties of her position, by establishing
himself in business as a baker.
Whatever ambitious and vague longings
he might have had even at that
early period we do not know, but
can easily guess at, and his sacrifice of
them already endears the future poet
to our hearts. How he ever after
preferred the claims of his family to
his own convenience, and refused to
take from them the security which his
lowly trade gave them, and which
the precarious success of a literary
career might have taken away, we
shall see later on. But Reboul did
not forego his poetical aspirations; he
published various detached pieces
in the local journals of Nîmes, he
circulated MS. poems among his
friends, and his name began to be
well known at least in his native
town. It was not till 1820, however,
that the outside world and the literary
assemblies of Paris knew him.
He gave half his day to the labor
of his trade and half to intellectual
work and hard study, and the
activity of his character, as well as
the rigorous measurement of his time,
so arranged as never to waste a
moment, made this division of labor
prejudicial to neither one employment
nor the other.</p>

<p>In physique he was tall, athletic,
and stately enough for a Roman senator.
His features were cast in a large
and massive mould, his dark, brilliant
eyes were full of meridional fire, and his
abundant black hair seemed a fitting
frame for his manly, fearless countenance.
Even in old age and when
dying, a friend and admirer recorded
that "his face has suffered no contraction,
but has wholly kept the
purity of those sculptural lineaments
so nobly reproduced by the chisel
of Pradier; it even seemed to have
borrowed a new and graver majesty
from the dread approach of
death; ... even death appeared, as it were, to
hesitate to touch his form, and seemed
to draw near its victim with the
deepest respect." His vigorous life,
his active intelligence, his inflexible
uprightness of character&mdash;everything
seemed to point him out as a man
beyond the common run of even
good men. We shall see his character
as developed in the admirable letters
which form the basis of this
sketch. Type of a Christian patriot,
he towers above his contemporaries
by sheer nobility of soul, and is an example
of that moral stature to which
no worldly honors, no political position,
no hereditary rank can add "one
cubit." <i lang="la">Pro Deo, Patria et Rege</i> was
his lifelong motto, and it may safely
be said that if France had many such
sons, no one in the past or in the
future could have rivalled or could
hope to rival "la grande nation."</p>

<p>His first volume of collected poems
was published in 1836, and one by
one eminent men of letters, struck
by the beauty, severity, and freshness
of his diction, sought out the new
light and entered into brotherhood
with him. His lifelong friendship
with M. de Fresne, however, dated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
from 1829, when he had already published
<cite>The Angel and the Child</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> in
a Paris magazine, and other pieces
at various intervals in local periodicals.
A traveller from the capital
knocked at the unknown poet's door,
and the tie knit by the first external
homage that had yet come to Reboul,
was never dissolved. The letters
from which we draw his portrait,
as traced by himself, were all
addressed to this first friend. In
1838, another and more illustrious
visitor came to the baker's home
at Nîmes, the patriarch of revived
Christian literature in France, the
immortal Châteaubriand. He tells
the story of his visit himself:</p>

<p>"I found him in his bakery, and
spoke to him without knowing to
whom I was speaking, not distinguishing
him from his companions
in the trade of Ceres; he took my
name, and said he would see if the
person I wanted was at home. He
came back presently and smilingly
made himself known to me. He
took me through his shop, where we
groped about in a labyrinth of flour-sacks,
and at last climbed by a sort
of ladder into a little retreat (<em>réduit</em>)
something like the chamber of a
windmill. There we sat down and
talked. I was as happy as in my
barn in London,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and much happier
than in my minister's chair in Paris."</p>

<p>Reboul was an ardent Catholic,
an uncompromising "ultramontane,"
as their enemies designate those who
refuse to render unto Cæsar the
things that are God's. He took a
keen and sensitive interest in the
struggles of religion against infidelity,
the prototypes, or rather the counterparts,
of those we see now waging in
Italy and Germany. On the occasion
of one of these attacks on the church
in 1844, he writes these trenchant
words:</p>

<p>"The sword is drawn between the
religious and the political power: if
I were not a Frenchman before being
a royalist, and a Catholic before
a Frenchman, I should find much to
rejoice at in this check to the hopes
of a certain part of the episcopate who
honestly believed in the reign of religious
freedom, on the word of the
revolutionists. But, good people!
if revolution were not despotism, it
would not be revolution."</p>

<p>The unity of the church struck
him as immeasurably grand. Speaking
of the great Spanish convert Donoso-Cortes
and his religious works,
he says:</p>

<p>"What a marvellous faith it is
which makes men situated at such
distances of time and place think
exactly alike on the most difficult
and deepest subjects!"</p>

<p>A most striking passage in his
writings is the following opinion on
the Reformation:</p>

<p>"Forgive my outspokenness," he
writes to his friend M. de Fresne, "if
my opinion differs totally from yours.
No, the Reformation was <em>not</em> an outburst
of holy and generous indignation
against abuses and infamies.
This indignation possessed all the
eminent and virtuous men <em>in</em> the
church, but it was not to be found
among the reformers. The Reformation,
on the contrary, came to legalize
corruption and bend the precepts
of the Gospel to the exigencies of
the flesh. Luther was literally the
Mahomet of the West. Both acted
through the sword: the one established
polygamy, the other divorce, a
species of polygamy far more fatal
to morals than polygamy proper.
If you would know what the Reformation
really was, look at its founders
and abettors, and see if chastity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
was dear to them. Henry VIII.
married six wives, of whom he divorced
two and executed two more;
Zwinglius took a wife, Beza took a
wife, Calvin took a wife, Luther
took a wife, the landgrave of Hesse
wished to take a second wife during
the lifetime of his first, and Luther
authorized him to do so. The
caustic Erasmus, whose Catholicism
was not very strict, could not
help saying that the Reformation
was a comedy like many others,
where everything ended with marriages.
The real reformers of the
church, those who reformed her
not according to the gospel of passion,
but the Gospel of Jesus Christ,
were S. Charles Borromeo, S. John
of the Cross, S. Teresa, S. Ignatius
Loyola, and thousands of holy
priests and bishops."</p>

<p>Not to weary the reader by constant
comments on the text which
reveals this great Christian thinker's
mind, we will append the following
significant quotations from his letters
with as few breaks as possible.
They are gathered from a collection
extending over a period of more than
thirty years:</p>

<p>"The secrets of the church are
ruled by a divine order, and to judge
of them according to merely human
fears or prudence, is to mistake the
nature of the church, and to ignore
her past. Time takes upon itself
the vindication of decisions arrived
at by a legitimate authority, even
though it be a temporal one; ...
truth will come to the surface, and
is often manifested by the very men
apparently most earnest in combating
it.... I believe this work
(a religious publication of M. de
Broglie) is an event, as much because
of the author's character and
the principles which his name is understood
to represent, as because of
the epoch of its publication. This
frank confession in the belief of the
supernatural in the teeth of the public
rationalistic teaching of the day&mdash;ever
striving to wrap Christ in its own
shroud of philosophical verbiage and
to bury him in the grave from which
he had risen&mdash;makes us pray to God
and praise him, ... that <em>his kingdom
may come</em>.... The struggle nowadays
is between God made man, and
man making himself God.... I
wonder that you take the trouble to
break your head thinking about
these German dreamers (atheists);
for my part, I gave orders long ago
to the door-keeper of my brain,
if any of these gentleman should
ask for me, to say that I was '<em>not at
home</em>.' These old errors served up
with the new sauce of a worse darkness
than before seem to me very
indigestible.</p>

<p>"Genius which devotes itself to
evil, far from being a glory, is but a
gigantic infamy. Plato is right when
he calls it a fatal industry.</p>

<p>"The French Revolution has done
in the political world what the Reformation
did in the religious world;
it has taken from reason her leaning
staff, and reason, trying to stand
alone, has caused the things we have
seen&mdash;and so, alas! at this moment,
the Revolution cries out for a principle,
but is itself the negation of all
principle."</p>

<p>In politics, as we have seen, Reboul
was a staunch legitimist, but
a shrewd observer. He was no
dreamer, though his belief in the
ancient Bourbons was with him a
perfect <i lang="la">cultus</i>. He never swerved
from the road which he had traced
for himself. As a poet, his native
city was proud of him, France held
out every honor to him, fellow-<i lang="fr">littérateurs</i>
of all shades of opinion welcomed
him as a brother, governments
flattered him, the people
looked up to him. Had he been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
ambitious, civic and parliamentary
honors were ready for him; had he
been venal, his career might have
been brilliant, lucrative, and idle.
In 1844, the mayor of Nîmes, M.
Girard, proposed to him a change
of occupation, offering him the position
of town-librarian, as more suited
to his tastes than the trade he followed.
He was assured that this
appointment would entail no political
obligation, that perfect independence
of speech and action would be
guaranteed to him, but, says M. de
Poujoulat: "Reboul, intent above
all on the services he could render
the cause among his own surroundings,
and solicitous of hedging in the
dignity of his life with the most
spotless integrity, refused the mayor's
offer. He did not even seek to
make a merit of his refusal; his
friends knew nothing of it; M. de
Fresne alone was in the secret, and
it was not divulged till years after."
The Cross of the Legion of Honor
was twice offered him: once by
the government of Louis Philippe,
through the agency of the minister
M. de Salvandy, who was fond
of seeking out honest and independent
talent, but the loyal poet
answered briefly: "He who alone
has the right to decorate me is not in
France"; and again by the empire,
when it was urged that the decoration
was a homage such as might
have been respectfully offered in
<i lang="fr">les Arènes</i> (the Roman amphitheatre
at Nîmes). Reboul proudly yet
playfully replied that "he had not
yet quite reached the state of a
monument," and feeling plenty of vitality
left in him, did not need the
red ribbon. He explains to his
friend M. de Fresne that he asked
the God of S. Louis to enlighten his
perplexities, to lift his soul above all
small vanities, to deliver him from
political rancor, if he harbored any,
and to guide him to a decision which
would leave him at peace with himself.
"I have not the presumption,"
he adds, "to think that I received
an inspiration from above, but I believe
in the efficacy of prayer. I
know not if I was heard, but at any
rate I did my best."</p>

<p>There is a grand Christian simplicity
in this, which marks Reboul
as a man far beyond the average.
Nothing dazzles him, because he always
has the glory of God before his
eyes. His friend M. de Poujoulat
says of him:</p>

<p>"I find in Reboul a penetrating
and serious good sense, broad views,
as it were luminous sheaves of
thought; I see in him an unprejudiced
and discriminating observer of
the affairs of his day. The noise of
popularity is not glory, and the
stature our contemporaries make for
us is not our true one, but one raised
by artifice and conventionality.
Here was a man who looked down
from the height of his solitude, said
what he thought, and in his judgment
forestalled the verdict of posterity.
Reboul was interested in the
individual works of his day, but he
had only scant admiration for the
age that produced them. His conscience
was the measure of his appreciation
both of men and events,
and it was a measure hardly advantageous
to them."</p>

<p>In 1836, a few of his friends clubbed
together to offer him at least a pension,
in the name of "an exile" (the Comte
de Chambord), but he refused even this
with touching disinterestedness, saying:
"There is but one hand on earth
from which I should not blush to
accept a gift: the representative of
Providence on earth. The gifts of this
hand increase the honor and independence
of the recipient, and bind
him to nothing save the public weal,
but adverse circumstance having seal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>ed
this fount of honor, I could not
dream of drawing aught from it, for
<i lang="fr">l'exil a besoin de ses miettes</i>,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and it is
rather our duty to contribute to its
needs than to draw on it for our
own." Later, when pressing necessity
made it incumbent upon him to
accept help from his friends and his
sovereign, as he loyally called the
exiled Comte de Chambord, it was
so great a sorrow to him that he could
scarcely enjoy the material benefit
of such help. The poor and faithful
poet had "dreamed of leaving
earth with the memory of a devotion
wholly gratuitous," and was sincerely
grieved because it could not be so.
He received several letters from the
Comte de Chambord and his wife,
some written in their own hand,
others by their secretary, and he addressed
himself several times to these
objects of his <i lang="la">cultus</i> in terms of
impassioned yet dignified loyalty.
Henri V. fully appreciated his homage,
and treated him as a friend rather
than a stranger. Reboul visited
the royal family at Frohsdorf, their
Austrian retreat, and received the
most flattering marks of attention.
To him it was not a visit so much as
a pilgrimage; his devotion to the
person of his sovereign was but the
embodiment of his principle of fealty
towards hereditary monarchy. Speaking
of the Requiem Mass celebrated
at Nîmes, in October, 1851, on the
occasion of the death of the Duchesse
d'Angoulême, daughter of Louis
XVI., he says:</p>

<p>"She had made a deep impression,
and left durable memories among the
working classes of our town, on her
passage through Nîmes some years
ago.... The people, my dear
friend, the Christian people, recognizes
better than <i lang="fr">les beaux-esprits</i> what
true greatness is, and is ever ready to
bow before the majesty of a nobly-borne
sorrow. No orator could adequately
describe the appearance of
our church to-day. This great gathering
<i lang="fr">en blouse ou en veste</i>,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> these
faces browned by toil and want, bore
an expression of nobility and gravity
fully suitable to such an occasion....
When one still has such courtiers, is
exile a reality?"</p>

<p>Reboul would never allow that the
irregularities of its representatives
were enough of themselves to condemn
a system. We have seen how,
while recognizing the degeneracy of
many churchmen in the XVIth century,
he yet denounced the pretended
reformers who sought this pretext
for attacking the church, and in politics
his judgments were equally clear
and impartial. "If," he says, "it is
still possible to be a republican despite
the Reign of Terror, it is not
impossible to be a royalist despite a
few moral deviations which have disgraced
some of our kings. Was the
<em>Directoire</em> (a genuine republican product)
an assembly of Josephs? And
the houses of our day&mdash;are they not
of glass? It is not wise, therefore, to
be incessantly throwing stones....
After all, I return to my original argument:
notwithstanding the shadows
which darken the great qualities and
high virtues of many of our kings,
can you find anything better?"</p>

<p>Reboul's political faith is traced at
length in the following paragraph,
which may be called statesmanlike,
since it contains a theory of government:
"The sovereign is by all
means a <em>responsible</em> agent, but I add
to this, that the people also, when it
makes itself sovereign, is equally responsible.
The habit of thought
which separates the one from the
other is one of the misfortunes of our
times. Without <em>sovereignty</em> there can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
be no nation, nor even a people.
There remains but an agglomeration
of individuals. When I say <em>sovereign</em>
you know, if you understand the language
of politics, that I mean any
legitimate form of government. This
is applicable to all governments. Be
sure that it is nonsense to talk of a
nation as making its own sovereign.
A "nation" which as yet has no
sovereignty is no more a nation than
a body without its head is a real
body."</p>

<p>Reboul not only believed in sovereignty,
but in an aristocracy as a
necessary part of a sound national
system. Commenting upon a political
article by M. de Villemain, he
gives his ideas thus: "He is mistaken
if he believes, as he says he does, that
a people can enjoy freedom without
an <em>aristocracy</em>, or, if this word is too
much of a bugbear in the ears of our
age, without an intermediate class between
the sovereign and the people.
Equality is a fine thing, but revolutionary
journalists must make up their
minds that equality can only be arrived
at by the raising of one man
and the lowering of all the rest. It is
almost a truism to say so, but these
truisms are not bad things in politics,
being so often borne out by experience,
and, alas! by the convulsions
of empires."</p>

<p>Our poet and politician could be
witty when he liked, and, had he not
been so earnest a Christian, his satirical
humor would have been more
often exercised on those from whom
he differed so widely in opinion. This
humor crops out sometimes, as when,
on the occasion of an agricultural
show (no very congenial fête to a
man of his stamp), he quaintly says:
"I do not demur to any rational
encouragement given to agriculture,
but I fancy Sully, to whom it owes
so much, would not have been quite
so extravagant in the choice of honors
such as are now heaped upon it. A
public and gratuitous show, convocation
of the Academy, the municipal
council, the prefect of the department,
all that fuss for the coronation
of a few dumb animals! Do you
not see in this a providential sarcasm&mdash;a
people allowed to crown swine
after uncrowning its kings!"</p>

<p>A significant prophecy is contained
in the last words of the following
paragraph: "I begin to doubt the
efficacy of all these intellectual struggles;
our times need a stronger logic
than that of pamphlets, and I fear
(God forgive me for the despairing
thought)&mdash;I fear that some great misfortune
alone is capable of curing
France." How terrible the cure was
when it came we all know, but we
have yet to see whether it has been
efficient.</p>

<p>His brief career as deputy to the
Constituent Assembly in 1848 derives
a peculiar interest for the reader
by reason of the seeming contradiction
it presents to his settled political
creed. But Reboul judged things
by a higher standard than that of
party prejudice. "A Frenchman before
a royalist," he vindicated his
patriotism by active measures in those
stormy days when more voices were
needed to speak for the right in the
councils of the nation. No doubt,
with his unfailing discernment, he saw
the incongruity of his actual position
as a man of the people with that refusal
of office which was in a certain
sense becoming&mdash;nay, required&mdash;in a
legitimist of noble birth. He says of
his nomination: "I had firmly refused
before, being certain of my own
incompetency, but our population
would not hear reason. These good
people imagine that, because one
can scribble verses, one can therefore
represent a borough. I was not able
to disabuse them; it was made a
question of honor and patriotism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
and how could I refuse any longer?
Here am I, therefore, who have always
lived far from political gatherings,
I a man of retirement and study,
thrown into your whirlpool without
well knowing what will happen to me
there."</p>

<p>He was not happy as a deputy.
M. de Poujoulat says that Reboul's
countenance in those days was that
of a man bored to death. When, the
following year, he retired from these
unwonted honors, he thanked God
for "having rescued him from the
storm," and wrote to a friend: "I am
quite happy again, and do not at all
regret the honors I have left. I wonder
what interest there can be in such
heated disputes about vulgarized issues!
I never felt more at home
than I do now, and nothing whispers
to me that I have had any loss."</p>

<p>Of a young and unfortunate colleague
in the Assembly, a man who
had mistaken an irrepressible momentary
exaltation for a genuine vocation,
and from a porter had vaulted
to the position of a deputy, while he
further aspired to that of a poet,
Reboul says with grave sympathy
and sterling sense: "His blind ambition
often astounded me, but it was
so candid and so genuine that I had
not the heart to condemn it. I have
often grieved over this frank nature,
this child who, in his gambols, <em>would</em>
handle as a whip which he could use
the serpent that was to bite him.
The best thing for him would be to
go back to his trade in the teeth of
the world, and to make use of his
strength and youth; he would find
in that a truer happiness than in the
shadow of an official desk, or in the
corruptions of the literary 'Bohemia,'
but such an effort, I fear, is beyond
his strength of mind." With what
special right Reboul could give this
sound, if stern, advice, we shall see
presently.</p>

<p>In poetry Reboul's inspiration was
purely Christian, austere in its morality,
and trusting rather to the matter
than the form. He believed that the
times required a poetic censorship,
incisive, rapid, and relentless; poetry
was "the mould that God had given
him in which to cast his thoughts,"
and he felt bound to use it in season
for God's cause, without stopping to
elaborate its form and perhaps weaken
its effect. Thus it came about
that he was essentially a poet of
action, mingling with his fellow-men,
following the vicissitudes of the day
and bearing his part valiantly in the
battle of life. He was not of the
contemplative, subjective order of
poets, nor was he among the sensualists
of literature. His art was to him
neither a personal consolation, occupying
all his time and plunging
him into a selfish yet not unholy
oblivion of the world, nor yet an instrument
of gain and a pander to the
evil passions of others. It was a
mission, not simply a gift; a "talent"
to be used and to bring in five-fold
in the interests of his heavenly Master.
Many of his friends objected to
the crudity of form which sometimes
resulted from this earnest conviction,
and later in life he did set himself to
polish his style a little more. All his
verses bear this imprint of passionate
earnestness; he speaks to all, kings
and people; he tells them of their
duties in times of revolution, he
urges men to martyrdom, if need
be, that the truth may triumph; he
exalts patriotism, fidelity, and disinterestedness,
and loses no opportunity
to wrap wholesome precepts in
poetic form. His style is vigorous
and impetuous, yet domestic affections
are no strangers to his pen.
The world knows him as the author
of "The Angel and the Child,"
which has been translated into all
languages from English to Per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>sian<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
and inspired a Dresden painter
with a beautiful rendering of the song
on canvas. He says of himself:
"With me, poetry is but the veil of
philosophy," and in this he has unconsciously
followed the dictum of
a great man of the XVth century,
Savonarola, who, in his work on the
<cite>Division and Utility of all Sciences</cite>, records
the same truth: "The essence
of poetry is to be found in philosophy;
the object of poetry being to
persuade by means of that syllogism
called an example exposed with elegance
of language, so as to <em>convince</em>
and at the same time to <em>delight</em> us."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Corneille was his favorite French
poet, and his admiration for the
Christian tragedy of "Polyeucte"
prompted him to write a drama in
the same style, called the "Martyrdom
of Vivia." The scene was
placed in his own Nîmes, in the
time of the Roman Empire. The
piece was full of beauties, and above
all of enthusiasm, but, as might have
been expected, it was hardly a theatrical
success. He says himself:
"The glorification of the martyrs of
old is not a sentiment of our day";
but when "Vivia" was performed
under his own auspices in his native
town the result was far different. It
created a <em>furor</em>, and everything, even
the accessories, was perfect. Every
one vied with each other to make it
not only a success in itself, but an
ovation to the author. Reboul, when
he once saw it acted in Paris, was so
genuinely overcome by it that, leaning
across the box toward his friend
M. de Fresne, he whispered naïvely
with tears in his eyes: "I had no
idea that it was so beautiful."</p>

<p>As a poet, he utterly despised
mere popularity, and has recorded
this feeling both in verse and in
prose. In his poem "Consolation
in Forgetfulness" he asks whether
the nightingale, hidden among the
trees, seeks out first some attentive
human ear into which to pour its
ravishing strains? Nay, he answers,
but the songster gives all he has to
the night, the desert, and its silence,
and if night, desert, and silence are
alike insensible, its own great Maker
is ever at hand to listen. But it is
useless to translate winged verse into
lame prose; the next verse we will
quote in the original:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Un grand nom coûte cher dans les temps où nous sommes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Il fant rompre avec Dieu pour captiver les hommes."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The same idea is reproduced in
his correspondence:</p>

<p>"The revolution has for a long
time usurped, all over Europe, the
disposal of popularity and renown,
and, alas! how many Esaus there are
who have sold their birthright for a
mess of celebrity!... Our excellent
friend M. Le Roy had a quality
of soul capable of harmonizing with
the sad memories of fallen greatness!
Our <i lang="fr">siècle de grosse caisse</i><a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> has lost
the secret of those high and sublime
feelings which the reserve of a simple-minded
man may cover."</p>

<p>When, in 1851, his friends wished
to nominate him as a candidate for
the French Academy, the highest
literary honor possible, Reboul answered
M. de Fresne thus: "Your
kind friendship has led you astray.
What on earth would you have me do
in such a body? Though I may, in
the intimacy of private life, have
spoken to you of whatever poetic
merits I have, I am far from wishing to
declare myself seriously the rival of
the best talent of the capital. Such
pretension never entered my head.
Nay, in these days I might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
written <cite>Athalie</cite> and yet deem myself
unfit for the Academy. In revolutionary
times, things invade and
overflow each other, and nothing
is more futile than the lamentations
of literary men over the nomination
of politicians to the vacancies
of the French Academy. The revolution
has always jealously guarded
her approaches; the <em>Institut</em> is her
council." Ten years later he congratulates
himself that things have
so far mended among academicians
as that "one may pronounce God's
holy name in the halls of the academy";
but he steadily refused to be
nominated for a <em>fauteuil</em>.</p>

<p>Reboul's relations with the great
men of his day were active and cordial.
No party feeling separated
him from any on whom the stamp
of genius was set equally with himself.
He corresponded with distinguished
personages of all countries,
English, French, Italian, etc., admired
and appreciated the literature of
foreign lands, followed the intellectual
movement of Europe in every
branch of learning, and supplied by
copious reading of the best translations
his want of classical knowledge.
The Holy Scriptures and the
patristic literature of the church were
familiar and favorite studies with
him; in every sense of the word, he
was a polished and appreciative
scholar. The accident of his birth
and circumstances of his life in no
way interfered with this scholarship,
and it would be a great mistake to
suppose that he was but a phenomenon,
a freak of nature, a working-man
turned suddenly poet, but having
beyond the gift of ready versification
no further knowledge of his
art or grasp of its possibilities. In
1834, having addressed to Lamennais
a poetical warning and remonstrance,
he says that, receiving no
answer, "he is appalled by the silence
of this man. Heaven forefend that
the pillar which once was the firmest
support of the sanctuary should be
turned into a battering-ram!..."
The Christian world knows that
this prophecy came true, but there
are those who believe that on his
death-bed the erring son was drawn
back to the bosom of his mother.</p>

<p>In 1844, Reboul was chosen as
spokesman by the deputation of
Nîmes to the reception awarded M.
Berryer by the town of Avignon.
He says: "The illustrious orator
said so many flattering things to me
that I was quite confounded. He
called me his <em>friend</em>.... Then, addressing
us all, his words seemed so
fraught with magic that the immense
audience hung breathless on his lips,
but when he began to speak of
France his voice, trembling with love
of our country, took our very souls
by storm, and you should have seen
those southern faces all bathed in
tears of admiration. We had need
of a respite before applauding&mdash;but
what an explosion it was!" At another
time he writes: "Where has Berryer
lived that he should be able to
escape the influence of the hazy
phraseology of our age and keep intact
that eloquence of his, at once so
clear and so trenchant?"</p>

<p>Manzoni's genius seemed to make
the two poets, though not personally
acquainted, companions in spirit.
M. de Fresne, who knew the Milanese
<i lang="fr">littérateur</i>, was charged with
Reboul's homage to him in verse, and
Reboul himself speaks thus of the
impression made on a friend of his
by Manzoni's <cite>Inni Sacri</cite>:</p>

<p>"We read and admired everything
in the book. The hymn for the
5th of May particularly struck Gazay;
he was quite beside himself, as
I knew he would be. This nature,
rugged and trenchant (<i lang="fr">osseuse et
brève</i>), which is so impatient of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
milk-and-water<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> style of literature,
found here a subject of enthusiasm;
he rose from his chair, walked up
and down the room with gigantic
strides, and barely escaped breaking
through the floor."</p>

<p>His judgment of Victor Hugo is
both interesting and striking. In
1862, when <cite>Les Misérables</cite> was published,
he comments thus on the
great herald and apologist of revolution:</p>

<p>"It is always the same glorification
of the convict-prison and the
house of prostitution, a theme which
has for many years been dragged
over our literature and our drama.
I do not like Hugo's <em>bishop</em> any
more than Béranger's <i lang="fr">curé</i>; the former
is a fool and the latter a drunkard.
The author of <cite>Les Misérables</cite> is vigorous
in his style, no doubt, but he
carries the defects of this quality to
the last pitch of absurdity. The
style is vigorous and rugged, true&mdash;but
<i lang="fr">c'est du 'casse-poitrine' et du 'sacré
chien,' de l'eau-de-vie de pommes-de-terre</i>.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
I do not know what to expect
from the next two volumes, but
up to this it all seems to me to
breathe the air of a low public-house
(<i lang="fr">buvette de faubourg</i>). The ostentatious
praise of the socialist organs
confirms this opinion. The multitude,
as well as kings, has its flatterers.
I think that honest poverty,
lacking everything, and yet shutting
its eyes and ears to temptation, would
have been a type worthier of the author's
reputation, if it were only for a
change!"</p>

<p>A year later, in 1863, we see Reboul
reading with interest a criticism
of Lamartine on this same work,
and recording his satisfaction at the
implied condemnation. "But," says
our poet, "it is only, alas! the blind
leading the blind. One is astonished
to see the devastation created
in these two great intellects by the
forsaking of principle."</p>

<p>His relations with Lamartine were
close and affectionate, but his admiration
for the poet yet left him a
severe measure for the man. In 1864,
he wrote him an address in verse
on dogma, or rather, as he calls it,
divine reason, as the foundation of
all legislation, and from his reasons
drew consequences not over-favorable
to the "historian-poet." "But,"
he says, "I tried to be respectful
without ceasing to be frank." Lamartine
answered him a few months
later, and promised him a visit. Reboul
then says of him: "I found
him as amiable, as much a friend as
ever; there must be something great
in the depths of that man's heart.
May Providence realize one day my
secret hopes for his soul's welfare."
When seven years before Lamartine
came to see him at Nîmes, Reboul
was his <em>cicerone</em> to the ruins and
sights of the Roman colony, and the
exquisitely graceful compliment of
the world-known poet to his brother
artist was thus worded: "This is
worth more than all I saw during
my Eastern journey." Of Lamartine's
poetical genius, and Victor
Hugo's claims to the renown of posterity,
Reboul has no doubt, for he
says that the former's <cite>Lac</cite> and the
latter's lyrics "will never die."</p>

<p>The reader may like to know the
opinion of Lamartine himself on Reboul.
We find it in his <cite>Harmonies
Poétiques</cite>, where he dedicates a piece
to him entitled "Genius in obscurity,"
and appends the following anecdote,
which will remind us of Châteaubriand's
earlier visit. This was the
first time the two poets met, and,
like most of Reboul's friendships, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
was sought by the greater man&mdash;or
rather, should we not say the higher-placed
rather than <em>greater</em>?</p>

<p>"Every one knows the poetical
genius, so antique in form, so noble
in feeling, of M. Reboul, poet and
workman. Work does not degrade.
His life is less known; I was ignorant
of it myself. One day, passing
through Nîmes, I wished, before going
to the Roman ruins, to see my
brother-poet. A poor man whom I
met in the street led me to a little,
blackened house, on the threshold
of which I was saluted by that delicious
perfume of hot bread just from
the oven. I went in; a young man
in his shirt sleeves, his black hair
slightly powdered with flour, stood
behind the counter, selling bread to a
few poor women. I gave my name;
he neither blushed nor changed
countenance, but quietly slipped on
his waistcoat, and led me up-stairs
by a wooden staircase to his working
room, above the shop. There was
a bed, and a writing-table, with a
few books and some loose sheets
of paper covered with verses. We
spoke of our common occupation.
He read me some admirable verses,
and a few scenes of ancient tragedy,
breathing the true masculine severity
of the Roman spirit. One felt that
this man had spent his life among
the living mementos of ancient
Rome, and that his soul was, as it
were, a stone taken from those monuments,
at whose feet his genius had
grown like the wild laurel at the foot
of the Roman bridge over the Gard.</p>

<p>"I saw Reboul again in the Constituent
Assembly. His was a free
soul, born for a republic; a heart
simple and pure, and whose like the
people needs sorely to make it keep
and honor the liberty it has won, but
will lose again unless it be tempered
by justice and hallowed by virtue."</p>

<p>It will be seen that Reboul himself
did not agree with Lamartine's
estimate of him, nor indeed with many
of the great poet's religious and political
views; but the tribute to our hero
is only rendered more honorable by
this dissidence of opinion.</p>

<p>Many other names might be added
to the list of Reboul's literary acquaintances.
Montalembert, at whose
request he paraphrased in verse the
famous article published in the <cite>Correspondant</cite>,
"Une Nation en deuil,"
a plea for Poland written by the author
of <cite>The Monks of the West</cite>; Père
Lacordaire, Mgr. Dupanloup, M.
de Falloux, Mme. Récamier, Mme.
de Beaumont, a graceful poetess,
Canonge, his fellow-poet of Nîmes,
Charles Lenormand, and hosts of others.
Artists too he held in great honor:
Sigalon, a painter full of promise,
of a poor family in Nîmes, and whom
Reboul characterizes as one who, had
he lived, would have been a modern
Michael Angelo; Orsel, of whom he
speaks in these enthusiastic terms:
"I showed my friends some of Orsel's
sketches, which they found more <em>true</em>
and more <em>holy</em> than Raphael's style.
I will not go so far, for the judgment
of ages and of so many connoisseurs
unanimously proclaiming the supremacy
of the great Italian is a stronger
authority in my eyes than the exclamation
of a few men in a given
moment of enthusiasm. Still I was
astounded. Some vague remorse
seized me when I reflected that I
had regarded this man with indifference,
not yet knowing his works!
But when I think that I actually read
so many of my bad verses to one
who had before his mind's eye such
holy and beautiful types, and that
he was good enough to listen patiently,
it is not admiration, but veneration
that I feel towards him."</p>

<p>Reber, the musician, who in 1853
was deservedly elected member of
the <cite>Institut de France</cite>, and Rose, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
young sculptor, whose Christian genius
was worthy of being placed in
contrast (in his admirable <em>bassi-relievi</em>
of the Stations of the Cross in the
church of S. Paul, at Nîmes) with the
perfection of Hippolyte Flandrin's
magnificent frescos, were also among
Reboul's artistic friends. In a comparison
instituted by our poet between
popular and high art, we find
the following pungent comment:
"M. Courbet has painted women
fitted, by the rotundity of their dimensions,
to be exhibited at a fair,
and his name is incessantly in the
papers. On the other hand, M.
Ingres is seldom if ever mentioned!"</p>

<p>Reboul's voluminous letters to M.
de Fresne trace unconsciously a most
noble moral portrait of the writer.
Here are a few characteristic touches,
putting in relief his manliness and
freedom from petty vanities or weak
susceptibilities. There was not the
shadow of a meanness in Reboul's
mind; his soul was simplicity itself,
and was rather like those dark, deep
waters of some of the American lakes,
at whose bottom every pebble is distinctly
visible.</p>

<p>"One of the advantages of the position
in which it has pleased God to
place me," he says, "is that I hear
the truth told me point-blank and
without any circumlocution whatever,
and, thank God, I am inured to
this. I have found out since that
what once galled my pride has had
other and important results, so that
both friend and foe have served me....
I bow to nothing save that
which is <em>beautiful everywhere and at
all times</em>, and progress to my mind
signifies only the fashioning of my
works more and more according to
this eternal standard. If I do not
succeed, therefore, be sure that it is
through human helplessness and not
intentional profanation."</p>

<p>He thus distinctly recognizes his
art as a mission, a sacred thing to be
reverently handled, and not <em>profaned</em>
by compromises with the local and
accidental spirit of the age. And
again: "If the poet condescends to
these intrigues behind the scenes, he
loses what should be his greatest
treasure: the consciousness of his
own dignity.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Theatrical plaudits,
success, all that is outside ourselves:
the poet should seek to live at peace
with his own soul, for alas! man
cannot fly from himself, and woe to
him if he has need to blush for his
deeds before the tribunal of his own
conscience.... There is too much
water in the wine of success to
inebriate me.... Time, which is
God's mode of action, deprives us little
by little of everything which can
be salutary guardianship, until that
supreme moment when it leaves us
face to face with itself alone. Let
us strive to prepare ourselves for
this awful <em>tête-à-tête</em>." Reboul possessed
the true pride of a noble heart
which consisted in doing simply
every duty required of him alike by
his poor condition and his admirable
talent. Of the former he never
showed himself ashamed and repeatedly
refused to change it; yet this
refusal was perfectly honest. If he
was in no ways ashamed of his lowly
origin, at the same time he was
equally far from making it a boast.
On the publication of his <cite>Traditionelles</cite>
(a volume of detached poems)
M. Lenormand devoted to it a laudatory
and appreciative article in the
<cite>Correspondant</cite>. Reboul noticed this
in the following words: "I have only
one observation to make, however:
I would rather they had left the
'baker' out of the question, certainly
not because the allusion humiliates
me, but because I fear that it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>points towards making an exception
of my verses, as a moral <i lang="la">lusus naturæ</i>,
and it is my ardent wish, on the contrary,
to be judged quite outside such
circumstances. I can say this the
more frankly, because I have never,
in my <cite>Traditionelles</cite>, disguised my
origin, and indeed, did I not fear to
be suspected of that hateful plebeian
pride, I should even say that I would
not exchange my family for any
other. This is between ourselves."</p>

<p>And again, when the question of
his nomination to the French Academy
was under discussion, he wrote
a very similar sentence: "I can
hardly tell you why I would not
accept this candidature. This, perhaps,
will best render my idea: I am
not of the stuff of which academicians
are made. This is no outburst of
plebeian pride&mdash;the most insolent
pride of any; it is merely my true
estimate of my own position." At
another time he said, excusing himself
for not having asked a person of
high position and a friend of his to
the funeral of his mother: "Whatever
ignorance and enviousness may say
to the contrary, there are barriers between
the different classes of society
which cannot be disregarded without
unseemliness. My 'neglect' was
but the consequence of this conviction."</p>

<p>He has left carelessly here and
there embedded in the text of an
everyday letter some phrase which
seems like a proverb, so beautiful and
comprehensive is it. For instance,
speaking of the costliness of the Paris
<i lang="fr">salons</i>, he says: "The most beautiful
abodes, my dear friend, are those
where the devil finds nothing to look
upon." Of the degeneracy of modern
thought he speaks thus: "These
noble convictions are passing away,
and every thing is subjected to the
feeble equations of reason; all things
are discussed, calculated, weighed,
and the heart would appear to be a
superfluity of creation, so little are
its holy inspirations followed!"</p>

<p>And of books and their readers he
says: "We do not all read a book
alike, but each takes from it only
what his individual nature is capable
of appropriating. The prejudices of
divers schools of literature, the rivalry
of various political, philosophical, and
religious opinions, are all so many
spectacles through which we judge
the beauties or defects of any work."</p>

<p>Reboul's domestic life was a calm
and simple one; his mind craved no
pleasures beyond its silent circle, save
those which he found in books; and
his attachment to his native city and
his humble home was as touching as
it was sincere. His trade gave him
enough for a modest and assured way
of life, and he coveted no more. It
was a less precarious source of gain
than literature alone would have
been; it supported his family in comfort,
and, above all, left his own mind
at ease; and it was only towards the
end of his life that, having generously
assisted a relation in financial difficulties,
he found himself in real want.
Then only, and not till then, did he
accept, with touching sadness and
humility, the help his friends and
his heart's sovereign, the Comte de
Chambord, had repeatedly pressed
upon him in happier days. His
greatest relaxation was an hour spent
with his family or a few chosen literary
friends in his <em>mazet</em>, an enclosed
garden with a little dwelling attached,
in which were a sitting-room and a
kitchen, but no bed-rooms. We do
not know if this is a peculiar institution
of Nîmes alone or of the whole
south of France. It is constantly mentioned
by Reboul, and his letters are
often dated from it&mdash;nay, his verses
were sometimes composed there. It
was a luxury of his later days, not of
the time when he received Château<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>briand
and Lamartine in the "windmill
chamber."</p>

<p>Reboul suffered for ten years before
his death from a constitutional
melancholy, which the distraction of
several interesting journeys in Italy,
Switzerland, and Austria only temporarily
relieved; his general health
gave way by degrees, and he died on
the 29th of May, 1864. He who
had vowed his life to the glory of
God and his church was called away
from earth on the feast of Corpus
Christi, having been completely paralyzed
on the left side three days
before. He recovered neither speech
nor&mdash;to all appearance&mdash;consciousness,
and his death was as peaceful
as a child's. His native town celebrated
his funeral with all the pomp
of civic and religious honors; the
Bishop, Mgr. Plantier, made a funeral
oration over his grave, and a monument
was soon raised to his memory
by his grateful and admiring fellow-citizens.
More than that, the
city of Nîmes took charge of his
family and assured their future, as a
fitting homage to the man whose
life had been so nobly independent,
so proudly self-supporting. The Roman
colony could not bear to see
Reboul's helpless relatives the pensionaries
of a stranger, and the care
it extended to them was delicately
offered not as a boon but a right.
People of all classes, all religions, all
political opinions united in mourning
their great compatriot. We can
end with no tribute of our own more
fitting than M. de Poujoulat's warm
and eloquent words: "Noble triumph
of honest genius, of sublime
and modest virtue! many things will
have fallen, many footsteps have
been effaced, while yet Reboul will
be remembered. The only lasting
glory is that in which there is no untruth.
Reboul has left like a Christian
a world and an epoch which
often grieved his faith. He has gone
to that heaven which he had seen in
his poetic visions, and in which his
imagination had placed so many
noble types. He himself has now
become a type such as the Christian
muse would fain see placed in the immortal
fatherland of the elect."</p>

<p>The recording angel may well
have sung over his tomb these triumphant
words of the Gospel:</p>

<p>"Well done, thou good and faithful
servant; because thou hast been
faithful in a few things, I will set
thee over great things: enter thou
into the joy of thy Lord."</p>

<p>We have thus endeavored to present
a portrait of a character not often
met with in our literature. This
man of the people, and yet a royalist;
this delicately-toned poet, and
yet a man of sturdy common sense,
affords a curious and interesting
study. What has won our especial
admiration is his inflexible adherence
to principle in all that concerns
faith and the rights of the Holy
See.</p>

<h3>MORE ABOUT BRITTANY: ITS CUSTOMS, ITS PEOPLE, AND
ITS POEMS.</h3>


<p>All great national gatherings
dating from an early period have a
religious origin. The assemblies of
the Welsh, Bretons, and Gauls were
convoked by the Druids, and in the
laws of Moëlmud are designated
"the privileged synods of fraternity
and union which are presided over
by the bards." These, in losing
their pagan character under the influence
of Christianity, nevertheless
retained many of their forms and
regulations, together with the customary
place and time of meeting.
True to her prudent mode of action
among the peoples she was converting,
the church, instead of destroying
the temples, purified them, and,
instead of overthrowing the menhir
and dolmen, raised the cross above
them.</p>

<p>It was almost invariably at the
solstices that the Christian assemblies
of the Celtic nations were accustomed
to take place, as the
pagan ones had done before them,
when, in the presence of immense
multitudes, the bards held their
solemn sittings, and vied with each
other in poetry and song, while athletes
ran, wrestled, and performed
various feats of agility and strength.
In Wales, the sectaries who divided
the land amongst them have deprived
these assemblies of all religious
character and association whatsoever,
and the manners, language,
and traditions are all that remain
unchanged. In Brittany, on the
contrary, the religious element is the
dominant one, and impresses its
character not only upon the antique
observances, but also upon the rustic
literature&mdash;that is to say, the
poesy&mdash;with which the land abounds.</p>

<p>The most favorable opportunities
for hearing these popular ballads
occur at weddings and agricultural
festivities, such as the gathering-in
of the harvest and vintage, the <em>linadek</em>,
or flax-gathering&mdash;for it is believed
that the flax would become mere
tow or oakum unless it were gathered
with singing&mdash;the fairs, the
watch-nights, when, around the bed
of death, the relatives and neighbors
take their turn to watch and pray,
while those who are waiting pass
much of the time in singing or listening
to religious ballad-poems of
interminable length, or ditties like
the following, <cite>Kimiad ann Ene</cite>&mdash;"The
Departure of the Soul"&mdash;which
chiefly consists of a dialogue between
the soul and its earthly tenement:</p>

<p class="center">THE DEPARTURE OF THE SOUL.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Come listen to the song of the happy Soul's departure,
at the moment when she quits her
dwelling.</p>

<p>She looks down a little towards the earth, and
speaks to the poor body which is lying on its
bed of death.</p></div>

<p class="center">SOUL.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Alas, my body! Behold, the last hour is come;
I must quit thee and this world also.</p>

<p>"I hear the rapping of the death-watch. Thy
head swims; thy lips are cold as ice; thy visage
is all changed. Alas, poor body! I must
leave thee!"</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"If my visage is changed and horrible, it is too
true that you must leave me.</p>

your poor friend, who is, alas! so disfigured.
Likeness is the mother of love: since you
have no longer any left to me, lay me aside."</p></div>

<p>"As truly shall I return to thee as I now go
forth to the particular judgment, the thought
of which, alas! makes me tremble.</p>

<p>"Have confidence, my friend. After the northwest
wind there falls a calm on the sea.</p>

<p>God hears the Soul, and hastens to answer it
saying, Courage, poor Soul, thou shalt not be
long in pain. Because thou hast served me in
the world, thou shalt have part in my felicities.</p>

<p>And the soul, always rising, casts again a glance
below, and beholds her body lying on the funeral
bier.</p>

<p>"Farewell, my poor body, farewell! I look
back yet once more, out of my great pity for
thee."</p></div>

<p class="center">BODY.

humbly asks my lord S. Peter to let her enter

<p>"Truly thou shalt enter into the Paradise of Jesus,
who, when thou wast on earth, didst receive

turns her head, and sees her poor body like a
little mole-hill.</p>

we meet again, till we meet again in the valley

<p>"I hear sweet harmonies I never heard before.
The day breaks, and the shadows are fled away.</p>

<p>"Behold, I am like a rose-tree planted by the
waters of the river of life."</p></div>

<p>This dialogue bears a remarkable
resemblance to at least three similar
compositions by S. Ephrem Syrus,
Deacon of Edessa, who died A.D. 372.
With the Breton poem it may not be
uninteresting to compare the following
wild Northern dirge, which may
be unknown to some amongst our
readers:</p>

<p>Not in Brittany alone, but also in
most of the country parts of France,
the villagers have a custom during
the winter of assembling in each
other's cottages&mdash;or in a barn, if no
other room of convenient size should
offer&mdash;for the <i lang="fr">fileries du soir</i>, when, by
the light of a single candle, or the
blazing logs upon the hearth, round
which all sit in a circle, the women
sew or spin, while some of the company
take it in turn to sing or tell
stories, or occasionally to read aloud
for the amusement or instruction of
the rest. Besides singing ballads
which are already known, it not unfrequently
happens that the villagers
compose a new one amongst themselves
during one of these <em>veillées</em>.
Some one arrives, it may be a pilgrim,
a beggar, or a neighbor, and
relates something which has just happened;
while the hearers are talking
it over, probably another person
comes in, bringing fresh details; interest
becomes more and more excited,
and all at once there is a general
cry, "Let us make a song about it."
The poet most in renown amongst
the company is called upon to make
a beginning, to which he accedes,
after the customary amount of entreaty
has been gone through. He
improvises a strophe, which every one
repeats after him; a neighbor continues
the song, which is again repeated
by all; a third adds his share, and so
on, every new verse being taken up
by all present, and repeated with the
rest; and thus a new ballad, the composition
of all, repeated and learned
by all, flies on the following day from
parish to parish, on the wings of its
<em>refrain</em>, from <i lang="fr">veillée</i> to <i lang="fr">veillée</i>, and
speedily finds its place among the
poetry of the land. Most of the Breton
ballads are composed thus by
collaboration, and this manner of producing
them has its name in the language;
it is called <em>diskan</em> (repetition),
and the singers are <em>diskanerien</em>.</p>

<p>But it is especially at the <em>Pardons</em>,
or feasts of the patron saints, that are
to be heard in their greatest perfection
historical ballads, love-ditties,
and songs on sacred subjects; and
we turn again to the interesting pages
of M. de Villemarqué, from which we
have already drawn so largely, for a
description of these festive occasions.</p>

<p>Every great <em>Pardon</em> lasts at least
three days. On the eve, all the bells
are set ringing, and the people busy
themselves in decorating the church.
The altars are adorned with garlands
and vases of flowers, the statues of
the saints clothed in the national costume,
the patron or patroness being
distinguished by the habiliments of a
bridegroom or a bride. The former
has a large bouquet, tied with long
and bright-colored ribbons; the white
head-dress of the latter glitters with
a hundred little mirrors. As the day
declines, the church is swept and the
dust scattered to the winds, that it
may be favorable to those who are
coming to the morrow's festival. After
this, every one places in the nave
the offering he has brought the patron
saint. These offerings generally consist
of sacks of corn, bundles of flax,
soft white fleeces, cakes of wax, or
other agricultural productions, just as
in the days of Gregory of Tours, who
mentions the "multitudo
rusticorum, ... exhibens lanas, vellera, formas
ceræ, etc."<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Dancing then begins, to the sound
of the national <em>biniou</em>, the bombardo,
and tambourine, in front of the church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
or by the fountain of the patron saint,
or it may be near some ancient dolmen,
which serves as a seat for the
fiddlers: it is even stated that not
more than a century ago dancing
took place in the church itself&mdash;a profanity
which the clergy invariably set
themselves against, the bishops excommunicating
obstinate offenders.</p>

<p>In some places, bonfires are lighted
at night upon the eminence on which
the church is built, and on the neighboring
hills. As soon as the flame
leaps up the pyramid of dry leaves
and broom, the crowd walks in procession
twelve times round it, reciting
prayers or singing. The old men
surround it with a circle of stones,
and place a cauldron in the centre,
in which, in ancient times, meat was
cooked for the priests, but in the present
day it is filled with water, into
which children throw pieces of metal,
while a circle of beggars, kneeling
around it bare-headed, and leaning on
their sticks, sing in chorus the legends
of the patron saint. It was
exactly thus that the old bards sang
hymns in honor of their divinities, by
the light of the moon, and round the
magic basin encircled with stones, in
which was prepared the "repast of
the brave."</p>

<p>On the following morning, at
break of day, arrive from Léon, Tréguier,
Göelo, Cornouailles, Vannes,
and all parts of Basse Bretagne,
bands of pilgrims, singing as they
proceed on their way. As soon as
they descry from afar the church-spire,
they take off their large hats,
and kneel down, making the sign of
the cross. The sea is covered with
a thousand little barks, from whence
the wind brings the sound of hymns,
whose solemn cadence keeps time
with the stroke of the oars. Whole
cantons arrive, with the banners of
their respective parishes, and led by
their rectors. As they approach their
destination, the clergy of the <em>Pardon</em>
advance to receive them, and, at the
moment of their meeting, the crosses,
banners, and images of the saints
are bent towards each other by way
of mutual salutation, as the two processions
form themselves into one,
while the church-bells make the air
resound with their joyous clamor.
When Vespers are ended, the procession
comes forth, the pilgrims
arranging themselves according to
their different dialects. The peasants
of Léon may be recognized by their
green, brown, or black habiliments,
and bare, muscular limbs; the Trégorrois,
whose gray garb has about
it nothing particularly original, are
remarkable among the rest for their
full and melodious voices; the Cornouaillais
for the costliness and
elegance of their richly embroidered
blue or violet coats, their puffed-out
pantaloons and floating hair; while
the men of Vannes, on the contrary,
are distinguishable by the sombre color
of their apparel. The cold, calm
aspect of their countenances and
bearing would scarcely lead one to
suspect the determination of this energetic
race, of whom neither Cæsar
nor the Republican armies could
break the will, and whom Napoleon
designated as "frames of iron,
hearts of steel."</p>

<p>As the procession pours forth
from the church, nothing can be
more curious than to observe these
close ranks of peasants, in costumes
so varied and at times so strange,
with their heads uncovered, their
eyes cast down, and the rosary in
their hands; nor anything more
touching than the hands of weather-beaten
mariners in their blue shirts
and barefoot, who are come to pay
the vow that has saved them from
shipwreck and death, bearing on
their shoulders the fragments of
their shattered vessel; nothing more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
impressive than the sight of this
countless multitude, preceded by
the cross, traversing the sandy or
rock-scattered beach, while the
sound of its litanies mingles with
the murmurs of the ocean.</p>

<p>Certain parishes, before entering
the church, halt first at the cemetery.
There, among the graves of their
forefathers, the most venerable peasant
with the lord of the canton, and
the most exemplary village-maiden
with one of the young ladies of the
manor, stand on the topmost step
of the churchyard cross, and, with
their hands placed on the Holy Gospel,
solemnly renew their baptismal
vows in their own names and on
behalf of the prostrate multitude.</p>

<p>The pilgrims pass the night in tents
erected on the plain, and do not
retire to repose until a late hour, remaining
to listen to the long narrative
poems on sacred subjects which
the popular bards wander singing
from tent to tent.</p>

<p>This first day is wholly consecrated
to religion, but secular pleasures
awake with the sound of the hautboy
on the following morn.</p>

<p>The lists are opened at noon. The
tree of the prizes, laden with its
strange variety of fruits, rises in the
centre, while at its foot lows the chief
prize of all&mdash;the heifer&mdash;with its horns
gaily decked with ribbons. Numberless
competitors present themselves.
Trials of strength or skill,
wrestling, racing, and dancing, continue
without intermission until the
evening is far advanced.</p>

<p>The first two nights of the <em>Pardon</em>
are devoted to wandering singers of
every description, such as the millers,
the tailors, the ragmen, beggars, and
<i lang="de">barz</i>; but the last is exclusively the
right of the <em>kloer</em> or <i lang="no">kler</i>, of whom, as
well as of the first-named personages,
we will mention a few particulars.
The chief difference between the
miller and the other popular minstrels
is that he returns every evening to his
mill; but, like them, he makes the
round of the country, passing through
the cities, towns, and villages, entering
the farm-house and the manor,
going to fairs and markets, and hearing
news, which he puts into rhyme
as he goes on his way; and his songs,
repeated by the beggars, who are
rarely the composers of ballads
themselves, soon find their way from
one end of Brittany to the other.</p>

<p>The tailor's special characteristic
is caustic wit and raillery. "His ear
is long," says the Breton proverb,
"his eye open day and night, and
his tongue as sharp as his needle."
Nothing escapes him. He makes a
song upon everybody without distinction,
saying in verse that which,
he would not dare to say in prose,
and yet often so disguising his satire
that it is keenest where at first sight
least evident. All the value of his
songs depends upon their actuality.
He is learned in all the gossip of the
place, and if perchance on his homeward
way he lights upon a couple of
lovers, happy in the seclusion of a
wood, they find themselves next day
the subjects of his malicious muse,
and their mutual appreciation proclaimed
to all the neighborhood. Of
the miller and the ragman much the
same may be said; and yet it is but
just to add that, with all the pleasure
they find in laughing at their neighbor,
they are never guilty of calumny
against him.</p>

<p>The <i lang="de">barz</i> occupies a higher place
in the order of singers than any other,
the <em>kloer</em> only excepted. He represents
the wandering minstrels, shades
of the primitive bards, who were reproved
by Taliessin for their degeneracy
even in his day, and for living
without regular occupation or fixed
dwelling-place, serving as echoes of
popular gossip, and spending their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
days in wandering from one assembly
to another. The self-same reproaches
one hears at this present day, addressed
to the same class of people
by the Breton priests.</p>

<p>And yet some few rays of their
former glory linger around the race.
Like their ancestors, they celebrate
noble and worthy deeds, dispensing
praise or blame impartially to small
and great. Those of the ancient
bards who were blind made use of a
sort of tally-stick, of which the arrangement
of the notches served to
fix certain songs in their memory.
This species of mnemonics, which is
known in Wales as <i lang="cy">Coelbren y Beirdd</i>&mdash;the
Alphabet of the Bards&mdash;is still
in use among the <i lang="de">barz</i> of Brittany.
They also invariably observe the old
bardic law which forbade them to
enter any house without previously
asking permission by singing the
customary salutation at the door:
"God's blessing be upon you, people
of this house: God's blessing be
upon you, small and great!" and
never entering unless they receive
the answer: "God's blessing be also
upon you, wayfarer, whoever you
may be." If they do not hear this
speedily, they pass on their way.</p>

<p>Like the ancient Cambrian bards,
they are, by virtue of their profession,
a necessity at every popular festival.
They betroth the future husband and
wife, according to antique and unvarying
rites, previous to the performance
of the religious ceremony;
they enjoy great liberty of speech,
and exercise a certain amount of moral
authority over the minds of the
people; they are loved, sought for,
and honored almost as much as were
their bardic ancestors, though moving
in a less elevated sphere.</p>

<p>The name of <em>kloer</em> (<i lang="eu">kloarek</i> in the
singular) is given to the youths who
are studying with a prospect of entering
the ecclesiastical state. They
are identical with the Welsh <i lang="no">kler</i>, or
school-clerk, and in the time of Taliessin
occupied, as they still occupy,
the place of bards, forming a class by
themselves of scholar-poets.</p>

<p>The Breton <em>kloer</em> generally belong
to the peasantry or to the trades-people
of the country towns. The ancient
episcopal sees of Tréguier and
Léon, Quimper and Vannes, attract
them in the largest numbers. They
arrive there in bands from the depths
of the country, in the national costume,
with their long hair, and their
rustic simplicity and language; most
of them being from about eighteen
to twenty years old. They live together
in the faubourgs; the same
garret serves for bed-room, kitchen,
dining-room, and study. This is a
far different existence from that
which they led among the woods
and fields, and it is not long before
a complete change has come over
them. With the lessening of muscular
strength, their intellect and imagination
develop themselves. The
summer vacation takes them back to
their village homes at the season in
which, says a Breton poet, "young
hearts expand with the flowers," and
when temptations abound; thus it
not unseldom happens that the <i lang="eu">kloarek</i>
returns to his studies with the
thorn of a first love in his heart.
Then there arises a tempest in his
soul&mdash;a struggle between the love of
the creature and the Creator. Sometimes
the former is the stronger; isolation,
homesickness, leisure, contribute
to develop a sentiment of which
the germ only exists. A remembrance,
a word, a melody, or the
sound of some wild instrument which
breaks on his ear and recalls his
home, makes it suddenly burst forth.
Then he throws his class-books into
the fire, renounces the ecclesiastical
state, and returns to his native village.</p>

<p>But it is far oftener that the higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
devotion wins the day. In either
case, however, the scholar-poet must,
according to his own expression,
"comfort his heart" by making his
confidences to the muse.</p>

<p>By an instinct natural to all but
truly popular poets, the <em>kloer</em> never
write their compositions. They are
wise in this. "The memory of hearing,"
as it was called by the ancient
bards, is much more tenacious than
the "memory of letters." To write
and print their songs would be to
give up having them learnt by heart,
and repeated by generation after
generation.</p>

<p>Once become priests, the <em>kloer</em> burn
that which they have worshipped;
thus Gildas declaims against the
bards, forgetting, in his monk's habit,
that in his youth he had made one
of their number. As <em>kloer</em>, these
scholar-poets disdain the songs of the
wandering minstrels; as priests, they
equally disdain the lays of the <em>kloer</em>.
And yet, as priests, they do not cease
to sing; but that which lingered on
the earth now finds its wings and
takes a heavenward flight, and the
sacred songs and canticles which express
the warm devotion of their
hearts imprint themselves on the
memory of the people, and are, like
prayers, transmitted from age to age.
It is thus impossible to know the
date of their compositions, except by
knowing the exact period at which
their authors lived.</p>

<p>With regard to the religious events
which are the theme of the <em>legends</em>,
it is different. These compositions
belong to the domain of historical
songs and ballads, and owe their popularity
to their being the expression
of traditions already widely known
among the people.</p>

<p>We close our notice with the translation
of a little poem by a young
<i lang="eu">kloarek</i> of Léon. It is his farewell to
earthly love&mdash;a farewell which is apparently
made more easy by outward
accidentals than can always be the
case under similar circumstances. It
is entitled</p>

<h3>A VISIT TO THE GRANDE CHARTREUSE.</h3>


<p>It was a glorious September morning;
the freshness of the night was
still perceptible, although the rays
of the sun were filling the air with
a genial warmth, when, issuing from
the fortified gates of the beautifully
situated town of Grenoble, I turned
my steps towards the celebrated monastery
of the Grande Chartreuse.</p>

<p>I made an early start, as the road
before me was long, consisting of an
uninterrupted series of steep ascents,
with the exception of the first few
miles that lay along the banks of the
Isère. This level and comparatively
uninteresting country is soon passed,
and the traveller, quitting the
high-road at the village of Voreppe,
strikes into the mountains. On
reaching the brow of the hill that
rises above that village, a most beautiful
panorama presents itself to the
view. The fertile and far-famed valley
of Grêsivaudan spreads far away
to the left and right, shut in on
either side by rocky mountains, capped
by dark pine forests. The snowy
crests of the Alps are conspicuous,
while, through the centre of the valley,
the Isère, in its sinuous course,
gleams in the sun like a silver thread,
contrasting with the dark, luxuriant
green of the hemp and the gay autumnal
tints of the vine.</p>

<p>Commanding a like enchanting
view, and nestled in the hills a few
miles from Voreppe, is the Convent
of Chalais. Founded as a Benedictine
abbey in the XIth century, it
became later on a dependence of the
Grande Chartreuse. At the Revolution,
it was sold as national property,
but it was destined once again to
revert to its pious use; for in 1844
it was bought by the Père Lacordaire
for the sons of S. Dominic,
whose order he had just restored in
France. Often in after-years did he
seek there, in the presence of nature's
loveliest aspects, some slight
repose for his overworked body and
ardently active mind.</p>

<p>The road from Voreppe to St.
Laurent du Pont appeared to me
exceedingly dreary and monotonous,
more so, perhaps, than it really was,
from the contrast its bare and rugged
hills presented to the luxuriant
and richly varied scene on which I
had just been gazing. So pleasant,
however, were the anticipations that
filled my mind that the distance was
accomplished in a very short time;
and a few minutes sufficed for refreshment
at St. Laurent.</p>

<p>The village is poor; its church,
which is a new building, was built,
like most of those in the neighborhood,
by the charity of the monks
of the Chartreuse; indeed, the village
itself has been several times rebuilt
by their generosity, having frequently,
owing to the quantity of wood
used in the construction of its houses,
been burnt almost to the ground.</p>

<p>The most beautiful part of the
whole journey is now at hand. Within
a mile of St. Laurent is the entrance
to the famous gorge that bears the
name of Desert of S. Bruno. My
expectations were raised to the highest
pitch; for I had always heard
that the scenery of this gorge would
alone repay the traveller his journey
thither, even if the monastery and
its surroundings were entirely devoid
of interest. I was not, however, free
from misgivings; for how often does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
that which in itself is really beautiful
disappoint us when compared to the
bright visions that had charmed our
imagination! Such at least was the
lesson experience had taught <em>me</em>; but
to-day I was to learn something new,
for the reality far surpassed my most
sanguine expectations. Never shall
I forget the majestic grandeur of the
scenery that continued to unfold
itself to my view at every turn of the
road until I reached the monastery.
The most striking scene of the whole
journey, and the one to which the
memory loves best to revert, is without
doubt the entrance to the Desert
de S. Bruno; here both nature and
man seem to have combined to render
the features of the landscape picturesque
and sublime. The mind is
totally unprepared for what is coming.
During the first mile after leaving
the village, the road has been
pleasantly winding along the banks
of the Guiers Mort, among wooded
hills, and through rich mountain pastures&mdash;nature
in its softer rather than
in its grander aspects&mdash;and it is at a
sudden turn of the road, at a point
where the valley seems shut in on all
sides, that the entrance to the gorge
bursts upon the sight, seemingly as
if the rocks had been rent in two to
form a passage just sufficient to admit
the foaming torrent, while the road
is carried along the face of the
mountain, now rising perpendicularly
from the water's edge to an immense
height. A ruined archway,
on which is still visible the arms of
the Carthusian order, here marks the
limits of the former domain of the
monastery, and, with the bold, single-arched
bridge which carries the road
across the stream, and the rustic iron
forge that crouches under the opposite
rocks, adds a picturesque beauty
to the grandeur of the spot.</p>

<p>Until you reach the convent&mdash;that
is to say, for about eight miles&mdash;the
beauty of the scenery never for a
moment diminishes; the road, which
shows great engineering skill, follows
the course of the torrent, which
it crosses several times. At each
turn the view varies; sometimes distant
glimpses of the snowy peaks
of the Alps are obtained; at other
times you are so completely shut in
by the mountains that nothing is
visible save the magnificent forests
that cover their sides. The size of
some of the pines in these forests is
very remarkable; one could almost
imagine that they dated back as far
as S. Bruno. I could not refrain from
thinking, as I gazed on them, what
scenes they must have witnessed,
and what strange tales they could
unfold were they able to speak; of
how many could they tell who passed
along that road after bidding the
world an eternal farewell&mdash;men who
had seen life in all its gayest moods,
and, having tasted its unsatisfying
honors and delights, sought peace
and happiness in repentance and
self-denial; youths who wore still
unsullied their baptismal robes, and
fled hither to preserve that innocence
that fears even the contact
of a sinful world. They could tell
how the great S. Hugh had returned
sorrowfully along that road from the
calm home of his dear Chartreuse, to
accept, for God's greater glory, the
far distant see of Lincoln, and the
dreary task of struggling against an
unprincipled king and a corrupt
court; they could tell of many others
who, like him, had humbly trod that
path, thinking to hide themselves
from dignities and honors, but had
been recalled by the all-penetrating
wisdom of the church to wear the
mitre or the purple.</p>

<p>About midway between St. Laurent
and the monastery there rises
by the side of the road a most singular
pinnacle-shaped rock, ascend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>ing
perpendicularly to a considerable
height, and called the Pic de
L'Œillette. In connection with this
rock an amusing story is told of an
Englishman, who, having heard that
no one had ever reached its summit,
determined to secure that honor for
his country. Accordingly, he commenced
the task with a thorough
good-will, and, after much labor, succeeded
in accomplishing it to his
satisfaction. As soon as his enthusiasm,
which showed itself in the
form of three genuine British cheers,
had in some measure subsided, he
began to think of descending; to
his dismay, he discovered that to
descend would be more than difficult&mdash;indeed,
to all appearance, impossible;
and it was not until he had
passed several hours in his very uncomfortable
position, meditating, let
us hope, on the vanity of human
greatness, that he was able to let
himself down in most inglorious fashion
by the aid of ropes brought to
him by some peasants.</p>

<p>Owing to the height of the surrounding
mountains and narrowness
of the gorge, no distant views of the
monastery are obtained; and the traveller
comes very suddenly on the
imposing pile, which, from its extent,
resembles a small village. Without
being remarkable in architecture, it is
decidedly picturesque; the high pitch
of the roofs, rendered necessary by
the heavy falls of snow which occur
during seven months of the year,
and its six belfries rising to various
heights, give it a striking and quaint
appearance.</p>

<p>Before entering its solemn portals,
a few words on the origin and history
of the monastery may not be
out of place. S. Bruno, after quitting
the world, selected this spot, at the
invitation of S. Hugh, the holy
Bishop of Grenoble, as a suitable
place where, in imitation of the
fathers of the desert, he, with six
disciples, might lead a life of solitude
and prayer. At first each recluse
built himself a separate cell; but in
time, as their number increased, the
rude huts grew into a large and regular
monastery. The site of this
early settlement, now marked by the
Chapel of S. Bruno and Notre Dame
de Cassalibus, was higher than that
of the present structure, which was
chosen some thirty years after the
death of the holy founder, when the
original buildings were destroyed by
an avalanche. During its long existence,
many have been the vicissitudes
the convent has experienced;
frequently burnt almost to the
ground, pillaged by ruthless nobles
or fanatical heretics, it has always
risen again from its ruins; and in
riches or in poverty, in prosperity
or in adversity, its inhabitants have
given the same noble example of
austere virtue, unbounded charity,
and generous hospitality.</p>

<p>The Revolution of 1789 found the
Carthusian order at the height of
its prosperity; in France alone it
counted no less than seventy houses,
with immense possessions in lands
and revenues. These, of course, were
seized by revolutionary greed, and
the poor monks driven forth into
the world, even from the uninviting
solitudes of S. Bruno's desert. With
1815 came the restoration of religion
in France, and the return of the
scattered members of the religious
orders. The Grande Chartreuse once
more afforded shelter to the children
of S. Bruno, but bereft of all its lands
and forests, which had been either
expropriated by the state or sold as
national property. In July, 1816,
possession was taken in the name
of the order by Dom Moissonnier,
superior-general. A happy day it
was for the inhabitants of the surrounding
country, who had not for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>gotten
the kind and generous friends
of whom they had been deprived
for twenty-four years; and the welcome
they gave the returning fathers
proves that then, as to-day, the cry
against religious orders proceeded,
not from the people, but from that
class, more noisy than numerous,
whose sole aim is the destruction of
Christianity and the gratification of
their own evil passions.</p>

<p>The part of the building reserved
for the reception of strangers forms
one side of the spacious courtyard,
into which you enter through the
principal gateway; it contains four
large dining-halls and a great number
of bed-rooms, often, however,
insufficient for the visitors who in
the summer crowd to view this lovely
spot, and to see something of that
wondrous, and in our days unfamiliar,
institution&mdash;monastic life.</p>

<p>During one's stay at the monastery,
which, unless by special permission,
is limited to three days, one must be
content with Carthusian fare&mdash;a curious
mixture of vegetable soups, omelettes,
carp&mdash;of which there seems
to be a never-failing supply&mdash;and
wild fruits from the mountains.
Meat is never allowed within the
precincts of the convent; not even
in case of serious illness is the rule
relaxed for the monks.</p>

<p>The long walk and the invigorating
purity of the mountain air had
sharpened my appetite, and I did
ample justice to the viands placed
before me, meagre in quality certainly,
but not in quantity, finishing with
a glass of the famous <em>liqueur</em>. I
contented myself with a short stroll
after dinner, as at so high an altitude
the air is cool after sunset; indeed,
few are the evenings here, even at
midsummer, that people are not glad
to assemble for a short time around
the glowing logs before retiring to
rest.</p>

<p>At midnight, the great bell tolls
forth for matins, at which the visitor
is permitted to assist in a small
gallery looking into the church. A
solitary lamp lights but dimly the
large and naturally sombre interior.
It is an impressive sight to behold in
that solemn gloom the white-robed
monks entering one by one, and, after
prostrating themselves before the altar,
noiselessly take their places in
the choir. The office lasts until two
in the morning. The chant is low and
monotonous, unaccompanied by any
musical instrument.</p>

<p>Every morning at ten, a father
whose special duty it is to entertain
visitors shows you over the monastery,
explaining everything with the
most genial courtesy, answering with
perfect affability the oftentimes foolish
and ignorant questions that are
addressed to him. The visit lasts
about an hour and a half.</p>

<p>The chapel is spacious and lofty
but exceedingly plain, and contains
nothing to interest the antiquarian.
The largest room in the building
is the chapter-hall, which is finely
proportioned, and is decorated with
portraits of the first fifty generals of
the order, and copies of the celebrated
paintings by Lesueur representing
the life of S. Bruno.</p>

<p>By far the most interesting part of
the whole convent is the cloister, in
shape a very long parallelogram, the
two side galleries being 721 feet in
length; into them open the cells of
the monks. In the centre of the
cloister is their burial-ground; and
thus their abode in life is separated
by but a few steps from their final
resting-place. The graves of the
generals of the order are alone marked
by stone crosses; all others lie
beneath the greensward unmarked,
unnamed. The cells are now but
rarely shown. They are all alike, consisting
of two rooms one above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
other; each has a small garden.
Food is passed to the inmates through
a wicket opening into the corridor
of the cloister; for it is only on Sundays
and certain feast-days that the
monks dine in common in the refectory;
even then the strictest silence
is observed.</p>

<p>The library is not extensive; the
most valuable books and manuscripts
were given, at the Revolution, to different
public libraries. The <em>liqueur</em>
for which the Grande Chartreuse
is so renowned, and which now
forms the principal source of income
for the convent, is manufactured in
a house quite apart from the main
buildings. The process is, of course,
not shown to visitors, for the recipe
used&mdash;aromatic herbs of various
kinds&mdash;is kept a secret; and hitherto
all attempts to imitate this <em>liqueur</em>
have been failures. The manufacture
occupies a large staff of lay brothers.
The fathers take no part in it;
their lives are purely contemplative.
It takes fully two days to explore the
environs, and more time may profitably
be spent in doing so should the
tourist happen to be either an artist
or a botanist. The former will find
numberless points of view worthy to
adorn his album, while the latter will
revel in the luxuriance of the wondrous
flora which clothes the neighboring
hills. The lover of mountain-climbing
will find a pleasant and
easy day's work in the ascent of the
Grand Som, and on a fine day will be
amply repaid by the extensive prospect
the summit commands. The
less enterprising will probably be
satisfied with the many pleasant
walks through the woods and sloping
pastures that surround the monastery,
of which varied and striking views
may be obtained at every turn.</p>

<p>It was not without a feeling of sincere
regret that, on the last evening
of my stay, I ascended one of those
slopes to take a farewell view of the
venerable pile. The last rays of the
setting sun lit up the high-pitched
roofs and cross-topped belfries; a
solemn silence reigned in cloister and
courtyard, in chapel and cell. It was
a scene on which one could gaze
with unmixed pleasure, awakening as
it did in the mind feelings so calm
and peaceful&mdash;a scene so full of all
that spoke of future hopes, so empty
of all that recalled the fleeting joys
of the present!</p>

<p>But the sun had sunk behind the
horizon, and the shades of evening,
fast closing around, warned me that
it was time to cease my musings, and
seek, for the last time, the shelter of
the hospitable convent-roof.</p>

<p>Early next morning, I was back
again to the noisy world, with its
crowded streets, bustling hotels, and
busy railways; but I shall ever bear
in my memory the pleasant recollections
of that wonderful combination
of the austere charms of monastic
life with the most varied beauties of
nature, which I have endeavored to
describe in these few pages on La
Grande Chartreuse.</p>

<h3>PARIS HOSPITALS</h3>


<p class="center">FROM THE FRENCH OF M. L'ABBE O. DELARC.
</p>

<p>Hospitals convey two very different
impressions. If gone over on
the day specified for public admittance,
everything will be found in
perfect order, every article used,
every place, will shine with cleanliness;
the patients will be seen lying
under white coverlets behind the
folds of neatly drawn curtains, and
the men in attendance will be attired
in their best uniforms. Every repulsive
object has been put out of sight.
But should the visitor command sufficient
influence to obtain admission
when he is not expected, when no
preparations have been made for the
public, he will acquire a more correct
idea of human infirmity. The
atmosphere is thick and heavy, the
flickering night-lamp scarcely sheds
its pale light around. Here lies one
whose groans disturb his fellow-sufferers;
there shrieks the victim of
fever, endeavoring in his delirium to
tear away from the <em>infirmier</em> who is
holding him down; further on, half-closed
curtains insufficiently conceal
the mortal remains of such or such a
"Number," who expired a few hours
ago. Other details, too harrowing
to retrace, shall be omitted, but their
fearful reality may not be lost sight
of in a faithful account of what scenes
do occur in a hospital. A heavy
coffin is from time to time viewed at
the foot of one of the beds. It awaits
the corpse of the sufferer, with whom
his nearest survivor may have exchanged
converse on the preceding
day. These, in short, are some of
the sights witnessed without the delusive
cover of science or preparations
for a public exhibition.</p>

<p>The aversion of the poor for benevolent
institutions of this kind is
hereby explained, although incessant
efforts are being made in France to
improve the condition of hospitals in
a material point of view; and all the
objections now made are to be attributed
to mismanagement in the past
rather than to shortcomings in the
present. In spite of progress, nevertheless,
the word "hospice" and the
thing itself have retained a signification
which is replete with mournful
forebodings. On the other hand, repugnance
for hospitals is perfectly
legitimate when grounded on serious
motives, and especially when inspired
by a feeling of family love. That
man would be worthless indeed who
could abandon his relatives to public
charity without experiencing some
kind of sorrow at being unable to
keep them, through a trying illness, in
his own home. Examples of moral
desertions are nevertheless too frequent
in Paris. Physicians are well
acquainted with those sham patients
who prefer hospital bread to any
other, because they have not to earn
it. There are, however, certain adversities
here below which defy all
human foresight, which destroy old-established
positions, and render the
efforts of a whole laborious lifetime
unprofitable. A large portion of
some lives is spent in contending
with unforeseen, unsuspected vicissitudes.
Many may therefore die in a
hospital who deserved better; but, as
a general rule, this end is brought on
by a long course of dissipation, and
by oblivion of the most sacred duties.
A hospital is not unfrequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
the last <em>stage</em> on which retribution is
played out.</p>

<p>When families are averse to trust
their sick to public charity for reasons
given above, it is wise not to
argue with natural pride, founded,
after all, on a praiseworthy motive;
yet all who are anxious to relieve
the suffering members of Jesus Christ
are none the less bound to improve
the present condition of hospitals, as
far as they have it in their power so
to do.</p>

<p>The following pages are published
for the purpose of showing how
much there is to be done. Not all
the good-will nor all the experiments
tried by physicians, managers, and
almoners for the alleviation of bitter
suffering, will ever be superfluous.
Objections ever will be made to hospital
treatment that cannot be remedied;
and, do what we may, the most
active Christian charity will never
replace the tender care of a mother,
daughter, or sister.</p>

<p>After a careful examination of the
question, the first lesson acquired is
that home relief is the best solution
to the problem of misery and illness
in needy families; it encourages the
lower classes, besides, to perform
their domestic duties.</p>

<p>In one case out of ten, it is highly
prejudicial to remove a patient from
his surroundings; moreover, it loosens
the family tie, and in Paris especially,
where these bonds are so slight
and so incessantly undermined by
false theories, it is a more damaging
course than elsewhere.</p>

<p>Statistics are very justly resorted to
for the solution of many of our problems,
but their conclusions cannot be
blindly adopted in medical cases;
physicians themselves often warn us
against glancing them over without
investigation. Figures do, however,
undeniably prove that mortality in
hospitals is much larger than in private
dwellings. A considerable number
of patients, to whom fresh air is
a boon, cannot breathe a vitiated atmosphere
with impunity. Crowding
is particularly prejudicial to the
wounded and in lying-in hospitals.
"In 1861," says Dr. Brochin, in his
<cite>Encyclopædia of Medical Sciences</cite>, "the
proportion of patients cured by home
relief was 49 to 100, while the proportion
of deaths in private dwellings
was 9 to 100. During this
same period, deaths in the hospitals
were 13 to 100. The average space
of time required for the treatment of
each patient in his own home is from
14 to 39 days; in the hospitals, from
25 to 83. The average cost of a patient
per day is 1 fr. 19 c.; the
entire treatment of each, 16 frs. 90 c.;
whereas, in the hospitals, a patient
costs 2 frs. 25 c. per day, and 61 frs.
45 c. for an entire cure. These figures
plead in favor of home relief."</p>

<p>A great deal has been said in these
latter times of those immense edifices
pompously called "Model Hospitals."
There is Lariboisière, for
instance, and the new Hôtel Dieu.
It would have been wiser had the
government spent less in one instance,
and been more lavish in another; for,
while these magnificent buildings
were being erected, palaces were also
in course of construction all over the
capital, and the laboring classes, thus
driven from their workshops, were
compelled to seek lodgings up in
attics or in out-of-the-way localities.
If some trouble had been taken to
cleanse and widen the poor man's
tenement, or had something been
done towards putting him in the way
of getting food at little cost, we should
boast fewer façades, fewer sumptuous
edifices, but the work would be
more meritorious.</p>

<p>Physicians have energetically opposed
the idea of accumulating so
large a number of patients in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
Hôtel Dieu as it was originally intended
it should contain. Let us
trust the observations of experienced
men will be taken into consideration,
and that the number of beds will be
diminished before final arrangements
are completed.</p>


<h4>HOSPITAL BEDS.</h4>

<p>Our beds are too close; and
another thing which strikes a foreigner
on visiting our hospitals is that
the divisions which are supposed to
seclude one patient from his neighbor,
are perfectly useless for that purpose.
In many cases, they are done
away with altogether. The proximity
of beds varies, however, according
to the different asylums.
Some of the buildings were not
intended for hospitals, and their managers
have had to turn rooms into
wards in the best way they could, in
spite of defective architecture. It is
difficult to specify the exact distance
kept between the beds; but an idea
can be conveyed when I state that
any patient, by stretching his arm
out, without any great exertion could
easily touch his neighbor's hand.</p>

<p>In many hospitals, the beds have
been coupled by two and two, so
that, if two patients are thus closer to
each other on one side, the distance
is larger from other patients on the
opposite side.</p>

<p>There is, however, always space
enough left for a night-table between
every two beds. In most hospitals,
beds are hung round with white calico
curtains; but in some asylums
they are omitted, and in these there
is literally nothing to hide patients
from view. Such a system of total
exposure is perfectly inhuman. I
should say it originates in a spirit of
<em>medical socialism</em>; for it compels sufferers
to exhibit their wounds to each
other during the doctor's visit. Some
men and all women cannot endure
this ordeal without a struggle. Why
not sympathize with that which can
be alleviated, if not entirely cured?
What would be our feelings if, when
brought low by fever and diet, we
had to lie near a man who is breathing
his last, and to remain in full
view of his corpse for long hours after
he had expired? But, as before
said, the larger number of hospital
beds are hung round with curtains,
maintained in opposition to our Paris
doctors, who have repeatedly protested
against them, insisting that all
hangings draw unwholesome miasms,
and are therefore receptacles of contagion.
This objection is not unfounded;
eminent practitioners experience
great uneasiness on the subject,
and the curtain difficulty has
often been debated by managers of
sanitary institutions.</p>

<p>Endeavors have been made to obviate
the evil by a renewal of hangings
every six months; in spite of
the great expense, the difficulty exists.
It is next to impossible to ventilate
a ward encumbered to excess
with beds and hangings; and, if the
principals of hospitals do still advocate
curtains, it is because they are
actuated by motives of a <em>moral</em> order.
In M. Husson's <cite>Study of Hospitals</cite>
we find: "These calico divisions are
a great comfort to female patients; it
is a great relief to them to be able to
conceal their diseases from the public
gaze, and thus to isolate themselves
from surrounding wretchedness.
This feeling of modesty, or
shyness in other cases, will long resist
the most eloquent exhortations
of our doctors on general salubrity."</p>

<p>Our present hospital regulations
do not carry out the purpose for
which curtains are intended. It is
usual to draw them all back at eight
<span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, and they are left open until the
doctor's visit is over and the wards
have been swept. This lasts till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
about mid-day. The consequence of
this arrangement is that, during the
most delicate operations, such as the
dressing of wounds, the doctor's examination,
and the change of a patient's
linen, there is no sort of privacy
around the sufferer, no more consideration
shown for women and young
girls than for others. In the day-time,
another regulation prevails. Inspectors
forbid concealment behind
the curtains on account of the difficulty
they would experience on surveying
proceedings in the wards.
For these reasons, the curtains are
elegantly looped aside, and contribute
more to the decoration of the
beds than to use.</p>

<p>Every ward contains two rows of
beds, placed along the lateral walls
in such wise that the patient's head
is near the wall, and his feet turn towards
the centre of the ward. Why
could not a low partition, covered
over with stucco, be raised between
each bed? This separation need
not exceed 1 metre 50 centimetres
in height, nor 1 metre 50 centimetres
in width. It would part the
beds, and not obstruct ventilation in
the upper regions or down the central
passage. If the ward were lighted
by a sufficient number of windows
to allow of one being opened in each
of these "cells," the circulation of so
much fresh air would greatly benefit
the sick.</p>

<p>The front of each cell being open,
surveyors would find their task rendered
easy, neither would their inspection
be hindered by a small iron
rod being affixed to the outer side
of each partition, on which two light
curtains might be drawn in case of a
death, or when it were absolutely
necessary that a patient should enjoy
privacy. The slight screens would
not entail the same inconvenience as
those which are in use at present, as
they are mounted on a very complicated
plan all around the beds.
Whenever a decease occurs, the
stucco coating of the low divisions
should be washed with a sponge. It
is well known that stucco is not a
receptacle for contagion in the same
degree as drapery.</p>

<p>Such is the kind of cabinet each
patient should have to himself, and
it should be wide enough for a chair
and night-table to find place by his
bedside. These and a crucifix are
the indispensable articles every patient
has a right to. This system
would greatly simplify our hospital
beds, now consisting of so many and
such cumbersome pieces.</p>

<p>A little space might possibly be
lost; a ward now containing twenty-five
patients would only hold eighteen;
but, on the other hand, what an
improvement, and how much healthier
an arrangement in a medical point
of view!</p>

<p>Patients have certain communications
to make to their friends on the
days set aside for public admission
which are not intended for the hearing
of strangers; and, when the hour
of death is nigh, it is but natural they
should be allowed to hold converse
with their relatives without any witnesses.
Even this semi-retirement is
denied them under the present system;
whereas the plan proposed would secure
the preservation of family secrets.
It will, perhaps, be alleged that the
patient would thus be isolated from
his fellow-sufferers. By no means.
As above remarked, the cells would
be open down the central passage,
and each patient could see his
opposite neighbor. This, added to
the going to and fro of <i lang="fr">infirmiers</i>,
doctors, sisters, and regular visitors,
affords quite enough excitement for
an invalid.</p>

<p>Neither is this an innovation. It
was once tried at Munich, and, if but
imperfectly carried out, no hygienic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
objection was made to it. We find
this organization existed in one of
the oldest hospitals in France, the
Tonnerre Hôtel Dieu&mdash;a monument
described by M. Viollet Leduc in his
work, <cite>Dictionnaire Raisonné de l'Architecture
Française du XI. au XVI.
Siècle</cite>. The learned writer says this
institution can bear comparison with
the most boasted foundations of the
present day. In the archives of the
Tonnerre Hospital we find the following
document. I quote because
it forcibly reminds us of S. Vincent
de Paul: "The poor are provided
for in this institution, and the convalescent
are kept a whole week after
their cure, when they are sent away
with a coat, a shirt, and a pair of
boots. A chapel will be added having
four altars. The brothers and
sisters in charge are twenty in number;
they are bound to provide food
and drink for the wayfarer; to board
pilgrims and strangers, clothe the
poor, visit the sick, comfort the prisoner,
and bury the dead. The brothers
and sisters will not take their
meals before the sick have been attended
to...."</p>

<p>On closing this paragraph, a question
arises whether people in the dark,
middle ages were not more solicitous
for the poor than in the XVIIIth
century. A glance down a report
written for Louis XV. on the Hôtel
Dieu will corroborate this.</p>

<p>We shall doubtless hear it objected
that partitions between hospital beds
will inconvenience the doctors and
medical students; that it will be difficult
to approach patients; and young
physicians will declare they cannot
follow the <em>chef's</em> instructions near
enough. It will be said, further, that,
when any operation is going on, the
limited space allowed by a narrow
cell must exclude the use of surgical
instruments.</p>

<p>The following considerations clear
the first of these objections; but, in a
strict sense of the word, the only essential
thing is that the physician
should not be impeded in his movements
round the sufferer. He, his
assistants, and about seven or eight
more are all the spectators necessary,
and these form a sufficiently
large audience. The central passage
down all wards affords room for
more. Even as the beds are now
placed, it is not easy for a larger
number to get nearer.</p>

<p>As to operations, they are carried
on in a special hall, to which the patient
is carried; patients never are
operated on in the wards.</p>


<h4>THE DOCTOR'S VISIT.</h4>

<p>The great everyday occurrence in
a hospital is the doctor's visit. It begins
at about eight <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, and lasts till
eleven. The <i lang="fr">chef</i>, a term designating
the head-physician, examines each
sufferer in turn, inquires into his or
her state, and dictates prescriptions,
which are taken down by an outdoor
student. He is also attended by
indoor students, other outdoor students,
postulants, and auditors. The
two latter must have gone through a
course of two years' study before they
are privileged to walk the hospitals.
The postulant is not admitted before
he has gone through a special examination,
and then becomes an outdoor
student. The highest degree under
doctor is that of an indoor student;
all are, therefore, familiar with medical
science excepting the auditor, who,
though he may have studied two
years in the schools, is but a dilettante&mdash;a
kind of amateur authorized by the
<i lang="fr">chef</i> to follow him on his rounds with
the students. Many even call themselves
auditors who slip in unperceived
with the crowd. When the
head-doctor is followed by all these
young men, his <i lang="fr">cortége</i> is very numerous.
There are often as many as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
fifty in our principal hospitals, seldom
less than thirty in the minor ones.
Thus, without any amplification of a
known fact, a patient has to see
about forty strangers round his bed
every day. He is operated on in
public. Not a line of his features
contracted by pain escapes the notice
of indifferent spectators; not a motion
of his muscles is unheeded. The
professor meanwhile develops his
medical theories on the living body,
studying the "case" with care.</p>

<p>Let us for a moment imagine that
your own daughter is lying at the
hospital. She is twenty; you have
brought her up with all the care and
solicitude parents owe to their children;
you have often said in her
hearing that modesty is the loveliest
adornment; that it replaces whatever
else is wanting, and can be replaced
by nothing. For twenty years,
you have watched the growth of her
budding virtues; her Christian advancement
has been your daily care.
Her state now requires she should see
an eminent physician once every day.
Look into your heart. What is the
sensation you feel there at the idea
of her being examined by forty or
fifty medical students besides?</p>

<p>It is an indignant protest against
their attendance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is the mission of a priest to be
made the confidant of many sorrows;
he has to suffer with the sufferer, to
mourn with the mourner; and he can
state that, of all trials which attend
medical treatment in hospitals, there
is not one more distasteful than the
doctor's visit, especially to women.
I appeal to any who have heard patients
converse together; I appeal to
any brother in the ministry. Is this
not the great cause of repugnance for
hospitals?</p>

<p>On the other hand, medical science
has certain rights; doctors have to
go through an apprenticeship, practitioners
must follow a course of practice
on living beings before they are
qualified for operations; it is therefore
indispensable that the head-doctor
should be followed by disciples,
and the height of absurdity to require
he should go round the wards
alone. It is necessary, likewise, that
postulants and students should be
present; for it frequently occurs that
they are called on to dress wounds
during the doctor's absence.</p>

<p>Their attendance is consequently
unavoidable; but, this being the case,
it is all the more desirable, in the
name of female modesty, and in the
name of common respect for a needy
suffering female, that the presence of
noisy <em>auditors</em> should be done away
with. They crowd the wards, and
learn very little. It should be with
medical science as with every other:
students ought to have become familiar
with the rudiments and theories
of their profession before they
practice; and a few years in the private
schools should be gone through before
beginners walk the hospitals. The
crowd is perfectly intolerable at the
hour of the doctor's visit in our best
hospitals, especially at the <em>Cliniques</em>
and <em>Charité</em>. This might be remedied
by each medical student being
bound to keep to one asylum for an
allotted space of time, let us say
one year, after which he could be
removed to another. One of the
good effects instantly resulting from
this would be that our central city
hospitals, instead of being crowded
to the neglect of others, would find
the number of spectators greatly
thinned for the benefit of minor hospitals
now forsaken. The great thing
in all questions relating to benevolent
asylums is to examine whence
the stand-point is taken for their
consideration. Two principles present
themselves: common sense and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
humanity say that physicians and
surgeons are intended for hospitals,
not hospitals for physicians and surgeons.
Medical science&mdash;and here
we allude to the materialistic and
unsound branch of that science&mdash;replies:
"By no means. Inconvenience
must be tolerated, science and
progress go foremost."</p>

<p>Let us manfully, though sadly,
give up a share for scientific progress
(which is not an imaginary thing);
and, on looking into it, let us reflect
on the bitterness of that irony which
so often leaves us to utter the word
<em>equality</em>, coupled with that other word,
<em>fraternity</em>, which is just as little understood.
Hospitals will not answer
the end for which they were instituted
until the smallest of those
who flee hither to hide their misery
and sufferings obtain the same respect,
deference, and care lavished
on the man who owns a yearly income.</p>

<p>Some time ago, a woman afflicted
with an internal disease was carried
to a hospital. The head-doctor examined
her on the following morning,
and immediately concluded that her
case was too grave to be remedied.</p>

<p>He declared any attempt made
to operate on her would prove fatal
and hasten death; the only thing he
could do was to prescribe lenients, in
order to alleviate intense agony so
long as life held out. The young
students around him urgently insisted
on the operation being performed;
whereupon the physician,
turning towards them, and finding
expostulation unprofitable, said: "If
this patient were my wife, gentlemen,
I should not attempt what you
suggest, I should leave her in peace;
you must, therefore, not expect me
to do otherwise by this woman...."</p>

<p>Such words as these should be
engraved in letters of gold on the
hearts of all practitioners.</p>


<h4>THE POOR MAN'S DEATH.</h4>

<p>A fact that has often been set
forth by Christianity is that the secrets
of man are revealed on his
death-bed. Then it is that every syllable
he utters, every motion of his
spirit, are full of significance. The
smallest sign is a ray of light by
which a whole lifetime can be read;
and, if the amount of faith in a man
is thus disclosed, how easy it is to
compute the amount of faith in a nation
from what is supplied by observation
in so many single cases!</p>

<p><i lang="la">O mors! bonum est judicium tuum!</i>&mdash;O
death! thy judgments are equitable!</p>

<p>No man is better qualified than
the priest to look into this matter.
A large portion of his time is spent
by the dying, and my own personal
experience has confirmed me in the
following observations.</p>

<p>The most striking features as regards
faith in the dying are moral
dejection and an almost total absence
of hope. These are the inevitable
consequences of the efforts which
have for some time been made to
uproot religious principle from the
hearts of the people. It is no wonder
that hope fled with her divine
sister, faith. Can any thinker form a
notion of the state of a man who has
been down-trodden all his life, who
has been looked on as a bearer of
burdens and a <em>misérable</em>, and who
has nothing to hope for in a future
state?</p>

<p>We read in Holy Writ that, when
the waters of the deluge began to decrease,
and Noe looked out of his
ark after his arduous struggle with
the elements, he saw a dove, bearing
an olive-branch, fly towards him;
the bird was the herald of good
news, the harbinger of future deliverance.</p>

<p>Our poor, when exhausted by long
adversity, look out in vain for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
dove, and that hope which carries
peace and help seldom brightens
their last moments. Death to such
as these is nothing but acquiescence
in blind fate. What can a priest do
in such cases? Teach and enlighten.
Very true; but the patient's
physical condition does not give him
much time to do this thoroughly,
nor can the sufferer always attend to
the little the priest can do. The
thing left to be tried is the awakening
of the dying man's memory.
The priest therefore recalls the scenes
of boyhood, talks of a mother's teachings,
of the village church, the long-forgotten
first communion, etc., etc.
If the poor man come from the South
or from Alsace, the <i lang="fr">patois</i> of his native
place rouses wonderful reminiscences;
but it is useless to attempt
reasoning. A plain-spoken statement
of fact that is neither commonplace
nor trivial often creates a great
impression. It is a mistake to use
unrefined phraseology in the hope
of redeeming the illiterate by descending
to the level of their intelligence;
the lower classes prefer plain
but elevated language, and value the
price of the liquid according to the
cost of the vase in which it is contained.
Returns to God in the last
day are very scarce and always leave
much room for the mercy of the Almighty;
but it is something to have
brought about a desire for the last
sacraments, and to have been able
to set forth, though imperfectly, one
or two of the great truths of Christianity.</p>

<p>Three dissolving elements have
greatly hastened the degenerate condition
of Paris workmen, and, in
general, of the lower classes in this
capital. They are the wine-shop, the
club, and the journal.</p>

<p>The enormous rate at which wine
was taxed under the Empire forced
the heads of small families to give
up keeping a provision of <em>ordinaire</em>
in their cellars; and, as wine could
not be kept at home, it had to be
fetched from the nearest wine-shop.
There was also an additional reason
why the usual barrel could not be
kept. Houses no longer afford the
luxury of a cellar to each flat, and
those who could have afforded to
pay the duties had no room for a cask
of wine from the provinces. But
there was the wine-shop; and alcoholic
mixtures, colored with dyeing
tinctures or logwood, were resorted
to instead of the wholesome draught
of thin but unadulterated wine which
every Frenchman, a few years ago,
was so accustomed to. When once
the habit is acquired of turning in at
a wine-shop, many are the baneful
results which ensue; first drunkenness,
then extravagance, bad associates,
low talk and discussions round
the counter, broils&mdash;all of which soon
get the better of an originally upright
conscience unsupported by firm principle.</p>

<p>The evil effects of drink were never
known to breed in France such a
cankerous wound as that which has
spread among us since the siege and
the <em>Commune</em>. Prior to these melancholy
events, alcoholic patients
were only now and then brought to
our hospitals, but they have increased
out of all proportion within the last
few years. There can be no mistaking
such cases with the following
symptoms: delirium, inflammation
of the lungs, extraordinary irritability,
then languor and that sudden debility
which is the forerunner of death. No
sooner did a <em>Communist</em> suffer amputation
than he expired; for it is
almost impossible to operate on men
who are in a continual state of intoxication.</p>

<p>Paris clubs were first heard of towards
the end of the Empire. M.
Emile Ollivier thought a good deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
of these gatherings; but they have, in
reality, proved to be a most disastrous
institution. The only good they accomplished
was to propagate a correct
idea of the <em>intellectual and moral
degeneracy</em> of our people. The lower
classes met for no other purpose than
that of uniting all their ignorance
and hates. What errors, what curses,
fell from those short-lived tribunes!
What frantic applause welcomed false
theories! No European nation could
have resisted this trial, much less than
any other the French, who are so
credulous, so fickle, so sensitive to
all outward impressions. The seeds
which bore such noxious fruit under
the <em>Commune</em> were first sown within
Paris clubs.</p>

<p>As to the public press, it would be
loss of time and space to demonstrate
how that has contributed to general demoralization.
The <cite>Siècle</cite>, the <cite>Opinion
Nationale</cite>, etc., are read at all wine-shops.
The smallest fault or misdemeanor
committed by any one connected
with the clergy is exposed by
these journals to general scandal, aggravated
by spiteful comment, exaggerated,
then thrown as a rare morsel
to open-mouthed multitudes. Such
manœuvres are very hurtful with an
unenlightened populace, who never
discriminate between religion and
those who profess it. To them the
priest and the faith are synonymous.
If the former is immoral, the latter
can be good for nothing. A certain
amount of logic is wanting by which
the contrary could be demonstrated;
but the larger proportion are incapacitated
for so intellectual an effort.
It would lead too far were I to analyze
more closely the workings of the
three causes which have destroyed
our religious and moral convictions.
Suffice it that the wine-shop, the
club, and the journal have exercised
a pernicious influence, and that our
working-classes have not the means
in their power wherewith to avert
it so long as their education is considered
complete at the age of <em>twelve</em>.
From the day a mechanic commences
an apprenticeship, he never hears the
name of God, unless it is coupled with
some curse on the lips of his elders.
The church, Jesus Christ, the sacraments,
soon become objects of derision.</p>

<p>In short, the end of such an educational
system and of such a life is
that the poor man who is carried to
a Paris hospital, there to die, knows
that he will no sooner have breathed
his last than his body will belong to
medical students; and as to his soul,
that better part which, had it been
cultured, would have been a glorious
harvest for eternity, he cannot comprehend
any discourse concerning it;
if compelled to listen because he cannot
help himself, he falls back on his
pillow in morose indifference.</p>

<p>When a nation, once so devout,
has come to this, some anxiety is felt
for its future; and the words addressed
to Ezechiel the prophet rise to
our lips: "Lord, can a new life ever
animate these scattered bones?"</p>


<h4>THE POOR MAN'S BURIAL.</h4>

<p>The deeper we dive into the subject
of Paris hospitals, the more are
we impressed by the melancholy
spectacle of extreme misery presented.
It is as if we stepped into
Dante's circles, and saw nothing before
us but horror; only here we
look stern facts in the face, and have
nothing to do with grand poetic conceptions.
It is life, it is reality, it is
anguish in a most poignant form; for
I have now to speak of the mortal
remains of Christians, of brothers, of
men like ourselves. When a death
occurs in the Paris hospitals, the
corpse of the departed remains for
one or two hours in the ward, after
which space of time it is enveloped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
in a sheet and carried out on a litter
by two <i lang="fr">infirmiers</i>.</p>

<p>None who have ever seen this
abandoned <i lang="fr">cortége</i> will forget it.
The corpse is instantly conveyed to
an amphitheatre, where it is left, after
being stripped of every thread of
linen which covered it. Here it
lies for forty-eight hours or more, according
to the arrangements made
by relatives, or to orders received
from the authorities. When no objections
are made by relatives, indoor
and outdoor students proceed to
the autopsy of the body.</p>

<p>Laws and regulations have been
laid down, by which a certain number
only of dead bodies are allowed
for medical science; but these rules
are frequently infringed, and too
much precipitation has often been
the cause of needless distress in poor
families.</p>

<p>When the necessary formalities
have been gone through, the corpses
in the amphitheatre are divided into
two series: those claimed by relatives,
and those which are left to
public charity.</p>

<p>We shall see what becomes of both,
after a few preliminary considerations.</p>

<p>The mortal remains of all Christians
are sacred in the eyes of Catholics.
We never erect a temple,
or build an altar, without consecrating
a spot therein for the relics of a
saint, which lie thus honored, like
the corner-stone of an edifice.</p>

<p>Neither does the church authorize
Mass to be said in any place not
having a consecrated place for relics;
and on such alone may the body
and blood of Christ rest during the
holy sacrifice.</p>

<p>Our belief in the resurrection of
the body; our assurance that Christians
will, on a future judgment day,
either rise in glory or stand to hear
their eternal condemnation, renders it
impossible for us to look on the mortal
remains of Christians as do materialists
and the professors of unbelief.
What to the latter is nothing but a
dead body, a fit object for study, is
to us a sacred deposit whence immortality
will germinate. It is, therefore,
no wonder if Catholics are so
solicitous to obtain proper burial for
such remains. In this instance, as
in all others, Christianity is in perfect
harmony with the tenderest aspirations
of our kindred.</p>

<p>When it so happens that relatives
of the deceased can afford to pay
down the sum of fourteen francs
(eight for a coffin, and six for the
municipal tax), a bier is provided, and
the body is buried; if the deceased
leaves behind enough money to cover
the above expenses, he is buried in
like manner, and, if any sum remains
over, it is employed according to the
will expressed by the deceased. In
some cases, survivors are willing to
incur more expense than that which
is included in an outlay of fourteen
francs; for, although this insignificant
sum is sufficient for a coffin, it does not
suffice for a shroud nor for any body-linen.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
Moreover, if the family cannot
afford to pay fifty francs over and
above the fourteen required, the body
is interred in the common grave.</p>

<p>The common grave! What a
train of sad thought this lugubrious
idea gives rise to! It is no longer,
thank God! what it was; the bodies
are not now thrown, as before, pell-mell
in a deep grave. A coffin is
provided for each, according to the
rule given above; but even in our
days, the burial of a poor man is not
what it should be.</p>

<p>Fancy a long ditch, in which the
coffins are sunk as close as possible,
and in juxtaposition; the spaces be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>tween
are filled up with children's
coffins, so as to leave no intervening
space. When the soil is covered
over this vast grave, it is not possible
for each to have a cross above, and
it is impossible, likewise, for relatives
to know the exact spot occupied
by the remains of a beloved parent.
Grave-diggers have, of late, had
orders to allow more room for the
coffins; but until a radical rule is enforced,
and until each corpse is
authorized to have a separate grave,
relatives of the departed are at the
mercy of grave-diggers.</p>

<p>However narrow and confined the
space thus left for each coffin in the
common grave, that small share is
only allowed for five years. After
that short length of time, the bodies
are exhumed, and the bones gathered
to the catacombs. The big
ditch, now vacated, again yawns for
what the diggers call "a fresh set,"
and soon the work of decomposition
again silently commences for another
term of five years, and so on for all
time.</p>

<p>Leaving every other consideration
aside, does it not strike every reader
that the period allowed for rest in the
common grave is much too short?
Many bodies are dug up in good
preservation when thus brutally disturbed,
and there are persons who
can testify to the horror they have
experienced when called on, by some
untoward circumstance, to be present
at these impious exhumations.</p>

<p>I shall not add to it by overdrawing
this sufficiently painful picture;
it does not become the pen of a priest
to color with such ghastly elements.
My object is simply to state plain
facts&mdash;to be exact, and not leave
room for the slightest contradiction.</p>

<p>Arguments have been advanced
in favor of the good influence of
this supreme misery of the common
grave. It is hoped that such an end
will be avoided, and that it will carry
a lesson with it&mdash;a horror for relying
on public charity; but it nevertheless
deals a direct blow at every
feeling of respect for kith and kin.
Is not the grief caused by eternal
partings deep enough, without being
increased by our acquiescence in the
total abandonment of the tomb?</p>

<p>Any one in authority who could
suppress the common grave, and give
every poor man separate burial&mdash;any
one who, having done this, could render
such a tomb inviolable for a reasonable
term of years, would confer
an immense blessing on Parisians.</p>

<p>When M. Haussmann gave out
the project of a large burial-ground
at Méry-sur-Oise, it met with opposition
in all quarters. It was alleged
that to send corpses out of Paris by
special railway conveyances would
be considered disrespectful to the
dead. But, we would inquire, is the
present system of interment in the
common grave calculated to inspire
respect? The distance of a few
miles, of even a few leagues, would
be nothing compared with the privilege
of a separate tombstone over a
separate grave; and it would be much
wiser to have remote cemeteries, provided
they were hospitable. This
question of the common grave not
only interests those who die within
the hospitals; it is also of importance
to the indigent wherever they die in
misery&mdash;a state many have fallen into
since the war and the <em>Commune</em>.</p>

<p>The above disclosures are certainly
very melancholy, and yet I have
only described the case of the more
fortunate among the poor&mdash;of those
who have, after all, a hallowed spot
to rest in after death. There are
some to whom even this boon is denied.</p>

<p>The interests of science and those
of families being here antagonistic, it
is necessary to quote a few figures:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 1st January, 1867, the number
of sick in the Paris hospitals was
6,243. In the course of that year,
the number was increased by 90,375;
total, 96,618. Out of this total, 79,897
left the hospitals cured; 10,045
had died. There remained, therefore,
on the 1st January of the following
year, 6,676 sick persons. In 1869,
the number of invalids in the hospitals
was 93,355, out of which 82,283
left cured; 10,429 had died on the
31st December of the same year.</p>

<p>We have, in short, an average of
10,000 deaths every year; and the
result shown by the above furthermore
is that the proportion of deaths
to invalids is about that of 1 to 8½.
I will not dwell on this latter conclusion,
which, however, proves the danger
of accumulating a large number
of cases under the same roof, and
also the necessity of a reform in our
establishments. I will pass on to
the 10,000 deaths resulting from the
report. In this average number,
there are from 1,000 to 1,500 claimed
by relatives, who purchase a right
of separate burial for <em>fifty</em> francs;
and there are from 3,500 to 4,000
who are conveyed to the common
grave. The remaining 5,000, not
claimed by any relative or friend,
are dissected, either at the Ecole de
Médecine or at the Rue Fer-à-Moulin.
These corpses are used after
dissection for the manufacture of skeletons,
for anatomical institutions, for
museums, etc., etc. The <em>detritus</em> collected
when these purposes have been
accomplished are carried promiscuously
in biers to the Hospital Cemetery,
which is situated near the Fort
of Bicètre, not far from Turg.</p>

<p>No spectacle can be more distressing
than that of this cemetery, to
which access is gained by a side
door in the wooden palings that fence
it round. It is a dreary plain, and
has no sign to show it is consecrated
to the departed. The ridges look
more like trenches than graves. No
living being has been led here by
love to mark the mounds with a
cross, neither is this sign of redemption
erected over the door, as it is in
the smallest hamlet; no holy-water
is sprinkled over these graves. Why
should no difference be made here
between a churchyard and a public
field? I again repeat that these 5,000
corpses are those of the deceased not
claimed by relatives; and this it is
which constitutes a striking inequality
between the indigent who die in
their own homes, and those who die
in the care of public charity. When
a poor man dies on his own bed, and
has not left any provision for his
burial, the <i lang="fr">mairie</i> of his <em>arrondissement</em>
has to provide a coffin gratis,
and the municipal tax is suppressed;
whereas no such generosity as a
coffin is granted in the hospitals. A
man dying here without the fourteen
francs mentioned is carried to one or
other of the amphitheatres. There is
no favor shown, even were the departed
your own mother. Fourteen
francs for a ransom, or the heart of
the parent that beat for you is the
prey of medical students. A priest
is sent for when the corpses have
been dissected. It is then his duty
to stand up, facing the mutilated remains,
and to read the prayers for
the dead. When this ceremony is
over, they are conveyed to the hospital
cemetery. Need I insist that
the religious rite performed as I have
described is of little consolation to
those who are left behind? It is not
a separate service for each of the
deceased; several bodies lie together,
or rather, the members of their bodies&mdash;a
galling sight, which surviving
relatives avoid. Neither can it be defended;
for, until the religious ceremony
has been performed, the remains
are not collected in a coffin;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
they lie unshrouded, a hideous exposure
of human flesh.</p>

<p>I here repeat that I am not opposed
to medical science, nor to the
dissection of certain corpses; it is an
unavoidable process for the benefit
of progress in surgery, and for that
of the living; what I have in view is
the welfare of the state as acquired
by respect for ties of kindred, and
by veneration for the mortal remains
of Christians.</p>

<p>There is a middle course to be
adopted very evidently&mdash;a course by
which surgery and science generally
would be promoted and the religious
convictions of Christians not trampled
under foot. I propose that,
when any person claims the body of
a parent or relative in the first degree,
that person should be privileged to
obtain gratuitous burial, if he or she
prove utter incapacity to meet the
expenses. This proof is acquired by
a certificate from the almshouses,
by receipts from the <i lang="fr">Mont de Piété</i>
(Loan Bank), by a line from the <i lang="fr">mairie</i>,
and other sources. A relative in the
first degree implies a father, mother,
wife, husband, son or daughter, brother
or sister. Even were grandfathers
and grandmothers included, the
5,000 corpses left to hospital charity
would not be greatly diminished;
4,000 bodies would remain at least
for dissection&mdash;those of wandering
strangers, of lawless, unknown persons
mostly&mdash;and surely this is a high
figure for the indigent population of
one capital. There are no better surgeons
in Europe than those of Göttingen,
Wurzburg, Salerno, Montpellier,
Vienna, and Berlin, and yet
these cities have not near so many
dead bodies in their amphitheatres.</p>

<p>I say that a Christian must feel
deeply for those who are left without
proper burial, a sign on their tombs,
a stone to perpetuate their memory
for a few years. All this is replaced
by the jests of indifferent students;
and, instead of the friendly parting
kiss, there is the surgeon's instrument
on a loved brow.</p>

<p>O old reminiscences of the early
catacombs! how far off, how faint, are
you now. Who is there in this
large city that remembers what a
work of mercy it is to bury the dead?
O village churchyards! in the centre
of which rises the humble church-spires;
O graves! over which the fervent
kneel every Sunday&mdash;graves that
never open to give up their dead;
O hallowed spots! around which
thoughts of God are united with
thoughts of our dear ones, and where
the past is folded, as it were, hand
in hand with the future, how do I
prefer you to these grand cemeteries,
in which there is so much
show for one or two, and nothing
for the poor man who will want no
more!</p>

<h3>A WEEK AT THE LAKE OF COMO.</h3>


<p>For perfect quiet and certain inspiration,
the poet or artist could
hardly choose a more suitable summer
roost than any one of the villages
that fringe the Lake of Como;
while for health the advantages of
this neighborhood are unrivalled. It
combines the beauty of softened lines
and veiled colors that distinguishes
Italy with that more bracing atmosphere
peculiar to Alpine countries.
The lake is there for luxurious midnight
expeditions under the Italian
sky&mdash;romantic glidings in boats
which, if neither so graceful nor so
mysterious as the gondolas of Venice,
are yet picturesque enough in
their&mdash;only apparent&mdash;cumbersomeness;
the mountains are there for
English pedestrian exercise, for long,
delightful, tiring walks over crag and
scanty vineyard, and, beyond that,
through chestnut woods and cypress
clearings, till the limit of bareness
begins to warn you of Alpine snows;
excellent little hotels are there, hardly
spoiled by the many but quickly
fleeting guests whom the shabby
little black steamboat brings in cargoes
three times a day&mdash;hotels with
clean, dapper bed-rooms and bay windows
overlooking the lake&mdash;hotels
where you can always get plenty of
fresh milk and graceful Italian civility.
Then there are villas by the
score, some to be hired, and many
more utterly forlorn and deserted;
others well cared for, pleasantly tenanted
by happy, unpretending Italian
families, and wearing a general
air of attractive, half-civilized rusticity.
You feel that life must go
on very smoothly within their walls;
that bright, artless women and children
chatter and laugh away their
brief summer holiday in those spacious
verandas and vine-trellised piazzas;
and that conventional restraint
is an unknown spirit there. You wish
that you had a right to enter such
an abode, or money enough to create
one for yourself just for three
months at a time; then may be you
pass by another kind of dwelling,
with broad, grass-grown steps meeting
the water like those of the palaces
of Venice; with a great rusty
iron gate and railing showing tarnished
remains of heraldic gilding;
with a garden now overgrown with
weeds, but whose tall hedges of box
or ilex suggest the statuesque style
of the XVIIth century; with melancholy
fountains innocent of water,
and Etruscan-shaped stone vases
once filled with flowers, and now
holding only a little stagnant rainwater;
with another flight of gaunt
steps leading up to a porch and innumerable
stone balconies and terraces
notched with half-ruined carvings
of the Renaissance; moss and mould
everywhere, life nowhere; funereal cypresses
mounting guard over mutilated
statues of fauns and wood-nymphs;
rats and mice peopling in
reality the marbled-paved halls of
the mansion; and ghosts&mdash;in your
imagination&mdash;pacing up and down
the broad, deserted corridors. Then,
if you are of a poetic turn of mind,
you forget the brightness, the freedom,
the <em>laisser-aller</em> of the peopled
villas, and wish that you were lord
of this vast, melancholy, romantic
pile, the natural scene of some stately
poem, the fitting frame of some
picture like Millais' pathetic "Hu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>guenot
Lover," the sure source of
an inspiration lofty, noble, vague,
and richly proportioned. Everything
is on a scale of magnificence,
such as suggests only extravagance
to our dwarfed notions of the proprieties
of life; a modern visitor
feels a pigmy in those vast, re-echoing
halls; he almost expects some
Brobdingnag halberdier in cloth of
gold and scarlet to catch him up by
the hair as some insect curiosity, or at
least to order him out as an impertinent
intruder; the great marble
staircase seems to be alive with the
shades of the noble throngs who,
in Spanish doublets, jewelled <em>toques</em>,
needle-like swords, and stiff neck-ruffs,
used to parade the courtly
scene&mdash;in fact, he finds himself utterly
overwhelmed by the phantoms of a
greatness that is dead; swamped by
the flood of modern days that has
brought in a generation of monkeys
to consume their lives in efforts to
fill the place of a generation of lions.</p>

<p>Again, the traveller may find other
sights among the villas of the Lake
of Como&mdash;less pleasant sights, too,
and jarring on the artist's sense of
fitness; as, for instance, when he finds
a wealthy and prosaic <em>paterfamilias</em>,
of the class who do not know and
care less what antiquity means&mdash;unless
it may mean shabbiness&mdash;established
in placid and ludicrous
possession of some stately abode such
as we have named. Of course, this
unappreciative being, with his robust
wife and chubby olive-branches, is
of the great, dominant, self-sufficient
Anglo-Saxon race, with its grand
physical contempt of everything that
is foreign, but its keen national determination
to take timely advantage
of everything that is cheap. He
may be from our own or the other
of the Atlantic shores; from the
cotton-mills of England or the oil-wells
of America; but he will invariably
be a man of prosaic and practical
tendencies, quite impervious to the
romance of his new home, but perfectly
alive to its value as a good speculation
and an economical venture.
You will never find an artist or a
scholar thus established; <em>they</em> will be
penned up in a white-washed room
of some peasant's cottage, or, if lucky
members of their craft, in the "best
room" of the <em>Signor Curato's</em> little
presbytery. They, too, are on the
lookout for cheap lodgings; but
what is cheap to the careful millionaire
is the height of impossible extravagance
to the gifted brain-worker.
And for our part, if we had to share
the home of either of these two
classes of lake tourists, we should
much prefer a shake-down at the
white-washed cottage, with the human
counterweight of the artist, than the
surroundings of marble halls, spacious,
deserted gardens, and ghost-haunted
staircases, if balanced by the incongruous
presence of the prosperous
family before mentioned. What
poetic justice is it which sternly forbids
the tenantship of such abodes to
be interchanged?</p>

<p>Just such a beautiful place&mdash;but,
luckily, not thus tenanted&mdash;is a villa
on the Lake of Como, just opposite
the sharp end of the tongue
of land which, jutting into the lake
to the distance of half its length,
cuts it into the shape of a Y. We
passed it every day on our way to
the chapel. It was formerly, if we
remember rightly, the pleasure-house
of Queen Caroline of England during
her exile. No one ever goes there
now, and its aspect is as suggestive,
as gloomy, as pathetic, as Edgar Poe
or Mrs. Radcliffe could have wished.
Just beyond it, on the narrow slip of
land which runs parallel to the lake
at the foot of the abrupt mountains,
is a private chapel, built over the
family vault of the Marquises of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
A&mdash;&mdash; and Counts of S&mdash;&mdash;, an old
Savoyard family of great piety and
high origin. The land around here
is part of their patrimonial estate,
and the chapel contains two or three
very beautiful monuments of white
marble, exquisite in carving and finish,
but hardly very Christian in
taste.</p>

<p>Further up, and to be reached by
a pleasant, rugged path right behind
our little hotel, was another church&mdash;a
village parish church this time, a
much more homely and <em>homelike</em> place&mdash;served
by a gentle old <em>curato</em>. The
view over the lake from the jasmine-covered
parapet surrounding this
church was lovely&mdash;so peaceful that
it suggested rather the possible surroundings
of a holy soul just released
from the body than the actual home
of a busy, struggling, mortal life.</p>

<p>To heighten the illusion, the moon
rose slowly as we descended the
same path, and her broad silver
shield, as it passed seemingly behind
the crags of the mountains on the
opposite shore, became momentarily
stamped with the irregular outline of
dark rocks, simulating to our imagination
the turrets and spires of a
spectre city. Soon the path of light
traced by her rays upon the waters
began to shine like the Israelites'
guiding pillar in the wilderness, and
we felt tempted to try a water-excursion
as a fitting ending to our day.
The beauty of the scene, as the shadows
grew darker and the moonlight
more intense, is indescribable. Our
silent party in the boat did not even
attempt to admire it <em>out loud</em>. The
hills, purple-black in the foreground,
rising out of the lake as walls of onyx
from a crystal floor, grew stone-gray
as they receded from sight and mingled
their colors with the unearthly
white of the Alpine snow-peaks in the
far distance. These last seemed as
though hung like a bridal wreath
between earth and heaven, resting on
the dark, undistinguishable masses of
the chestnut woods covering the lower
spurs. Now and then a bell would
ring out in the still night air&mdash;a brazen
voice rolling from some village belfry&mdash;and
waking the mountain echoes till
its sound died away in a silver murmur,
mingling with the plashing of
our steady oars, and gently reminding
us that our lives had floated one hour
nearer to God. But lovely as the
scene was by night, it is difficult to
call it less lovely by day. Opposite
our temporary home was Bellaggio,
one of the most frequented of the
lake villages&mdash;a tiny hamlet of white
houses clustered together in a grove
of cypresses, and perched on a rocky
ledge overlooking the shore. The
tall, columnar trees scattered among
the houses almost suggested the idea
of a peaceful burying-ground, the
white cottages from a distance seeming
no bad substitutes for marble
tombstones. A gray-blue mist&mdash;the
last Italian beauty that clings to this
fairy-like outpost of Italy, invaded by
Alpine breezes and watched by craggy
sentinels&mdash;hangs over the dormant
village; the fir-trees of the neighboring
villa&mdash;the show-place of the
lake, the Villa Serbellone&mdash;waft their
scented breath over its houses, while
at its foot lie the hot-houses and
orangeries, etc., by which the owner
of this beautiful garden property tries
to emulate English taste. The Villa
Serbellone is almost a tropical marvel;
the profusion of flowers; the
scent of southern blossoms, cultivated
with assiduous care; the ivory-like
magnolia, framed in its dark and
massive foliage; the starry orange
flowers; the pineapple, in its luscious
perfection of growth&mdash;all denote the
sunny land of spontaneous productiveness;
while the velvet lawns,
emerald-colored and closely shaven;
the trim gravel-walks, rolled to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
exact point of firmness required in an
English garden; the marble vases,
overflowing with creepers of carefully
chosen and judiciously contrasted
shades; and the thousand-and-one
dainty little contrivances to make the
most of every natural advantage, display
the art of that northern land to
which its very disadvantages of climate
have taught the secret of enhancing
every beauty and almost
creating new ones by its industry.
There is little to distinguish the Lake
of Como beyond its beauty of atmosphere
and scenery&mdash;little or no historical
interest, no ruins, castles, or
towns with momentous remembrances
of troubled times in the past. The
churches are plain, and generally in
bad taste&mdash;in fact, beyond the reach
either of gorgeousness or even of
simple restoration; for the mountain
population and the fishermen of the
shore are very poor, and the inhabitants
of the lake-side villas only come
to Como for the summer. But these
poor parishioners have spiritual riches,
if not temporal comforts: the faith
of the Italian, and the <em>naïve</em> enthusiasm
of mountaineers. One day,
after landing for a moment during
one of our boat excursions, we fell
into conversation with an old woman,
her brown, wrinkled face lighted up
by eyes of the intensest black, sparking
with a vigor strangely in harmony
rather than in contrast with her
age, and her dress, in its picturesque,
but we fear uncomfortable dilapidation,
quite a study for a painter. She
was very devout, and, when she found
that we were <em>forestièri</em>, anxiously
asked if we were Christians. This
reminds us of what happened in the
North of Ireland to a Catholic
English lady of distinction. Her
husband was a Protestant, and she
accordingly started alone one day to
find the church, which she knew to
be somewhere in the neighborhood
of the place at which she was temporarily
staying. It was not a Sunday.
She lost her way, and, meeting an old
woman, asked her to set her on the
right road for the Catholic "Chapel."
The old dame looked very suspiciously
at the elegant costume of the
questioner, and well knowing, by the
accent, that she was foreign to Ireland,
asked her in return, with incredulity
stamped on every expressive
feature: "Shure, she was not a Catholic?"
And, indeed, the English convert
did not succeed in persuading
the old Irishwoman that she was her
sister in the faith, until, opening her
dress, she showed her the scapular
round her neck, and put the rosary
into her hand. These marks of orthodoxy
quite convinced the staunch
old Catholic, and the English lady
reached the church at last. Having
satisfied herself, with a sort of
joyful surprise, on this cardinal
point, our Italian friend discoursed
very volubly of the Madonna, her
own priest and mountain church, and
the Pope. We had some beads with
us blessed by the Holy Father, and
offered her the choice of one of the
set. She was reverently delighted
with the opportunity, and with many
blessings and thanks, as gracefully
expressed as a poet could have
wished or done himself, she made her
selection. How her precious spiritual
nearness to the Holy Father, rendered
more palpable by the sight of the
plain brown rosary, seemed realized
in her mind's eye! She kissed the
beads again and again in a transport
of devotion, and in simple, straight-forward
language expressed her love
and loyalty to the Supreme Pontiff.
There are few women in Italy, high
or low, who have not the same feeling
for the head of the church; and
those who have it not are by no
means among the most exemplary
wives and mothers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>We were at Como&mdash;or rather, on
the shores of the lake&mdash;in March as
well as in June. The spirit of the
scene was just a little more dreamy
in the former month than even in
the latter, chiefly because there were
very few tourists, and the steamboats
went up and down the lake at longer
intervals than in the summer. The
great heat showed no signs of its advent;
the vegetation was tender and
yellow-green, yet not scant; for the
hills, whose cold breath tempers the
torrid heat of Lombardy, also protect
the lake from the biting winds
that one is used to associate with the
mention of March. It was possible
to go out boating and walking even
at noon, though the nights were
none the less beautiful and inviting;
but perhaps, at that time of the year,
the loveliest hour was early morning.
It was with such a remembrance that
we left the lake. After five o'clock
Mass, we rowed over to the projecting
tongue of mainland that cuts
the waters in two, and got into a
light open carriage of the country, <i lang="fr">en
route</i> for Milan. The air was delightfully
fresh, the sun had just
risen, and a rosy, hazy tint lay over
everything. It might have been the
Bosporus, so tranquil and softened
was the scene. Indeed, many travellers
have likened this lake to
the Bosporus, its narrow, river-like
course between the shelving mountains
being, they say, quite a reproduction
of the oriental marvel, though
it does not produce the oriental
languor characteristic of the other.
Our road for some time lay in a direction
in which we could see both
branches of the lake; then, swerving
to one side, we passed through miniature
mountain passes, green meadows
with many water-mills, and
pretty villages embowered in trees.
There was somewhat of northern
dampness in the atmosphere, but its
effect on the pasturage was certainly
satisfactory, the turf in many places
being almost worthy of the Emerald
Isle. As the hours sped on, our appetite
began to make itself felt; we
had brought nothing with us, not
even sandwiches, and the drive was
lengthening beyond our original calculations.
The wayside inns were
practically useless, the wine was
like vinegar, and bread not always
forthcoming. At length, at a place
where we changed horses for the last
time before reaching Milan, and
after we had been enjoying the
beauties of nature for ten hours on
an empty stomach, we found something
eatable, though not in a superfluous
quantity. Not long after, we
were regaling ourselves on a banquet
of fish fried in oil, and an adequate
supply of bread and butter, served
in the irreproachable Milan hotel,
once the palace of a fallen family, and
where our <em>privato</em> dining-room had
formerly been the <i lang="it">Sala di Giustézza</i>, in
which feudal lords sat dispensing
justice to their clan of retainers or

<h3>ODD STORIES.</h3>


<h4>IV.&mdash;THE INDIA-RUBBER MAN</h4>

<p>One thousand three hundred and
ninety-seven years ago, the city of
Cadiz was startled by rumors of
the presence of a mysterious person,
whose irrepressible activity was the
fear and wonder of many. Perhaps,
from a certain dusk which pervaded
his countenance, it came to be gossipped
that he was an Indian by
birth, and had arrived in Spain by
way of Africa. If, however, his color
was no fair sign of his origin, the
manuscripts found in his apartments
betrayed his affinity with the Oriental
stoics. Be this as it may, the
devices and doings of Don Ruy
Gomia de Goma had so impressed
the traditions of Cadiz that the
maker of ballads, Gil Cantor, sung
of him in language the puzzling
quaintness of which we have endeavored
to smooth out as follows into
modern English:</p>

</div>

<p>Doubtless the whimsical Gil has
here turned a venerable legend to a
subtle purpose of satire; for it appears,
from a number of traditions,
that Don Ruy distinguished himself
as a trader, courtier, gallant, and
knight-errant. He grew rich, because
no debtor ever got rid of him
till payment, and, as a cavalier, the
grace and flexibility of his carriage
and motions were the admiration of
ladies. Thus it was that, though
denounced by jealous grandees as
one sprung from the vulgar, and, in
fact, an upstart, his first appearance
at court was a triumph, and all the
more so from the great ease of his
genuflexion, and the modest liveliness
of his manner and deportment.
The fact, however, which first drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
the general attention of Cadiz to
the new cavalier was an open insult
which, it was alleged, he had cast
upon the proud escutcheon of the
fair Doña Gumesinda Vinagrilla de
Miraflores de Albujuera y Albuquerque,
Countess Delamar and Marchioness
Delcampo.</p>

<p>The story runs that the marble
heart of Doña Gumesinda had never
yielded except to the blandishments
of the bold and nimble Don Ruy.
One day, addressing her at the court
in terms of insinuating gallantry, he
stretched out his arms with so fine
a gesture of command and entreaty
that the noble maid all at once resolved
that no one should win her
love save the flexible and fascinating
philosopher; being well assured of
the softness of his heart and the tenacity
of his affections. Good right,
then, had Don Ruy to stand one
night under her leafy bower, and,
according to the fashion of the
times, sing a piteous ditty:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mi corazon es suave<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Como la goma dulce,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mis lagrimas se corren<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Con la resina triste;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oid mi cancion elastica,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oid mi cancion, señora!<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Having thus appealed to the fair
Gumesinda, he ascended at a leap
into a leafy refuge formed by the
vines and trees near her window,
and prepared to finish his song,
when he felt that one of his legs was
being pulled violently from below.</p>

<p>Nothing daunted, he allowed his
covert enemies to pull it quite to the
ground, while, still seated near his
lady's bower, he sang in strains that
moved her heart to more purpose
than his disturbers had moved his
limbs. Tired of their vain attempt
to budge him, they let go of his leg,
to their no small surprise at the suddenness
of its springing back. Immediately
he leaped down, and laid
about him; and, though twice he was
hit in vital parts by the infuriated
relatives, and, in fact, should have
been run through, he was so invulnerably
spry and spirited that he
killed a dozen or more of them
before he embraced the terrified
Gumesinda with his outstretched
arms, and carried her away, bending
somewhat under his burden. A
large force of <em>alguacils</em> barred his
path, however, and he was brought,
not without trouble, before the chief
magistrate of the city, who, being
also a relative of Doña Gumesinda,
put him immediately to the rack.
Vain, and all too vain, was the cruel
act of torture to extenuate the body
and bones, or conquer the irrepressible
being, of Don Ruy Gomia de
Goma. Gliding on tiptoe behind
his jailers, he one day escaped, and
in the night danced a fandango on
the bed and body of the Governor of
Cadiz. Who was he? the good
folk of Cadiz asked themselves time
and again. Some few visionaries
said that he was the spirit of free
inquiry, that could never be put
down or put out; and other wiseacres
averred that he was the veritable
spirit of mischief, always upturning
and turning up.</p>

<h3>NEW PUBLICATIONS.</h3>


<div class="hangindent">

<p><span class="smcap">Historical Sketches.</span> Third Series. By
John Henry Newman, D.D.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Idea of a University</span>, defined
and illustrated. By the same. London:
Basil Montagu Pickering. (New
York: Sold by The Catholic Publication
Society.)</p></div>

<p>It would perhaps be proper to say that
the revised edition of Dr. Newman's
writings bears the same relation to their
original publication that fulfilment and
prophecy sustain to each other. In the
one we see the germ, the promise, and in
the other the matured and mellowed fruit.
In the former, we foresee the inevitable
result of the principles set forth, on a
mind so single and intent on the truth.
And it is because they do not reflect the
perfect image of the truth he now holds
that he would blot some of the lines
therein written. In the latter, readers
will again meet the same wise simplicity
and transparency of style which charmed
them before, and which mark all the products
of his pen.</p>

<p>As a study of diction, Dr. Newman's
works are richly worth whatever they
cost. We doubt if any author of the time
has done more to bring both writers and
speakers down from the stilts formerly
thought essential in the expression of
thought. Almost unconsciously, the
leaven of his pure idiomatic English has
worked, until its influence is shown in
a large number of written and spoken
productions, both at home and abroad.
As a reflex of a truthful, honest soul,
deeply solicitous for the spiritual welfare
of his kind, they have a pathos and unction
which will have an ever-increasing
influence as time goes on.</p>

<p>The first of the above-mentioned volumes
embraces the matter which bore the
title, <cite>The Church of the Fathers</cite>, on its first
appearance in the <cite>British Magazine</cite>; and
the latter was published as <cite>The Scope and
Nature of University Education</cite>.</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><span class="smcap">Sacred Eloquence; or, The Theory
and Practice of Preaching.</span> By
Rev. Thomas J. Potter. Troy: P. J.
Dooley. 1873.</p></div>

<p>This work is too well known to require
any notice at our hands, having received
the warmest commendation of the hierarchy
and press on its first appearance in
England. While this edition will hardly
please those who are fastidious in the
matter of print and paper, it presents an
argument to the pockets of purchasers
which many of our seminarians will
highly appreciate. Our clerical readers
are already aware that the <cite>Sacred Eloquence</cite>
was prepared for the author's own
class in the Missionary College of All
Hallows, and resulted from the necessity
felt for a work adapted to English-speaking
students in that department.</p>

<h3>SPIRITUALISM.</h3>


<h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Spiritus sunt vagi, et insinceri, pervolantes et perscrutantes."&mdash;<em>S. Max. Taur., Tract. iv., Cont. Pag.</em></p></div>

<p>It can hardly be denied that the
question of spiritualism is forcing itself
every year more and more upon
the public attention; and that a belief
in the reality of its phenomena,
and, as almost a necessary consequence,
a suspicion of their at least
partially preternatural character, is
on the increase amongst honest and
intelligent persons. By preternatural
phenomena, I mean manifestations of
the operation of intelligences that
are not clothed in flesh and blood;
for with other than such as are so
clothed, in the way of the senses,
which is the way of nature, we have
no acquaintance.</p>

<p>I believe that few will examine seriously
and patiently the phenomena of
spiritualism as a whole without coming
upon much that they cannot, without
doing violence to their natural
instincts, attribute to anything but
preternatural agency. Whether they
reduce this to white spirits or black,
red spirits or gray, will depend for the
most part on the religious prepossessions
of the inquirers. I have said
the phenomena as a whole, because
some of these, such as cases of tables
turning, upon which the hands of the
company are resting, and, again, many
of the communications through mediums
speaking in trance or otherwise,
do not necessarily suggest preternatural
interference.</p>

<p>The phenomena on which I am
inclined to lay most stress are, 1st,
physical manifestations&mdash;the movement
or raising in the air, without
contact of any sort, of heavy bodies,
whether animate or inanimate; 2d,
intelligent manifestations involving
the communication of true information
through a human medium, which
was unknown at the time both to
the medium and recipient. Such
phenomena are not unfrequent at
successful séances, and spiritualists
have a right to demand that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
should criticise their successes rather
than their failures.</p>

<p>For examples of the phenomena
of modern spiritualism, we shall depend
mainly upon two volumes: <cite>Experiences
in Spiritualism with D. D.
Home</cite>, and the <cite>Report of the Committee
of the London Dialectical Society</cite>.
The former is a well-known though
unpublished relation of seventy-eight
séances; the relaters are gentlemen
whose names are guarantees for intelligence
and honor. Of these
séances, some were held in rooms
which Mr. Home had never before
entered, others in a variety of rooms
belonging to gentlemen taking part
in the proceedings. The supposition
of concealed machinery, possible
enough were it question of the magician's
own den, is thus effectually
precluded. The <cite>Report</cite> is a still
more remarkable volume. Even if
spiritualism were exploded absolutely,
this volume would still retain its interest
as a unique collection of mental
photographs representing every
attitude which it is possible for
the human mind to take up with
regard to spiritualistic phenomena,
from irreconcilable repulsion, through
every shade of intelligent hesitation,
to complete acceptance.</p>

<p>The <cite>Report</cite> consists of the reports
of the séances of six experimental
subcommittees, minutes of the examination
before the General Committee
of spiritualist witnesses, letters
on spiritualism from a great number
of literary and scientific persons, and
communications in the shape of experiences
and speculative essays on
spiritualism by some of its principal
adherents.</p>

<p>Subcommittee No. 1 (<cite>Rep.</cite>, p. 9)
declares itself to have "established
conclusively" "the movements of
heavy substances without contact or
material connection of any kind between
such substances and the body
of any person present." This is
confirmed by Subcommittee No. 2,
and embodied in the general report.
Amongst a great mass of well-attested
phenomena, I select the following:
"Thirteen witnesses state that they
have seen heavy bodies, in some instances
men, rise slowly in the air,
and remain there without visible or
tangible support." "Fourteen witnesses
testify to having seen hands
of figures not appertaining to any human
being, but lifelike in appearance
and mobility, which they have sometimes
touched and even grasped."
"Eight witnesses state that they have
received precise information through
rappings, writings, and in other ways,
the accuracy of which was unknown
at the time to themselves or to any
persons present, and which, on subsequent
inquiry, was found to be correct."
Many of these experimental
séances took place without the presence
of any professional mediums.
Subcommittees 1 and 2 declare that
they have never used them, and
these were particularly fertile in instances
of independent movement,
No. 1 having witnessed no less than
fifty such motions.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no room for a
suspicion of trickery, neither is it
more rational to suppose that the
phenomena had no objective existence,
but were the mere phantasms
of the excited imagination of the
company; for the witnesses testify
that they were in no such state
of excitement, and their recorded
conversation and behavior are incompatible
with any such supposition.
Again, such excitement acts spasmodically
and irregularly; but, as a
rule, the phenomena are seen by all
equally. In the few cases in which
individuals have manifested abnormal
excitement, the séances have
been frustrated. Subcommittee No.
2 sent for a neighbor to witness the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
phenomena when in full operation,
and they presented precisely the
same aspect to him as they did to
the members of the séance.</p>

<p>There remains, then, a large number
of objective phenomena of the
kind mentioned which have to be
accounted for. Three hypotheses
have been advocated with more or
less success, which I shall proceed to
consider in order.</p>

<p>1st. Unconscious cerebration expressing
itself in unconscious muscular
action. 2d. Psychic force. 3d.
Spirits. I would remark that the
first and second agree, in so far as
they make the source of the phenomena
internal; they differ in that
the first would make them the result
of a known law, the action of which
had been previously detected, whilst
the second supposes a previously unknown
law or force of which spiritualistic
phenomena are the sole evidence.</p>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p>The doctrine of unconscious cerebration
is thus expressed by Dr. Carpenter
(<cite>Rep.</cite>, p. 272): "Ideational
changes take place in the cerebrum,
of which we may be at the time
unconscious for want of receptivity
on the part of the sensorium, but of
which the results may at a subsequent
period present themselves to the
consciousness, as ideas elaborated by
an automatic process of which we
have no cognizance." Dr. Carpenter's
ground for "surmising" that
"ideational changes" may be received
unconsciously, and subsequently
recognized, and that the
consciousness or unconsciousness of
the reception depends upon their being
presented or not in the sensorium,
is the following analogy: The
cerebrum, "or rather its ganglionic
matter in which its potentiality resides,"
stands in precisely the same
anatomical relation to the sensorium
that the retina does; but visual
changes may be unconsciously received
in the retina when the sensorium
is inoperative, and may be subsequently
recognized. The reality
of this automatic reception and elaboration
of ideas is confirmed by the
phenomena of somnambulism, which
show "that long trains of thought
may, with a complete suspension of
the directing and controlling power
of the will, follow the lead either of
some dominant idea or of suggestion
from without." This doctrine, when
applied to explain the intelligent
manifestations of spiritualism, comes
to this, that you cannot argue, from
the fact that a man informs you truly
of something which he could not
possibly have learned elsewhere, and
which you know you were never
aware of in the ordinary sense of the
word, that he is informed by a superior
intelligence; for you may have
received unconsciously into your cerebrum
the information in question,
or have unconsciously elaborated it
from premises so received, and may
have communicated it to your informant
by unconscious muscular action.</p>

<p>I must do Dr. Carpenter the justice
to admit that he nowhere, so far
as I have seen, attempts to apply his
doctrine in detail to the higher phenomena
of spiritualism. He is contented
with stating it as indicating
the direction in which a solution of
such phenomenal difficulties as do
not seem to him wholly incredible is
to be looked for.</p>

<p>I have every wish to speak on
matters of physiological experiment
with the modesty befitting my comparative
unfamiliarity with the subject.
I have no difficulty in admitting
all that Dr. Carpenter says, in
his article on "Electro-biology and
Mesmerism" (<cite>Quart.</cite>, Oct., 1853), on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the action of dominant ideas, whether
original or suggested, in the production
of the phenomena of somnambulism
and mesmerism; but I hesitate
as to the possibility of receiving
in the form of an unconscious ideational
change such a piece of information
as this: "I have another sister
besides those I am used to reckon";
and of its recovery, not as an
image or sensation such as a dream
might leave, but as an unequivocal
assertion of a fact clothed in all
its native confidence. The nerve
modification, which I suppose the
"ideational change" comes to, is
here understood to play the part, not
merely of a bell whose prolonged
vibrations, when taken cognizance
of, may more or less suggest the individual
visitor, but of a photographic
negative, set aside, indeed, and
overlaid, but from which at any moment
exact representations may be
taken. This theory appears to me
to belong to the category of those
which, to borrow Dr. Carpenter's expression
(art., p. 535), "cannot be
accepted without a great amount of
evidence in their favor, but which, not
being in absolute opposition to recognized
laws, may be received upon
strong testimony, without doing violence
to our common sense." I
must add that I have met with no
such evidence either in the <cite>Quarterly
Review</cite> or elsewhere. When we ask
for instances, in which modern science
is ordinarily so fertile, it is at
least suspicious that the only at all
adequate examples produced in the
brilliant article, "Spiritualism and its
Recent Converts" (<cite>Quart.</cite>, vol. 131,
1871), are taken from the very spiritualistic
phenomena under discussion.
Let us, however, for the moment
grant all that is expressly demanded
on the score of unconscious cerebration,
and then see how far it affords
an adequate explanation of the phenomena
of spiritualism. Of course,
independent physical manifestations,
such as the subcommittees report,
fall entirely without the sphere of
this explanation; and Faraday's ingenious
machine for testing muscular
action has no place where there is
no contact of muscles. But what
are we to say to communications such
as the following (<cite>Rep.</cite>, p. 195), made
to Signor Damiani, at Clifton? He
asked of the rapping table, "Who is
there?" "Sister," was rapped out in
reply. "What sister?" "Marietta."
"Don't know you; that is not a
family name. Are you not mistaken?"
"No; I am your sister." He left the
table in disgust, but afterwards joined
in another séance at the same
house. "Who are you?" he asks.
"Marietta." "Again! Why does not
a sister whom I can remember
come?" "I will bring one." "And
the raps were heard to recede, becoming
faint and fainter, until lost in
the distance. In a few seconds, a
double knock, like the trot of a horse,
was heard approaching, striking the
ceiling, the floor, and, lastly, the table.
'Who is there?' 'Your sister
Antonietta.' That is a good
guess, thought I. 'Where did she
pass away?' 'Chieti.' 'When?'
Thirty-four loud, distinct raps succeeded.
Strange! My sister so
named had certainly died at Chieti
just thirty-four years before." "How
many brothers and sisters had you
then? Can you give me their
names?" "Five names (the real
ones), all correctly spelt in Italian,
were given. Numerous other tests
produced equally remarkable results."
He is much perplexed, naturally,
about this sister "Marietta,"
and writes to his mother about her.
He is answered that, "on such a date,
forty-four years before, a sister had
been born and had lived six hours,
during which time she had been bap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>tized
by the midwife by the name of
Mary." Now, this is not a case of
an isolated bit of information that
may have been given and forthwith
wholly disconnected from the current
of life, as an Indian child might
have been told, on the eve of its
voyage to England, that a certain
tropical berry was poisonous, which
it never saw again. In Signor Damiani's
case, the sleep of unconscious
cerebration must have been very
deep that so interesting a fact should
not have been waked up by all the
friction it must have sustained every
time of the thousand of times that
he asserted himself and his five
brothers and sisters to the exclusion
of any others.</p>

<p>But these difficulties sink into the
shade when we try to carry out the
explanation a step further. We have
to explain not merely how Signor
Damiani knew, but how the medium
knew, the astonishing fact. I can
understand how emotions of various
kinds may be read in muscular motions;
how the almost inevitable
slight hesitation at certain critical letters
may suggest them to the keen
and practised observer; but how,
amongst all the threads of thought
which cross the human mind, the
very one which must needs be the
slenderest and most remote should
get itself expressed by unconscious
muscular action, and how another
should read the hieroglyph, I simply
cannot conceive. Nothing I have
met with in the wildest spiritualism
is half so difficult to believe.</p>

<p>Here is another instance, from the
testimony of Mr. Eyre (<cite>Rep.</cite>, p. 179).
This gentleman wanted the register
of the baptism of a person born in
England, and who had died in
America a century ago. He was led
to suppose that this would be found
either in Yorkshire or Cambridgeshire.
He hunted for it for three
months, and then, in broad daylight,
without saying who he is or what he
wants, consults a medium. He says:
"Before leaving home, I wrote out
and numbered about a dozen questions.
Among them was the question,
'Where can I find the register of the
baptism I am searching for?' The
paper with the questions I had folded
and placed in a stout envelope,
and closed it. When we sat down
to the table, I asked, after some
other questions, if the spirits would
answer the questions I had written
and had in my pocket. The answer
by raps was, 'Yes.' I took the envelope
containing the questions out
of my pocket, and, without opening
it, laid it on the table. I then took
a piece of paper, and as the questions
were answered&mdash;No. 1, 2, and so
on&mdash;I wrote down the answers. When
we came to the question, where I
could get the register of the baptism,
the table telegraphed, 'Stepney
church,' and, at the same time, Mrs.
Marshall, senior, in her peculiar manner,
blurted out, 'Stepney.' Being at
that time a stranger in London, I
did not know there was such a place.
I went on with the questions I had
prepared, and got correct answers to
all of them. A few days afterwards, I
went to Stepney Church, and, after
spending some days in searching, I
there found the register of the baptism,
as I had been told."</p>

<p>Here the medium had not even
the light of the questions by which
to read the unconscious expression
of unconscious cerebration. One
cannot help wondering what may be
the muscular expression for "Stepney
church."</p>

<p>The writer in the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>,
to whom I have before referred,
shall give us the next example from
his own experience (vol. 131, p.
331). He owns that, on one occasion,
he was "strongly impressed"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
by a spiritualistic manifestation.
"He (the medium, Mr. Foster) answered,
in a variety of modes, the
questions we put to him respecting
the time and cause of the death of
several of our departed friends and
relatives, whose names we had written
down on slips of paper, which
had been folded up and crumpled
into pellets before being placed in
his hands. But he brought out
names and dates correctly, in large
red letters on his bare arms, the redness
being produced by the turgescence
of the minute vessels of the
skin, and passing away after a few
minutes like a blush. We must own
to have been strongly impressed at
the time by this performance; but,
on subsequently thinking it over, we
thought we could see that Mr. Foster's
divining power was partly derived
from his having the faculty of
interpreting the movements of the
top of pen or pencil, though the
point and what was written by it was
hid from his sight; and partly from
a very keen observation of the indications
unconsciously given by ourselves
of the answer we expected."
Indubitably in the case of two accomplices,
a preconcerted system of
movements of the top of the pencil
might be made to indicate what was
written; but, considering the enormous
variety of ways of writing, that
any one can acquire the art of
so reading chance writing is incredible.
At best this explanation only
applies to the questions. The answers,
which were given "correctly,"
in the shape of dates and causes
of death, etc., in red letters on
the medium's arm, must have been
read in the reviewer's unconscious
contortions. The force of the reviewer's
admission of the accuracy
of these communications is not affected
by the fact that when <em>another</em>
way of answering questions was
adopted&mdash;viz., the questioner pointing
successively to the letters of
the alphabet, until interrupted by
the rap&mdash;there were indications of
his manner being read by the medium.
Again, it is little to the purpose
that "the trick by which the
red letters were produced was discovered
by the inquiries of one of
our medical friends"&mdash;a most curiously
vague statement, by the bye&mdash;for
the mystery to be explained is
not the red letters, but the correctness
of the information they conveyed.
There is nothing in the
necessity of some sort of <em>rapport</em>
existing between the medium and
his questioner inconsistent with the
spirit hypothesis; there is nothing in
the subsequent experiments of the
reviewer even tending to a natural
explanation of what had so strongly
impressed him; and yet he is able to
shake off the strong impression triumphantly.
One begins to appreciate
the eloquent words of Professor
Tyndall:<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> "The logical feebleness
of science is not sufficiently borne in
mind. It keeps down the weed of
superstition not by logic, but by
slowly rendering the mental soil unfit
for its cultivation."</p>

<p>I recognize with gratitude, as one
of the many services Dr. Carpenter
has done to science, his full admission
of a series of facts in connection
with mesmerism and animal magnetism,
until the other day looked upon
with suspicion by medical men and
physiologists; and, further, I am
ready to admit that the influence of
unconscious cerebration upon some
of the phenomena of spiritualism is
probable enough. But I maintain
that it is distinctly inadequate as an
explanation. Its main use, as applied
to spiritualism, has been that of
a learned label to attract the attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
of scientific men&mdash;a scientific
rag wherewith spiritualism may cover
its nakedness, but which all the ingenuity
in the world cannot convert
into clothes.</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p>Numbers of intelligent persons,
men distinguished in science, in literature,
in the learned professions, but
whose "mental soil" has not been
rendered wholly unfit for the cultivation
of all germs foreign to the philosophy
of the day, have acknowledged
that the phenomena of spiritualism
are not only veritable, but inexplicable
by any known law. "The absolute
and even derisive incredulity
which dispenses with all examination
of the evidence for preternatural
occurrences,"<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> of which Mr. Lecky
boasts as one of the results of civilization,
has certainly lost ground of
late. Professor De Morgan says: "I
am perfectly convinced that I have
both seen and heard, in a manner
which should render unbelief impossible,
things called spiritual which
cannot be taken by a rational being
to be capable of explanation by
imposture, coincidence, or mistake.
So far I feel the ground firm under
me."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Mr. Edwin Arnold (<cite>Rep.</cite>, p.
258) speaks to the same effect: "I
regard many of the 'manifestations'
as genuine, undeniable, and inexplicable
by any known law or any collusion,
arrangement, or deception of the
senses." And so we come very
much to what S. Bonaventure said
in the XIIIth century: "Some
have said that witchcraft is a nonentity
in the world, and has no force,
save merely in the estimation of men,
who, in their want of faith, attribute
many natural mishaps to witchcrafts;
but this position is derogatory to
law, to common opinion, and, what
is of more importance, to experience,
and so has no foothold."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Law has,
indeed, long ceased to have anything
to say on the subject, and popular
sentiment, if not converted, has at
least been reduced to shamefaced
silence; but once again experience
claims her rights, and, in a great
wave extending across two hemispheres,
the experience of spiritualism
breaks upon us, and the opposite
opinion is found to lack foothold.
Even in this XIXth century, men
are beginning to admit that magic
or mysticism, call it what you will,
though overrun as ever with trickery
and delusion, is for all that no nonentity,
but a long-ignored reality,
worthy, not of derision, but of patient
examination. True many of
those who go furthest in their recognition
of the genuineness of the phenomena
do not attribute them to
spirits; still, however this may be, no
advocate of psychic force can deny
that many of the so-called marvel-mongers
of the middle ages were at
least no mere blind leaders of the
blind, but the witnesses of phenomena
none the less true because it has
been for so long the fashion to ignore
them.</p>

<p>In the middle ages, people thought
that these marvels were the work of
spirits good or bad, or at least the
result of their co-operation with man.
For such an hypothesis, modern
science has an almost invincible repugnance,
in which I think there is
much that is excusable. It is not
that the man of science necessarily
disbelieves in the existence of spirits;
but the idea of their possible interference
in phenomena which he has to
consider exercises a disturbing influence
upon all his calculations. He
is as irritated as though he should
be called upon to submit to, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
make allowance for, the tricks of
mischievous children who jerk his
arm or clog his machinery. Again,
he is haunted with the notion that,
by admitting the spirit hypothesis, he
is contributing to the inauguration
of an era of disastrous reaction. To
the eye of his imagination, the bright,
open platform, the familiar instruments,
each a concrete realization, in
honest metal, of a known law, the intelligent
modern audience, his own
classical tail-coat and white neckcloth,
melt away, and he sees himself
propitiating fickle spirits with uncouth
spells, at the bottom of a mediæval
grotto:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A shape with amice wrapped around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a wrought Spanish baldric bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a pilgrim from beyond the sea."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Not that the evil dream could ever
be realized in its integrity; but still,
when once a spiritualist reaction has
set in, who will venture to fix its
limits? And so, forgetting that the
spirit hypothesis in nowise excludes
the operation of psychic conditions,
he insists upon every indication of
such conditions, as though they were
the key to everything, and there
were no indications of any other
agency. His "mental soil," perhaps,
does not permit him to deny
the reality of the phenomena of spiritualism,
or to talk of unconscious
cerebration as a sufficient explanation;
and so he is contented to raise
his altar to an unknown god, provided
only he may baptize him into
the dynasty of science by the name
of "Psychic Force."</p>

<p>Psychic force has still to be defined.
It is the unknown cause of
certain effects, taking its color from
them only. With reference to independent
physical manifestations, it is
the power to produce "the movement
of heavy substances without contact
or material connection." In this
sense, Arago "is stated" to have reported
to the Academy of Science,
"that, under peculiar conditions,
the human organization gives forth
a physical power which, without
visible instruments, lifts heavy bodies,
attracts or repels them, according to
a law of polarity, overturns them,
and produces the phenomena of
sound."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> When considered in relation
to the whole mass of spiritualistic
phenomena, its vague, unsatisfactory
character becomes still more
apparent. The nearest approach to
a definition of psychic force, in its
larger sense, that I have met with
occurs in Mr. Atkinson's communication
(<cite>Rep.</cite>, p. 105): "It is nothing
more than the ordinary and normal
power of our complex nature acting
without impediment" (consciousness
being one of the impediments), "and
diverted from its usual relations,
though in some cases abnormal conditions
clearly favor the development."
It is hardly possible to mistake
the pantheistic character of this
passage; for this unconditioned nature,
underlying personal consciousness,
which, in virtue of its being
unconditioned, knows all and can do
all, what else can it be but a common
nature, an <i lang="it">anima mundi</i>, a
world-god? according to the pantheistic
conception of Averrhoes, "an
intelligence which, without multiplication
of itself, animates all the individuals
of the human species, in respect
to their exercising the functions
of a rational soul."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> I am
convinced that psychic force, if
drawn out as the one solution of
spiritualism, can end in nothing short
of this; but, on the other hand, I
readily admit that the "<i lang="it">anima mundi</i>"
or rather, "spirit of nature," as advocated
by Dr. H. More, Glanvil, and,
if he is not misrepresented, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>famous Carmente doctor, John Bacon,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
is not pantheistic. More, formally
rejecting the doctrine of Averrhoes
as "atheism," insists that the "spirit
of nature" is substantially distinct
from, though in intimate relations
with, individual souls. He defines
it to be "a substance incorporeal,"
how far possessing "sense and animadversion"
he may not determine,
but certainly "devoid of reason
and free-will," "pervading the whole
matter of the universe, and exercising
a plastical power therein, according
to the sundry predispositions
and occasions in the parts it works
upon, raising such phenomena in
the world, by directing the parts of
matter and their motion, as cannot
be resolved into mere mechanical
powers."<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>As capable of holding automatic
thought, processes, or their embryons,
such a spirit might lend itself as a
vehicle of direct intellectual influence
between soul and soul, as also, of
course, between souls and spirits of
another sort. But it must be remembered
that, if this might in some
measure account for the intercommunication
of thought, it in no way
tends to explain the genesis of information
of which all concerned are
ignorant. That some such brute intelligence
acts as intermediary would
seem to be borne out by the frequent
spaces of hopeless incoherency, like
nothing so much as the shaking up
of loose type, which prelude and
interrupt spiritual communications
when the intelligent will that would
fain direct matters has not yet seized
the reins, or has dropped them from
its grasp.</p>

<p>Whatever may be thought of the
theory, the following passage from
the first edition of Glanvil's <cite>Vanity
of Dogmatizing</cite> is worth quoting.
The story in it was suppressed in
subsequent editions, as too romantic
for the taste of the day:<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> "That
one man should be able to bind the
thoughts of another, and determine
them to their particular objects, will
be reckoned in the first rank of impossibles;
yet, by the power of advanced
imagination, it may very
probably be effected; and history
abounds with instances. I'll trouble
the reader but with one, and the
hands from which I had it makes me
secure of the truth on't.</p>

<p>"There was very lately a lad in the
University of Oxford, who, being of
very pregnant and ready parts, and
yet wanting the encouragement of
preferment, was by his poverty forced
to leave his studies there, and to
cast himself upon the wide world for
a livelihood. Now, his necessities
growing daily on him, and wanting
the help of friends to relieve him, he
was at last forced to join himself to a
company of vagabond gypsies, whom
occasionally he met with, and to follow
their trade for a maintenance.
Among these extravagant people, by
the insinuating subtility of his carriage,
he quickly got so much of their
love and esteem as that they discovered
to him their mystery; in the
practice of which, by the pregnancy
of his wit and parts, he soon grew so
good a proficient as to be able to
outdo his instructors. After he had
been a pretty while exercised in the
trade, there chanced to ride by a
couple of scholars who had formerly
been of his acquaintance. The scholars
had quickly spied out their old
friend among the gypsies, and their
amazement to see him among such
society had well-nigh discovered
him; but by a sign he prevented
their owning him before that crew,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
and, taking one of them aside privately,
desired him with his friend to
go to an inn not far distant thence,
promising there to come to them.
They accordingly went thither, and
he follows; after their first salutations,
his friends inquire how he
came to lead so odd a life as that
was, and to join himself with such a
cheating, beggarly company. The
scholar-gypsy, having given them an
account of the necessity which drove
him to that kind of life, told them
that the people he went with were
not such impostors as they were
taken for, but that they had a traditional
kind of learning among them,
and could do wonders by the power
of imagination, and that himself had
learnt much of their art, and improved
it further than themselves could;
and, to evince the truth of what he
told them, he said he would remove
into another room, leaving them to
discourse together, and, upon his return,
tell them the sum of what they
had talked of; which accordingly he
performed, giving them a full account
of what had passed between them
during his absence. The scholars,
being amazed at so unexpected a
discovery, earnestly desired him to
unriddle the mystery. In which he
gave them satisfaction by telling
them that what he did was by power
of the imagination, his fancy binding
theirs; and that himself had dictated
to them the discourse they held
together while he was from them;
that there were warrantable ways of
heightening the imagination to that
pitch as to bind another's; and that,
when he had compassed the whole
secret, of some parts of which he
said he was yet ignorant, he intended
to leave their company, and give
the world an account of what he had
learned.</p>

<p>"Now, that this strange power of
the imagination is no impossibility,
the wonderful signatures of the fœtus,
caused by the imagination of the
mother, is no contemptible item.
The sympathies of laughing and gaping
together are resolved into this
principle; and I see not why the
fancy of one man may not determine
the cogitation of another, rightly
qualified, as easily as his bodily motion.
This influence seems to me to
be no more unreasonable than that
of one string of a lute upon another,
when a stroke on it causeth a proportionable
motion in the sympathizing
consort, which is distant from it and
not sensibly touched. Now, if this
notion be strictly verifiable, it will
yield us a good account of how
angels inject thoughts into our
minds, and know our cogitations;
and here we may see the source of
some kinds of fascination. If we are
prejudiced against the speculation,
because we cannot conceive the
manner of so strange an operation, we
shall indeed receive no help from the
common philosophy; but yet the
hypothesis of a mundane soul, lately
revived by that incomparable Platonist
and Cartesian, Dr. H. More,
will handsomely relieve us; or, if any
would rather have a mechanical account,
I think it may probably be
made out some such way as follows:
Imagination is inward sense; to
sense is required a motion of certain
filaments of the brain, and consequently
in imagination there is the
like; they only differing in this, that
the motion of the one proceeds immediately
from external objects, but
that of the other hath its immediate
rise within us. Now, then, when any
part of the brain is strongly agitated,
that which is next, and most capable
to receive the motive impress, must
in like manner be moved. Now, we
cannot conceive anything more capable
of motion than the fluid matter
that is interspersed among all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
bodies and is contiguous to them.
So, then, the agitated parts of the
brain begetting a motion in the proxime
ether, it is propagated through
the liquid medium, as we see the
motion is which is caused by a stone
thrown into the water. Now, when
the thus moved matter meets with
anything like that from which it received
its primary impress, it will
proportionably move it, as it is in
musical strings tuned unisons; and
thus the motion being conveyed from
the brain of one man to the fancy of
another, it is there received from the
instrument of conveyance, the subtile
matter, and the same kind of
strings being moved, and much what
after the same manner as in the first
imaginant, the soul is awakened to
the same apprehensions as were they
that caused them. I pretend not to
any exactness or infallibility in this account,
foreseeing many scruples that
must be removed to make it perfect.
It is only an hint of the possibility of
mechanically solving the phenomenon,
though very likely it may require
many other circumstances completely
to make it out."</p>

<p>There are abundant records of the
marvels wrought by the imagination,
when, under the influence of desire
or fear, or even simple expectation,
the attention is concentrated upon a
particular spot or a particular set of
circumstances; but of the conditions
and nature of the operation almost
nothing is known. It would seem as
if there were a tendency in every act
of the imagination to create that
which it conceives, although it is
only in rare cases that any palpable
result ensues. Various cases of recovery
from the gravest illness, some of
which involved the arresting active,
organic mischief, are recorded as
brought about by the vehement impression
made upon the imagination
by a remedy supposed, but never
really applied. The action of imaginative
sympathy is even more
startling. Dr. Tuke relates the following
of a lady well known to him:
"One day, she was walking past a
public institution, and observed a
child, in whom she was particularly
interested, coming out through an
iron gate. She saw that he let go
the gate after opening it, and that it
seemed likely to close upon him, and
concluded that it would do so with
such force as to crush his ankle;
however, this did not happen. 'It
was impossible,' she says, 'by word
or act, to be quick enough to meet
the supposed emergency; and, in
fact, I found I could not move, for
such intense pain came on my ankle,
corresponding to the one I thought
the boy would have injured, that I
could only put my hand on it to
lessen its extreme painfulness. <em>I am
sure I did not move so as to strain or
sprain it.</em> The walk home&mdash;a distance
of about a quarter of a mile&mdash;was
very laborious, and, in taking off
my stocking, I found a circle round
the ankle, as if it had been painted
with red-currant juice, with a large
spot of the same on the outer part.
By morning, the whole foot was inflamed,
and I was a prisoner to my
bed for many weeks."<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> In another
case referred to by Dr. Tuke, "a
lady of an exceedingly sensitive and
impressible nature, on one occasion
when a gentleman visited her
house, experienced a very uncomfortable
sensation so long as he was
present, and she observed a spot
or sore on his cheek. Two days
after, a similar spot or sore appeared
on her cheek, in precisely the same
situation, and with the same characters."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>I have no fault to find with Dr.
Tuke for extending this same principle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>of sympathetic attention to the
case of stigmatization, when he says
of S. Francis, absorbed in ardent
realization of the Passion of Christ,
"So clearly defined an idea, so ardent
a faith intensifying its operation,
were sufficient to reflect it in his
body."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>I cannot help thinking that the
Fathers recognized the creative power
of the imagination when they denounced
so fiercely the masquerading
in beast-skins on the calends of January.
"Is not all this false and mad
when God-formed men transform
themselves into cattle, or wild beasts,
or monsters?"<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The numerous accounts
of the were-wolf transformation,
both in classical and mediæval
times, all point in the same direction;
and Mr. Baring-Gould brings good
authority for thinking that the etymology
of the "Barsark" rage of
the Norsemen designates it as an
outcome of their bear-skins.</p>

<p>The direct action of the imagination
upon external objects, attributed
to Avicenna (<cite>Muratori della Fantasia</cite>,
p. 268), is, of course, something further.
The Arabian philosopher is reported
to have said that, "by a strong
action of the fancy, one might kill a
camel." At the same time, the signature
on the fœtus, not merely of the
emotion of the mother's fear or desire,
but of the object or occasion of it,
would seem to imply some action <em>ab
extra</em>, as well as such cases as that
of the sympathetic bruise referred to
above.</p>

<p>That the ordinary acts of the imagination,
for all their airy and impalpable
play, do leave behind them
most momentous results, forming, as
it were, the very mould and measure
of our whole life, is a matter of constant
experience. Hence it is that
castles in the air are often so costly,
to say nothing of the danger that,
though we have built them ourselves,
we may find them haunted.</p>

<p>I am quite prepared to admit what
the Germans have called a night-side
of nature&mdash;that is, various rudimental
powers of doing many things of a seemingly
miraculous character, which
powers do very probably often co-operate
in the production of spiritualistic
phenomena, and under peculiar
organic conditions, without any spiritual
influence, may be brought into
considerably developed action. Moreover,
as it is, of course, in the investigation
of these natural bases of magic
that science will succeed so far as it
succeeds at all, it is only right that it
should expatiate in them. My complaint
is that the modern attempt to
reduce spiritualism to psychic force
involves an inadequate analysis of the
facts presented; and spiritualists have
surely some ground to complain of
the <i lang="la">prima facie</i> disingenuousness of a
manœuvre which, in regard to the
same phenomena, began with, "This
is not natural, therefore it is certainly
not true," and ends with, "This is
true, therefore it is certainly natural."</p>

<p>However much the scientific mind
of the day may dislike the preternatural
stand-point, yet it may be that,
seeing "an absolute and derisive incredulity"
is no longer regarded as
the one scientific attitude, some examination
of the views entertained
by Catholic writers on the subject
may not be without interest. Many
of the acutest amongst them for
ages have given great attention to
the phenomena of mysticism, although
mainly engaged in the consideration
of their moral and ascetical bearings.
Before leaving this second hypothesis,
I propose to bring together such
passages from the schoolmen as seem
to make the largest allowance on the
side of psychic force. Whilst there
are, I think, sufficient indications that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
the scholastics generally admit psychic
force as a natural basis and concurrent
cause in many of the phenomena
of both divine and diabolic
mysticism, it must be allowed that
passages dwelling at any length on
this point have at least the merit of
rarity.</p>

<p>Görres taught, reasonably enough,
I conceive, in his <cite>Mystik</cite>, that there
is a physical basis for the great mass
of miracles wrought by Almighty
God in and through his saints; that
is to say, that they do not, ordinarily
speaking, involve the creation of an
entirely fresh power, but are rather
the result of a divine excitation of a
power already existing in germ. Of
course, he who "of these stones can
raise up children to Abraham" only
subjects himself to the laws which he
has made in so far as it pleases him
to do so; and the scholastics were
right in their insistence upon what
they called the "obediential" power
of things&mdash;that is, their inherent capacity
of becoming anything in the
hands of their Creator. Of course,
too, it is often impossible to ascertain
in a given case whether God is using
that <i lang="la">altum dominium</i> which he possesses
as Creator, or, on the other
hand, is merely developing previously
existing powers. Everything tends
to persuade us that all nature, and
especially the human soul, is full of
rudimental powers which may be developed,
1st, by the special, immediate
action of the Creator; 2d, by
spiritual influences, good and bad;
3d, by certain abnormal conditions
of the bodily organism. I conceive
that these rudimental powers form
a common natural basis for the great
mass of both divine and diabolic
miracles, and that sometimes they
may attain to a considerable degree
of development without any special
influence, divine or diabolic. The
existence of such a common basis
would seem to be implied in the fact
that the devil has been able to imitate
successfully and really, as in the
case of Pharao's magicians, so many
of the divine miracles; for we know
that he can at most develop what
already exists, without having the
least power to create what is not.
We cannot imagine that God would
ever create where he might develop,
according to the scholastic principle
which Sir William Hamilton has
translated into the Law of Parsimony:
<i lang="la">Deus non abundat in superfluis</i>. To
take a particular example, Görres
maintains that the ascetic and mystic
process which the mind of the saint
goes through by abstraction from
earthly things, and the habit of celestial
contemplation, does really co-operate
in the phenomenon, so common in
ecstasy, of levitation. In which case,
the saint would be rather aided by
God, acting upon his body through
his soul, to rise in the air, than, properly
speaking, lifted up by him.
This levitation is common enough in
the best authenticated cases of diabolical
possession; and, if it does not
occur in cases presumably natural, at
least a wholly abnormal lightness
and agility is not unfrequent in some
of the movements of somnambulism.
We find an example of this in the
following narrative, taken from a rare
treatise of the Benedictine Abbot
Trithemius (sæc. 15), entitled <cite>Curiositas
Regia</cite> (p. 29): "Let any
one who knows nothing of nature
tell me if the specific gravity of the
body can be lightened by the action
of the mind. I, with two witnesses
to back me, will relate what I myself
experienced when a boy at school.
One night, we were four of us sleeping
in one bed; my companion rose
from beside me, as asleep as ever he
was, the moon in its fifteenth night
shining in upon us, and wandered all
over the house as though he were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
awake, with his eyes shut. He climbed
the walls more nimbly than a
squirrel. He a second and a third
time clambered up on the bed, and
trampled upon all of us with his
feet; but we felt no more of his
weight than if he had been a little
mouse. Wherever his sleeping body
came, at once all the fastenings of
the doors fell back of their own accord.
With exceeding swiftness, he
got to the top of the house, and, sparrow-fashion,
clave to the roof. I am
telling what I saw, not what I heard
in idle talk. This would seem to be
the part, not of a body, but of a
spirit which freely uses its native
power, so to speak, when the corporal
senses are bound, and it wanders
outside the mansion of the body....
We do not suppose that this
will appear wonderful to the wise,
who have a true conception of the
power and nobility of the human
mind, which in some respects is accounted
the equal of the angels, being
only separated from them by the
interposition of the body."</p>

<p>After speaking of the miracles
wrought, first by the invocation of
faith, second by sanctity, which commands
the ministration of angels,
third by the assistance of demons
through explicit or implicit compact,
he continues: "Some persons add
to these three ways a fourth, saying
that the mind or spirit of the man
himself can naturally work its miracles,
provided only it knows how to
withdraw itself from the accidental, in
upon itself, above the exercise of the
senses, into unity. Those who can
compass this undertake to work marvels,
to predict the future, to lay
open the secrets of men's hearts,
to dispel diseases, and suddenly to
change men's counsels." Trithemius
is willing to admit that some such
power exists, whilst denying that it
can attain to any perfect exercise
without some external assistance from
good or evil spirits. He gives the
same account with Görres of the
ecstatic <em>volatus</em>, viz., that the power
of God co-operates with the energy
of the saint's soul.</p>

<p>William of Auvergne, Bishop of
Paris, in the beginning of the XIIIth
century, recognizes the reality of
several of the phenomena of spiritualism,
and indicates a natural basis.
Thus, speaking of the mirrors upon
which magicians make their patients
look, he says that no images are seen
in the glass, but that what takes place
is "a bending back of the mind's
edge upon itself&mdash;of his mind, I say,
who looks upon such an instrument;
for its brightness forbids the mind's
vision exteriorating and directing itself,
and flings it back and reflects it
in such sort that it cannot but look
into itself."<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Within the mind, he
says, all sorts of wonders may be
read, for therein abides the light "to
which our souls in respect to their
noble powers are most closely united;
and one of the wisest Christians saith
that 'this light is the Creator ever
blessed,' meaning by these words
that betwixt our minds and the interior
light, which is God, there is no
intermediary, according to the prophet's
word, which, addressing the
Creator, saith, 'The light of thy countenance
is sealed upon us, O Lord';
that is, thy lightsome countenance,
which is naught else but thyself."
Whilst acknowledging that this light
is "sealed," and that its rays do but
break out like lightning flashes in a
dark night, and confessing that he has
long been cured of that error of his
youth, the notion that the purification
and abstraction necessary for such
inward vision could be profitably
achieved without the "grace of the
Creator," he yet maintains that this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>light is, up to a certain point, communicated
according to a natural law,
analogous, it would seem, to that of
the infusion of life. He considers
that a melancholy temperament favors
this abstraction, and insists that
melancholy madmen, in virtue of
their abstraction, do receive true irradiations
of this divine light, although
indefinitely fragmentary (<i lang="la">particulatas
et obtruncatas</i>), "wherefore
<em>naturally</em> they begin to discourse like
prophets of divine things, yet continue
not to talk so, save for a little
while, but lapse into words of accustomed
folly." He attributes this relapse
to their shattered condition and
the excess of the melancholy fumes
which overpower them.</p>

<p>Whatever may be thought of the
theory, few can have seen much of
mad persons without noticing the
noble fragments with which their
disjointed talk is not unfrequently
interspersed. The present writer has
often heard one of the persons concerned
relate the following story of a
madman's prophecy:</p>

<p>The narrator, with two lady friends,
had just been received from Anglicanism
into the Catholic Church in
Italy, and they were anxiously looking
forward to the new phase of life
awaiting them in England. They
were all three going over a lunatic
asylum at Palermo, when suddenly
one of the inmates strode up to them,
and with great solemnity, touching
each of them in turn, said to one of
the ladies, "<i lang="it">Il Paradiso</i>"; to the
other, "<i lang="it">La Madalena</i>"; and to the
gentleman, "<i lang="it">Molto, molto d'Argento</i>."
Of the two ladies, the first died a
holy death on the threshold of her
Catholic life, whilst the other entered
an order devoted to the reformation
of fallen women. The third part only
remains unfulfilled, and may possibly
mark the relapse into our author's
<i lang="it">desipientia consueta</i>.</p>

<p>William of Auvergne extends these
natural divine irradiations even to
the minds of animals, for which he
entertains a most unscholastic-like
respect: "Yea, this light (splendor)
is given to dogs to hunt out the most
secret thieves; ... for the dog perceives
not the thief himself, and the
sense of smell represents him not; for
a thief, as such, has no odor."</p>

<p>Trithemius and William of Auvergne
may be regarded as authors
who lay an exceptional stress upon
the natural basis of the supernatural.
The former indicates the possibility
of the alteration of the specific gravity
of the body by the action of the
soul within it; the latter suggests a
system of natural revelation akin, it
would seem, to what one meets with
in the mesmeric or somnambulistic
trance.</p>

<p>The somnambulistic and mesmeric
states would seem to be substantially
identical, although the latter
involves a relation of subjection
to the will of another which is not
necessary, though possible, at least in
some degree, to the former. Somnambulism
very frequently produces
the phenomenon of the exaltation of
the natural powers; for instance,
when in a somnambulistic state, the
singer sings more sweetly, the dancer
dances more gracefully, than in their
normal condition. The same exaltation
of natural power has been stated
sometimes to take place in deranged
persons, as Lamb indicates was the
case with himself, in his letter to Coleridge:
"Dream not, Coleridge, of
having tasted all the grandeur and
wildness of fancy till you have gone
mad. All seems to me now vapid,
comparatively so." I remember
being told by an intelligent person
very fond of singing, who was subject
to occasional fits of derangement,
that, when mad, his voice gained in
compass a good octave; even if this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
proves to be nothing but a lunatic's
delusion, it is sufficiently curious
that somnambulism should effect in
reality what madness vainly imagines.</p>

<p>From time to time, somnambulism
seems to open a door in the soul to a
source of natural revelation, such as
William of Auvergne speaks of. The
following authentic instance is particularly
noteworthy, because the
possibility of expectation, having produced,
as it often does, what was expected,
is precluded. At a school at
Thorp Arch, in Yorkshire, at the beginning
of the present century, a boy
was known to be a somnambulist.
One night, the usher saw him rise
from his bed and wander down-stairs
into the school-room. He followed,
and saw the boy go to his desk, take
out his slate, and write. On looking
over his shoulder, he read: "On such
a day of such a month next I shall
die." The boy almost directly after
went up to bed, and the usher took
the slate to the head-master. They
agreed to say nothing about it, and
another slate was substituted. The
boy went on with his routine life, apparently
quite unconscious that anything
was impending; and, indeed, it
is on all hands admitted that somnambulists
in their waking state recollect
nothing of their somnambulism.
When the day came, the boy died.</p>

<p>Sister Anne Catherine Emerich
(1774-1824), an ecstatica of Westphalia,
has expressed herself with
considerable precision on the subject
of mesmerism. Whilst earnestly
warning people against its use as to
the last degree dangerous, she admits
that the phenomena are objective,
and that the power brought into
action is <em>substantially</em> natural. What
she says is so remarkable that I
shall not hesitate to quote at some
length.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"My impression in regard to it
[mesmerism] was always one of horror,
and this sprang less from the thing itself
than from the enormous danger to which
I saw such as practised it almost always
fall a prey.</p>

<p>"The practice of magnetism borders on
that of magic; in the former, indeed, there
is no invocation of the devil, but he
comes of himself. Whoever gives himself
up to it plucks from nature something
that cannot be lawfully won except in the
church of Jesus Christ, and which cannot
keep its power of healing, and sanctifying,
except in her bosom. Nature, for all
such as are not in active union with Jesus
Christ by true faith and sanctifying grace,
is full of satanic influences. Magnetic
subjects see nothing in its essence and
in its relation of dependence upon God;
they see everything in a state of isolation
and separation, as if they were looking
through a hole or crack. They see one
ray of things; and would to God this ray
were pure&mdash;that is to say, holy! It is in
God's mercy that he has veiled and separated
us from one another; that he has
raised a wall between us. Since we are
all full of sin, and exercise influence one
upon the other, it is well that we should
be obliged to interpose some preamble
before seducing one another and reciprocating
the contagious influence of the
evil spirit. But in Jesus Christ, God
himself made man is given us as our
head, in union with whom we can, when
purified and sanctified, become one&mdash;one
body&mdash;without bringing into this union
our sins and evil inclinations. Whoever
would bring to an end in any other way
this separation which God has established
is uniting himself, after a most dangerous
fashion, to fallen nature, in which
he reigns with all his allurements who
drew it to its fall.</p>

<p>"I see that magnetism is essentially
true; but in that veiled light there
crouches a thief who has broken his
chain. All union amongst sinners is
dangerous, interpenetration more especially
so. But when this befalls a soul
that is altogether cloudless; when a state,
the condition of whose clairvoyance is its
simplicity and directness, falls a prey to
artifice and intrigue, then <em>one of the faculties
of man before his fall&mdash;a faculty
which is not quite dead</em>&mdash;is in a certain
manner revived, to leave him more unarmed,
more mystified, and exposed internally
to the assaults of the demon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
This state is real&mdash;it exists; but it is covered
with a veil, because it is a spring
poisoned for all except the saints.</p>

<p>"I feel that the state of these persons
follows a course in certain respects parallel
to mine, but moving in an opposite
direction, coming from elsewhere, and
having other consequences. The sin of a
man with only the faculty of ordinary vision
is an act wrought by the senses or in
their forum. The inward light is not
thereby darkened, but speaks in the conscience,
and urges from within, like a
judge, to sensible acts of repentance and
penance. It leads us to those remedies
which the church administers under a
sensible form&mdash;the sacraments. Then the
sensitive part is the sinner, and the inward
light the accuser.</p>

<p>"But in the magnetic state, when the
senses are dead, when the inward light
receives and yields impressions, then that
which is holiest in a man, the interior
watcher, is exposed to deadly influences,
to contagious infection of the evil spirit,
such as the soul in the state of ordinary
wakefulness can have no consciousness
of, owing to the senses, subject as these
are to the laws of time and space. At
the same time, it cannot free itself of its
sins by the purifying remedies of the
church. I see, indeed, that a soul altogether
pure and reconciled with God,
even in the state in which the whole interior
life is open, may chance not to be
wounded by the devil. But I see that if
she has previously consented to the least
temptation, as very easily happens, especially
to those of the female sex, Satan is
free to play his game in the interior of
the soul, which he always manages in a
way to dazzle her with the semblance of
sanctity. The visions become lies, and,
if she perchance discover some way of
healing the mortal body, she pays a costly
price for it in the secret defilement of
an immortal soul."</p></div>

<p>With regard to another kindred
phenomenon, viz., the projection of
the thinking soul in a visible envelope,
there is a remarkable passage
in S. Augustine (<cite>De Civ. Dei</cite>, lib.
xviii. 18). He is speaking of a story
he heard when in Italy of men being
turned into asses by enchantment,
and made to carry burdens:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"To say nothing of the soul, I do not believe
that a man's body could any how by
demons-craft be turned into bestial limbs
and lineaments; but the fantastic part of
man's nature (which, in the processes of
thinking and dreaming, is countlessly
specificated, and which, though itself no
body, yet with wondrous swiftness, when
the man's bodily senses are holden in
sleep or bondage, adapts to itself the
images of bodies) may be presented in
some I know not what ineffable way,
under a bodily form, to the senses of
others, the while their bodies be elsewhere
alive, indeed, but with their senses
much more heavily and mightily bound
than in sleep. And that fantastic part
appears to the eyes of others, as it were,
incorporated in the likeness of another
creature; and such the man seems to
himself to be, and to carry burdens.
While burdens, if they be real bodies and
not fantastic, the demons carry to deceive
spectators, who see on the one hand the
burdens, which are real; on the other the
beasts, which are mere appearances."</p></div>

<p>The phenomenon described, or rather
suggested, by the saint is substantially
identical with that of the wraith,
or apparition of the spirit of a living
person, when the soul is supposed to
be projected in a visible envelope
under the influence of some strong
emotion, the bonds uniting soul and
body being indefinitely stretched,
without being broken. Fanciful as
this sounds, the apparition of the
wraith is perhaps the best authenticated
of all ghost phenomena.</p>

<p>Plutarch (<cite>De Gen. Soc.</cite> p. 266)
would seem to indicate the same
phenomenon. The Neoplatonic interlocutor,
having distinguished the
intelligence (νοῦς) from the soul
(ψυχή), inasmuch as the former is
not properly the body at all, except
by reflection, as light in a mirror, but
floats above the man's head, bound
to the incorporated soul and yielding
light for its conduct, says, in respect
to the case of one Hermodorus,
whose soul was supposed periodically
to leave his body: "But this is not
true, for his soul did not go forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
from his body, but, slackening and
loosing the reins to the intelligence
(the δαίμων, as the wise call it, regarding
it as something external), allowed
it circumgyration and circum-frequentation
(περιδρομὴν καὶ
περιφίτησιν), and, when it had
seen or heard anything, to bear in
the tidings."</p>

<p>Catholic theologians, although
commonly denying that the soul can
be separated from the body in natural
or diabolical ecstasy, admit generally
that, in the case of the divine
<em>raptus</em>, this separation, or rather projection&mdash;for
death is supposed not to
ensue&mdash;may take place; although
many of them&mdash;amongst others Benedict
XIV. (<cite>De Beatif.</cite>, lib. iii. cap.
49)&mdash;deny that, in fact, such separation
ever does occur. On this question,
Cardinal Bona (<cite>De Discret. Spir.</cite>,
cap. 14) says: "Whether the soul,
in the higher or more vehement rapt,
sometimes leaves the body, or can
leave it, is a doubtful and difficult
question; for the apostle, caught up
into the third heaven, professed that
he knew not whether this was in the
body or out of the body; and what
so great a man did not know it is not
for us to define. 'For who,' saith
Augustine, most learnedly disputing
of the rapt of Paul, 'would dare to
say he knew what the apostle said he
did not know?' The same ignorance
possessed S. Teresa's mind;
for, describing the effects of rapture
in <cite>The Castle of the Soul</cite>, mans. 6
c. 5, she says: 'Whether in the body
or out of the body these things take
place, I cannot tell: I certainly dare
not affirm on my oath either that the
soul is then in the body, or that the
body can, in the meanwhile, live without
the soul.' Then, making use of
some similitude to explain the matter,
she ends by saying she knows
not what to say. But S. Catherine
of Sienna, herself a divine patient
(<em>Epist. xii. ad P. Raym.</em>), does not
hesitate to affirm for certain that her
soul sometimes left her body and
tasted the sweets of immortality;
which occasional separation of the
soul and body it is manifest could
take place, not by the powers of nature,
but by the omnipotence of
God." I would suggest that separation
or projection would seem to
admit of degrees, some of which may
be possible to other powers short of
omnipotence.</p>

<p>To this phenomenon of projection
I should be inclined to reduce the
majority, if not all, the cases of replication
or bilocation recorded in the
lives of the saints. Benedict XIV.
(<cite>De Beatif.</cite>, lib. iv. pars. i. cap. 32),
when discussing the apparitions of
living saints, is careful to explain that
he is not pretending to entertain the
question of the possibility of "one
and the same body of a living man
being at the same time in two places,
which philosophers call replication."
Both S. Thomas and S. Bonaventure
insist upon the intrinsic impossibility
of the presence of a body "extensive"&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>
clothed in its dimensions&mdash;at the
same time in more than one place.
That this is so, De Lugo, whilst advocating
against Vasquez the contrary
opinion, intrepidly admits. We
may add that the fact of trilocation
being unheard of is, so far, an argument
against the possibility of replication;
for once admit that replication
is possible, and there is no reason for
limiting to duality of presence.</p>

<p>It would seem to be essential to
the phenomenon of projection that
the body remain in a trance during
the process. When simultaneous intelligent
activity has been proved, the
hypothesis is shown to be insufficient.
The best authenticated cases, however,
of so-called bilocation seem to
me to fail precisely in this proof of
simultaneity. Take, for instance, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
wonderful miracles of this kind related
of S. Alphonso Liguori, such
as his preaching in the church and
hearing confessions in the house at
the same time; the possibility either
of his having passed, with miraculous
rapidity of course, from the one
place to the other, or, again, of the
projection of his soul, does not seem
to me to have been fairly disproved.</p>

<p>Setting aside the hypothesis of
replication, the apparitions of saints
simultaneously existing elsewhere
need not be the result of projection,
as it is quite conceivable that they
may be represented by their angels.
This seems to be suggested by S.
Augustine (<cite>De Cura Gerenda pro
Mortuis</cite>, cap. 10). Such representation
would cover simultaneous activity
should this be proved. For the
perfection of the phenomenon of projection,
we require the patient's own
testimony that he and no other has
been consciously acting in some place
where his body was not, and, in default
of witnesses, some proof that he
has been there. For obvious reasons,
such self-testimony is very rare in the
lives of the saints. The most remarkable
I have met with is the following
from the <cite>Life of S. Alphonso Liguori</cite>
(vol. iii. p. 417, Orat. Series). It is
unfortunately defective in there having
been no witnesses at the term of
projection:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In the morning of the 21st of September,
1774, after Alphonso had ended
Mass, contrary to custom, he threw himself
into his arm-chair; he was cast down
and silent, he made no movement of any
sort, never articulated a word, and said
nothing to any one. He remained in
this state all that day and all the following
night; and, during all this time, he
took no nourishment, and did not attempt
to undress. The servants, on seeing
the state he was in, did not know
what was going to happen, and remained
up and at his room door, but no one
dared to enter it.</p>

<p>"On the morning of the 22d, he had not
changed his position; and no one knew
what to think about it. The fact was that
he was in a prolonged ecstasy. However,
when the day became further advanced,
he rang the bell to announce
that he intended to celebrate Mass. This
signal was not only answered by Brother
Francis Anthony, according to custom,
but all the people in the house hurried
to him with eagerness. On seeing so
many people, his lordship asked what
was the matter, with an air of surprise.
'What is the matter?' they replied. 'You
have neither spoken nor eaten anything
for two days, and you ceased to give any
signs of life.' 'That is true,' replied Alphonso;
'but you do not know that I
have been with the Pope, who has just
died.'... Ere long, the tidings of the
death of the Pope Clement were received;
he passed to a better life on the 22d of
September, at seven o'clock in the morning,
at the very moment when Alphonso
came to himself."</p></div>

<p>To all appearances, precisely the
same phenomenon is to be found
both in the diabolical and the natural
order. Innumerable instances
are recorded of diabolical projection.
Here is one quoted by Görres from
Senert (<cite>De Morbis Occultis</cite>): "A woman,
accused of being a were-wolf,
anointed her body in the presence of
the magistrate, who promised her her
life if she would give him a specimen
of her art. Immediately after the
anointing, she fell on the ground, and
slept profoundly. She awoke three
hours after, and, on being asked
where she had been, answered that
she had been changed into a wolf,
and had torn to pieces a sheep and
a cow close to a little village, which
she named, and which was situated
a few miles off. They sent to this
village, and, on inquiry, found that
the mischief she claimed to have perpetrated
was a reality."</p>

<p>The following narrative of presumably
natural projection is characterized
by Görres (<cite>Mystik</cite>, tom. iii.
p. 267, French Trans.) as "very
noteworthy and perfectly authentic":</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Mary, the wife of John Goffe, of Rochester,
was attacked by a lingering illness,
and was removed ten miles from
her home to her father's house at West
Malling, at which place she died June 4,
1691. On the eve of her death, she was
possessed with a great longing to see her
children, whom she had left at home with
their nurse. She besought her husband
to hire a horse, that she might go to Rochester
and die with her children. They
pointed out to her that she was not in a
condition to leave her bed and mount on
horseback. She insisted that anyhow
she would make the attempt. 'If I cannot
sit upright,' said she, 'I will lie down
on the horse; for I must see my dear
little ones.' The clergyman visited her
about ten o'clock at night. She seemed
perfectly resigned to die, and full of confidence
in the divine mercy. 'All that
troubles me,' said she, 'is that I am not
to see my children any more.' Between
one and two in the morning, she had a
kind of ecstasy. According to the statement
of Widow Turner, who was watching
beside her during the night, her eyes
were open and fixed, and her mouth shut.
The nurse put her hand to her mouth and
nostrils, and felt no breath; she therefore
supposed that the sick woman had fainted,
and, indeed, was not clear whether she
was alive or dead. When she came to
herself, she told her mother that she had
been to Rochester, and had seen her children.
'Impossible,' replied the mother;
'you have never for a moment left your
bed.' 'For all that,' rejoined the other,
'I went to-night and saw my children
during my sleep.' The Widow Alexander,
the children's nurse, declared on her
side that, a little before two o'clock in the
morning, she saw Mary Goffe come out
of the room next to hers, where one of the
children was sleeping by itself, with the
door open between them, and enter her
room; and that she remained about a
quarter of an hour close to the bed where
she was lying with the youngest child.
Her eyes moved and her lips looked as
if they were speaking; but she said nothing.
The nurse professed herself willing
to affirm on oath in the presence of
the authorities all that she had said, and
to take the sacrament upon it. She added
that she was perfectly awake, and that the
dawn was beginning to break, as it was
one of the shortest nights of the year.
She sat up in bed, and watched the apparition
attentively. She heard the clock
on the bridge strike two. After a few
moments had passed, she said, 'In the
name of the Father, and the Son, and the
Holy Ghost, who are you?' At these
words, the apparition vanished."</p></div>

<p>Here is another example from Mr.
Varley's evidence (<cite>Report on Spiritualism</cite>):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"My sister-in-law had heart disease.
Mrs. Varley and I went into the country
to see her, as we feared, for the last time.
I had a nightmare, and could not move
a muscle. While in this state, I saw the
spirit of my sister-in-law in the room. I
knew that she was confined to her bed-room.
She said, 'If you do not move,
you will die,' but I could not move; and
she said, 'If you submit yourself to me,
I will frighten you, and you will then be
able to move.' At first I objected, wishing
to ascertain more about her spirit-presence.
When at last I consented, my
heart had ceased beating. I think at
first her efforts to terrify me did not succeed;
but when she suddenly exclaimed,
'O Cromwell! I am dying,' that frightened
me exceedingly, and threw me out
of the torpid state, and I awoke in the
ordinary way. My shouting had aroused
Mrs. Varley; we examined the door, and
it was still locked and bolted, and I told
my wife what had happened, having noted
the hour&mdash;3:45 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>&mdash;and cautioned her
not to mention the matter to anybody,
and to hear what was her sister's version,
if she alluded to the subject. In the
morning, she told us that she had passed
a dreadful night, that she had been in
our room, and greatly troubled on my
account; and that I had been nearly dying.
It was between half-past three and
four when she saw I was in danger. She
only succeeded in rousing me by exclaiming,
'O Cromwell! I am dying.' I
appeared to her to be in a state which
otherwise would have ended fatally."</p></div>

<p>In considering the psychic-force
hypothesis, I have been anxious
to do justice to every slightest
indication of such abnormal power
in the speculations and experiences
of Catholic writers. For this reason,
I have spoken of projection,
although I am not aware that
any attempt has been made by the
advocates of psychic force so to ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>plain
it. Whilst reiterating my belief
that the mind has many mysterious
powers capable of being brought
into active operation by various influences,
and that these are, in all
probability, operative in several of the
phenomena of spiritualism; granting,
moreover, that it is hardly possible
to define precisely the extent of the
soul's co-operation in the production
of these phenomena, I contend, notwithstanding,
that the psychic-force
hypothesis is the result of a non-natural
and inadequate analysis of the phenomena
of spiritualism. For, 1st, in
the form in which it has been presented,
it is indubitably obnoxious to
the charge of being an expedient to
escape a recognition of spiritual influence,
which recognition, in a XIXth-century
man of science, would be so
very unsportsmanlike, to say the
least of it. 2d. It wholly ignores the
sense of personal dualism in spiritual
experience, to which the history of
spiritualism in all ages bears consistent
witness. As the idealist would
convince us that there is no external
world distinct from the phenomena
of sensation, so the advocate of
psychic force would persuade spiritualists
that they have been merely
conversing with their own shadows,
as with real beings who could hear
and answer their questions, and
have attributed to these, as independent
agents, feats which they were
themselves performing. 3d. So far as
we have any indication of a thaumaturgic
element in the mind, it manifests
itself in the supreme efforts of
the imagination, kindled by emotion,
and abstracted and concentrated by
expectation; whereas, in the mass of
spiritualistic experiences, imagination
in those concerned seems distinctly
to fall short of its highest stages.</p>

<p>The third hypothesis remains for
consideration; but, in order to do it
justice, I shall have to enter at some
length into the church notion of
magic and direct diabolical interference;
and this will form the subject
of my second chapter.</p>

<h3>THE SON OF GOD, ARCHETYPAL BEAUTY.</h3>


<p>My heart's voice is to thee, my
Lord and Eternal King, Christ
Jesus. The work of Thy hand dares
to address Thee with loving boldness,
for it yearns after Thy beauty,
and longs to hear Thy voice. O
Thou, my heart's desired One, how
long must I bear Thy absence! How
long must I sigh after Thee, and my
eyes drop tears? O Lord, all love,
all loveable, where dwellest Thou?
Where is the place of Thy rest, where
Thou reposest all joyful among Thy
favorite ones, and satisfiest them
with the revelations of Thy glory?
How happy, how bright, how holy,
how ardently to be longed for, is
that place of perennial joys! My eye
has never reached far enough, nor my
heart soared high enough, to know
the multitude of the sweetnesses which
Thou hast stored up in it for Thy
children. And yet I am supported
by their fragrance, though I am far
away from them. The breath of Thy
sweetness comes to me from afar&mdash;a
sweetness which to me exceeds the
odour of balsam, and the breath of
frankincense and myrrh, and every
kind of sweet smell.&mdash;<em>S. Anselm.</em></p>

<h3>DANTE'S PURGATORIO.<br />

CANTO ELEVENTH.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the Ninth Canto Virgil declares to Dante: <i lang="it">Tu sei omai al Purgatorio giunto</i>-"Thou hast
arrived at Purgatory now!" and it is not until the next Canto that the gate of Purgatory proper
is unfolded to the poet. The first nine Cantos being preliminary, are by Italian critics called the
Ante-Purgatorio.</p>

<p>In the first cornice of the true Purgatory, "<i lang="it">La, dove 'l Purgatorio ha dritto inizio</i>," Dante meets
a procession of spirits crouching under great burdens of stone, in expiation of their sin of pride. As
this Tenth Canto, however, is mostly occupied with an elaborate description of certain sculptures
around the cornice, illustrative of the same deadly sin, and might be less interesting to the readers of
<span class="smcap">The Catholic World</span>, we proceed to the Eleventh, where we are introduced to the spirits of Omberto
Aldobrandeschi, Oderisi the illuminator, and Provenzan Salvani, lord of Sienna. In Omberto the
pride of birth is especially reproved; and in Salvani the pride of place, the arrogance of power.
The sin of Oderisi is of the æsthetic order common to a period of larger culture. Himself an artist,
whose fault was pride of art, he inveighs against the vanity of painters and of poets, and the emptiness
of a present reputation.</p></div>

<h4>NOTE.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the translation of Canto VII., published in the April No. of <span class="smcap">The Catholic World</span>, I proposed
a new rendering of the 74th verse, namely,</p>

<p class="center"><em>India's rich wood, heaven's lucid blue serene</em>,
</p>

<p>for</p>

<p class="center"><i lang="it">Indico legno, lucido e sereno</i>,
</p>

<p>which line I would then have read,</p>

<p class="center"><i lang="it">Indico legno, lucido sereno</i>,
</p>

<p>without the conjunction. I had not found this reading in any edition which fell to my hands, and it
was merely a suggestion of my own to make intelligible what seemed to be unsatisfactory to the sense.</p>

<p>In a late No. (June 14) of the London <cite>Athenæum</cite>, Dr. H. C. Barlow, a very learned Dantean,
confirms my reading by one of the older texts in his library, and also adds that, "in the edition
of the <cite>Divina Commedia</cite> by Paola Costa, we find the reading recently adopted by Mr.
Parsons ... which the editor says is an emendation of Biondi, who has defended it with much learned
reasoning."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Dr. Barlow does not accept this amendment; but believes, with Monti, that Dante
meant to compare the rich and varied hues of a flower-bed to something like charcoal; to wood, clear
and dry; for instance, <em>ebony</em>; and he quotes from Monti this word: "What can be darker than the
night? yet when free from clouds we call it <em>serene</em>." The answer whereto is that when the night
is free from clouds, and starry, or serene, it is <em>not</em> dark, and many objects in nature are blacker
than such a night.</p>

<p>I cannot feel quite so sure of my reading as Dr. Barlow appears to be of his own interpretation,
but I have some confidence that Dante did not mean <em>ebony</em>, for the obvious reason that <em>ebony</em> is not
a brilliant color such as Dante was describing; and the statement which Dr. Barlow takes such
pains to prove, namely, that painters often introduce black for the sake of contrast, does not apply
at all to a verbal description&mdash;"<i lang="it">segnius per aurem</i>," etc.</p>

<p>I am after all inclined to think that the true reading of this much-disputed verse may be</p>

<p class="center"><i lang="it">Indico legno, e lucido sereno</i>,
</p>

<p>but my mind is not made up entirely, and one object of publishing these Cantos in a periodical is
that my version, before it is completed, may have the advantage of critical suggestions, and perhaps
elucidation, in doubtful passages, from the learning and ingenuity of such Italian scholars in England
as Mr. Haselfoot, Dr. Barlow, and Sir Frederic Pollock.</p>

<h3>THE FARM OF MUICERON.</h3>


<p class="center">BY MARIE RHEIL.</p>

<p class="center">FROM THE REVUE DU MONDE CATHOLIQUE.
</p>


<h4>I.</h4>

<p>What I am going to relate to you
is a true story in every respect, seeing
that I had it from my late father&mdash;in
his lifetime the harness-maker
of our hamlet of Val-Saint, and who
was never known to tell a falsehood:
may God have mercy on his soul!</p>

<p>In the village of Ordonniers,
which was the next one to us, and
in our commune, where flows <em>la
Range</em>, lived a farmer named Louis
Ragaud. The maiden name of his
wife was Pierrette Aubry; but after
her marriage, according to our custom,
she was called by every one
La Ragaude.</p>

<p>They were rich, and no one was
jealous of them, as it was known
that they had commenced with nothing,
having been simply servants
in the employ of M. le Marquis de
Val-Saint. Little by little they had
risen, without having injured any
one, always kind to the poor, never
miserly or boasting; so that, when at
the end of twenty years they found
they had saved enough to buy the
beautiful farm of Muiceron, which
they had previously rented, all the
neighbors said: "Behold the true
justice of the good God!"</p>

<p>They had been married a long
time, and had no children. Now,
wealth is a great deal, but not enough
for perfect contentment of heart.
The good man Ragaud had fields
and meadows that yielded rich crops,
strong oxen, and even vines that
bore well&mdash;though it must be acknowledged
that the wines of our
province were not very renowned.
As for the farm buildings, except
those of the château, there were
scarcely any in a circle of six leagues
which were as well kept; and nevertheless,
Ragaud sighed when looking
around him&mdash;no child, alas! and no
family, with the exception of a cousin,
who left for the army more than
thirty years before, and had never
been heard of since; so that, very
naturally, he could not be counted
upon.</p>

<p>La Ragaude sighed still more.
She was good and very devout, but
unable to bear sorrow; and this was
so severe, so constant, it had ended
by destroying all her happiness.
Often, when looking at the neighbors'
children playing before the doors,
she felt her heart throb with pain,
and would hasten to seek refuge in
her own house, where she could give
free vent to her tears. As this happened
more than once, and as she
always reappeared with red eyes, it
had been much remarked, and sundry
comments made. Not that there
is much time to be lost in the fields,
but a reflection here and there
scarcely retards work. There are
even those who say that the tongue
assists the arm, and that gossipping
helps push the plough. It is woman's
tattle, I believe; but a good number
of men here and elsewhere have
the habit of repeating it, and I do
likewise, without inquiring further.</p>

<p>The gossips of the neighborhood&mdash;above
all, those who had larger
families than incomes&mdash;were determined
to find out the true cause
of Pierrette Ragaud's tears; and, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
often happens, preferred seeking for
wicked reasons rather than stop
their babbling.</p>

<p>"It is a thing I cannot understand,"
said one, "why the mistress
of Muiceron is so unhappy that she
weeps constantly&mdash;a woman who is
so well off. We must believe that
things at the farm are not so well as
they appear. Perhaps it is her husband
who makes all the trouble!"</p>

<p>"Her husband! Magdaleine Piédau?"
replied another; "you must
be well put to that you imagine such
a thing. Master Ragaud is the first
workman in the country; and, as for
his using bad words, that he has
never done, any more to his wife
than to others."</p>

<p>"Bah! what you say is true," replied
Magdaleine Piédau; "but all
the same, neighbor, Ragaud can fly
into a rage as well as any other man.
I saw and heard him, day before
yesterday, beside himself with anger
against one of his yoke of oxen.
You know Capitaine, the big black
one? Ah! my dear, I pitied the
poor beast&mdash;he beat him well! without
counting that he swore so that
you would not have known him.
Bah! don't talk to me!"</p>

<p>"Ah! that may be, but I speak
of people. Now, an ox is not a
person!"</p>

<p>"There you are right, thank God!
Men are often rough to beasts, and
very polite to Christians; but, in my
opinion, we must be gentle and
patient to both. A beast that works
well deserves to be well treated,
and Ragaud had no right to beat
his ox. I don't say he would
treat his wife so; but, at least, we
must allow that Pierrette Ragaud
does not always look as if her
life were a holiday. Ah! she has
trouble, that is very sure, poor creature!"</p>

<p>"And the reason?"</p>

<p>"The reason! Go and ask her,
Magdaleine, if you are so curious."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't dare; for, after all, it
don't concern me very much. What
I have said was only in the way of
friendly gossip."</p>

<p>"In that case, we can speak of
other things; for I don't know any
more about it than you. We will
leave it for God to clear up. Go
and catch your boy, who will fall
into the pond, Magdaleine Piédau,
and lend me your sickle, that I may
cut some grass for my cows....
But to think that Ragaud ill-treats his
wife&mdash;no, no; that is out of the question.
After that, where may we
hope to find a good man? One don't
know...."</p>

<p>"No, neighbor, one never knows
how it is with them. You speak like a
priest, my good woman. The deceased
Piédau, my man, that every
one believed so good, ..."</p>

<p>"Good-evening, Magdaleine."</p>

<p>"Was a drunkard and big eater. I
concealed it for ten years, and wept
alone like the mistress of Muiceron."</p>

<p>"Good-evening, neighbor."</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p>One summer day, when La Ragaude
was washing her earthen pans
in the sun, she saw the <i lang="fr">curé</i> of
Ordonniers advancing through the
path in the woods. He was a worthy
priest, beloved by all, and well
deserving of it on account of his
great charity. I have heard it said
that, in the years when bread was so
dear, he gave away his last measure
of wheat, and then, having no more
for himself, was obliged to go to the
miller, Pierre Cotentin, and ask for
some flour on credit.</p>

<p>"It is not my custom," said he
gaily, "and you are not bound to
oblige me; but the times are hard,
and you must never refuse to give
alms, even to your <i lang="fr">curé</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>The miller filled the bag willingly;
and as for the money, although he
was very fond of it, he would never
hear the word mentioned.</p>

<p>Said he, "M. le Curé has an empty
purse. We must not ask him where
the last cent went, poor dear man!
Pierre Cotentin can well feed him&mdash;it
is justice! Who will have the heart
to be jealous?"</p>

<p>And in fact, the <i lang="fr">curé</i> was so respected
that not a boy, no matter
how bad he was, ever failed to take
off his cap when passing him.</p>

<p>When La Ragaude saw the black
cassock coming towards Muiceron,
she quickly arranged her pans, and
threw aside her working-apron; for
she was a careful woman and thorough
housekeeper.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, M. le Curé; how
are you?" she asked joyfully.</p>

<p>"Very warm, very warm," replied
the <i lang="fr">curé</i>; "otherwise, well."</p>

<p>"My dear monsieur, why did you
not wait until the cool of the evening
to do us the honor of visiting
us? It is roasting in the road. I
thought just now I would send a servant
to replace my husband in the
fields. A storm is rising, the flies
bite, Ragaud is not as strong as he
was at twenty, and I am afraid of
the beasts&mdash;they are difficult to control
when they become impatient."</p>

<p>"Ah! your husband is absent?"</p>

<p>"Have you something to say to
him, monsieur?"</p>

<p>"To him and to you also, my
good woman."</p>

<p>"Come in and refresh yourself,"
said she.</p>

<p>M. le Curé entered, and took a
seat near the table. He appeared
preoccupied, and answered like a
man who did not hear what was
said to him. He even placed his
cane against the bread-box, and his
hat on top&mdash;something which he had
never done before, as the slightest
motion might have sent them to the
floor. When he put his hand in his
pocket for his breviary, he found he
had forgotten it, which embarrassed
him not a little; as, it must be said,
no man was more exact and particular
than he in words as well as in
actions.</p>

<p>La Ragaude, not being a fool by
nature, quietly replaced the cane and
hat in a safe place, but was, in her
turn, very much astonished to see the
<i lang="fr">curé</i> so absent, as it was the first
time it had ever happened; and from
that concluded he must have something
in his head of great importance.
What could it be?</p>

<p>While busying herself around the
room, without showing it, Pierrette
Ragaud had distractions also. She
drew new wine for cider, and washed
a glass which had not been used.
But that I do not believe she would
have perceived then or afterwards;
for she was so accustomed to scrub
everything you could have used the
side walls of the stable for a mirror.</p>

<p>M. le Curé tasted the wine through
civility, but, as he said nothing, she
began to feel rather impatient. Women
are curious. My deceased father
was accustomed to say, from
that came all the evil from the commencement
of the world. It is true
the dear man was rather in his dotage
towards the end; but it is also
true that I have heard others say
the same thing.</p>

<p>Pierrette at last commenced to
question the <i lang="fr">curé</i> very respectfully
and gently; for, in truth, she could
no longer restrain herself.</p>

<p>"Although the master is out, M.
le Curé," said she, "will you not
tell me what I can do to serve you?&mdash;without
pressing to know, you understand,
monsieur."</p>

<p>M. le Curé raised his eyes, and
replied as gravely as though he were
preaching a sermon:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have come to know, in the
name of the good God, Mme.
Ragaud, if you are disposed to act
charitably."</p>

<p>"Oh! if it is to aid those who
are suffering and in need, my husband
and I will be most happy to
assist you," frankly cried La Ragaude,
who spoke with her whole heart and
soul. "Thank God! there is yet
money in the drawer. Tell me how
much you want, monsieur."</p>

<p>The good <i lang="fr">curé</i> shook his head,
laughing, and repeated two or three
times, "Good, good," which was a
sign that he was pleased.</p>

<p>"You are always ready to give
money to the poor, I know," said
he; "but to-day that is not the
question. I have come to ask you
for something of greater importance."</p>

<p>"More so than money! Heaven
of our Lord!" said Pierrette, slightly
amazed. "I do not know, M. le
Curé, how, then, I can oblige you."</p>

<p>She said that, although she had a
generous heart; but money with us
is always the great affair. In the
fields, as in the city, the poor man
who eats his bread while working
knows that the francs are not picked
up under the horses' feet.</p>

<p>"Money," replied M. le Curé,
"when the soul is wanting in charity,
is given, and there it ends; but
what I have come to ask of you is
a good work which will not end for
a long while, and which will need
good-will, and great patience especially,
on your part."</p>

<p>"I can guess what it is," said
Pierrette.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" replied the <i lang="fr">curé</i>.
"Well, that spares me the difficulty
of explaining myself. Let us hear,
Mme. Ragaud, what you have
guessed."</p>

<p>"I have heard it said you were
very much worried about your surplices
and altar-linens, since Catharine
Luguet left the country so
shamefully, like a good-for-nothing
girl, to seek her fortune in Paris,"
said La Ragaude, blushing&mdash;for this
Catharine was a distant cousin&mdash;"and
doubtless, M. le Curé, you
wish me to replace her, and take
charge of the sacristy."</p>

<p>"And if it were so, would you
refuse me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, monsieur. I
would willingly do my best to please
you. Not that I have as light a
hand as Catharine for plaiting and
folding; but for washing and ironing,
I can say, without boasting, I am
the equal of any one."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the <i lang="fr">curé</i>. "I
accept an offer made so willingly.
But to speak truly, I have not come
for that."</p>

<p>"Then," replied Pierrette, in astonishment,
"I cannot imagine
what you want me to do."</p>

<p>"This is it," said the <i lang="fr">curé</i>, taking
a serious tone: "This morning,
Pierrette, a bundle was left at my
house...."</p>

<p>"I bet," cried La Ragaude, "it
was the beautiful monstrance promised
by M. le Marquis for Corpus
Christi!"</p>

<p>"No, it was a new-born infant, a
beautiful boy, Mme. Ragaud; and,
since the good God has allowed
you to remain childless, and that
this privation has greatly afflicted
you, I immediately thought he destined
this child for you."</p>

<p>"Monsieur," replied Pierrette,
with emotion, "it is true that it is
very hard for me to be alone in the
house, and to think that I will die
and leave no one after me to inherit
Muiceron; but I prefer it to working
all my life for a child sprung,
perhaps, from a wicked race."</p>

<p>"I know where it comes from,"
said the <i lang="fr">curé</i>; "but still I can tell
you nothing, as it is a secret of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
confessional. But have confidence in
me; as for the race, it is not bad."</p>

<p>"It is the same thing. I don't believe
in these foundlings."</p>

<p>"Say nothing further about it,"
replied the <i lang="fr">curé</i> rather sadly; "I
will send it to the hospital."</p>

<p>And then, without appearing to
feel either pique or bitterness, M. le
Curé commenced to converse on
other subjects, speaking of the next
harvest, the price of the new wine,
and of the last fair, with even voice
and kind looks, that showed plainly
he did not wish his parishioner to
think he was pained by her rather
prompt refusal.</p>

<p>This kindness of a heart truly
charitable had more effect on good
Pierrette than reproaches or scolding.
She did her best to reply to
the <i lang="fr">curé</i>, but her eyes were wet
against her will, and soon she became
so absent-minded the <i lang="fr">curé</i> with
difficulty repressed his mirth, seeing
that he had gained ground by the
ell, without seeming to do it intentionally.</p>

<p>"You see," said he, "by often
hearing the bells ring, one becomes
a bell-ringer; and as I love all my
parishioners, like a true pastor, I go
everywhere, inquiring and advising,
so that I may be useful in case of
need. In that way, Mme. Ragaud,
without ever having driven a plough
or taken care of cattle, God has given
me the grace of being able to advise
on all rural subjects, as well as the
first master-farmer in the neighborhood.
Thus, I will say to you:
'When there are more pears than
apples, keep your wine, good man.'
This is a country proverb hundreds
of years old. Now, as this year there
are more pears than they know what
to do with, believe me, keep your
vintage, and you will have news to
tell me of it by next Easter."</p>

<p>"I do not know how Ragaud will
decide," replied Pierrette; "he is
always afraid when the cellar is
full...."</p>

<p>"The proverb never fails, my
good woman; and that is easily
understood when one reflects how
and why proverbs have obtained
credit."</p>

<p>"But, M. le Curé," interrupted La
Ragaude, "if you knew where this
poor abandoned child came from, it
seems to me...."</p>

<p>"What child?" said the <i lang="fr">curé</i>,
taking a pinch of snuff, so as to
appear indifferent. "Oh! yes, the
little one of this morning. What,
do you still think of it? Bah! let it
pass; after all, the hospital is not a
place where one dies from want of
care."</p>

<p>"I know it; but it is sad, monsieur,
very sad, for one of those little
innocents to say afterwards, 'I was
in a hospital'; that always gives a
bad idea."</p>

<p>"What can be done, Mme.
Ragaud? One becomes accustomed
to everything. Come, come, don't
make yourself uneasy. We were saying,
then, ... what were we saying?
Ah! I remember now. I was
telling you that proverbs must be
believed, and for the reason that
these little village-sayings are only
repeated after they have been verified
by the great and long experience
of our fathers. Thus, you will see
that the last part of the one I just
quoted is equally curious: 'When
there are more apples than pears,
then, good man, you can drink.'
Well, wasn't it a fact last year?
There were so many apples that a
jug of cider was only worth two
farthings; there was enough for everybody,
and the wine was so abundant
that&mdash;you are not listening to me,
Pierrette Ragaud?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, M. le Curé, I am
listening attentively; but I was think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>ing
perhaps my husband would not
return; and, nevertheless, he should
have a little talk with you."</p>

<p>"About the vintage? We have
time enough until then for that,"
replied the <i lang="fr">curé</i> with a spice of
malice.</p>

<p>"About the little innocent, dear
monsieur. The truth is, I feel my
heart ache when I think he will go
to the hospital through my fault."</p>

<p>"And as for me, my good woman,
I am sorry that I spoke to you about
it; yes, sorry," he repeated earnestly,
"for I have worried you, and I
had no such intention when I came
to visit you. I see now that you
are inclined on the side of the good
work; but I don't wish to force you
to take it in hand. Here, now, if
the hospital frightens you, I have
thought of another arrangement,
which might work well. My old
Germaine, notwithstanding her thirty
years of service, is still active, and
the work in my house don't kill her.
We will buy a good milking-goat at
the August fair; until then, you will
lend us one, and, God willing, the
little one will remain where his good
angel deposited him."</p>

<p>"May the Lord bless you!" cried
La Ragaude, the tears streaming from
her eyes. "But what a shame for us
to let you burden yourself with such
a heavy load, when you already give
more than you can afford! No, no,
holy and good Virgin Mary! For my
part, I would not sleep easy after
such an act."</p>

<p>The good <i lang="fr">curé</i> clasped his hands,
and in his heart rendered thanks to
all the saints in paradise. He was
very much touched, and as he was
about to thank Pierrette as she deserved,
Ragaud returned from the
fields.</p>

<p>They cordially saluted each other;
and, very naturally, as the good man
saw his wife wiping her eyes, and the
<i lang="fr">curé</i> almost ready to do likewise, he
asked what had excited them. Thereupon
M. le Curé commenced a long
discourse, so gentle and so touching&mdash;he
spoke of charity, of the rewards of
heaven, the happiness of generous
hearts, with words so beautifully turned
that never in the parish church,
on the greatest festivals, had he
preached better. Pierrette, as she
afterwards said, thought she was listening
to the holy patron saint of
Ordonniers, who in his lifetime, it is
related, spoke so well that the birds
stopped singing to listen to him.
Ragaud remained silent, but he shook
his head, and turned his cap around
in his hands&mdash;signs of great emotion
with him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he said neither yes nor
no, but asked time for reflection, promising
to give his answer the next
day before twelve o'clock. He was
perfectly right, and M. le Curé, who
felt in the bottom of his heart that
the cause was gained, wished even to
wait until Sunday; but Ragaud did
not like to take back his word.</p>

<p>"I said to-morrow, M. le Curé, and
it will be to-morrow," said he, when
conducting his pastor to the threshold
of the door.</p>

<p>"Dear, holy soul of the good God!"
cried Pierrette, looking after the <i lang="fr">curé</i>
as he leisurely walked down the road,
repeating his rosary as he went along.
"Good dear priest, that he is! We
need many more like him, Ragaud!"</p>

<p>"Good, holy man, in truth," replied
the farmer; "but what he proposes
to us is an affair of importance.
You are young and healthy yet,
wife, but in ten years your arms will
not be as strong as now. You must
think of that, even if God keeps you
in good health. A child is a comfort
in a house, but all the burden falls
on the mother. Suppose this little
one should become refractory and
vagabond, like Cotentin's son."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is true," said La Ragaude.</p>

<p>"Suppose he should get bad ideas
in his head, and send religion and
honesty to the devil."</p>

<p>"That would be a great misfortune,"
again said La Ragaude, but this
time sighing.</p>

<p>"I know you," continued the good
man&mdash;"you become attached to every
one. Didn't you weep like a little girl
because I beat Capitaine, who is only
an ox, and who deserved it? And haven't
I seen you half crazy because Brunette
had the gripes?&mdash;and she was
only a cow.... Can it be hoped that
you would be more reasonable about
a child who would become ours?&mdash;for
we must do the thing well or not at
all; isn't it so?"</p>

<p>"It is just as you say," replied
Pierrette, sighing still louder; "but
what, then, shall we do?"</p>

<p>"My opinion is that we must consider
it well," answered Ragaud.</p>

<p>"You only consider the bad side,"
said La Ragaude gently; "but suppose
the little one should preserve the
blessing of his baptism, and let himself
be well governed&mdash;later, we would be
very happy and well rewarded."</p>

<p>"That is true," said the farmer.</p>

<p>"If," continued La Ragaude, "I
am easily worried about animals, I
know well it would not be the same
thing with a Christian. You see,
husband, the poor beasts suffer without
being able to complain or explain
themselves; and, therefore, I am
always afraid of their being treated
unjustly. But a boy has his tongue,
and can defend himself. We can talk
sense to him, and if he won't listen,
why, we will put him to school."</p>

<p>"Bah! you will spoil him so that
he will be master of the house before
he is in breeches."</p>

<p>"Don't fear," cried Pierrette; "that
will never be, or I should think myself
wanting in gratitude to the good
God."</p>

<p>"If I could be sure of that, my
wife, I would attempt it. But, come;
let the night pass before deciding."</p>

<p>They did not mention it again
until the next day; but Pierrette took
care, before retiring, to light a taper
at her bedside, beneath a beautiful
picture of Our Lady of Liesse.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, she went,
as usual, to feed her turkeys and
drive her cows to the meadow. On
her return, she saw Ragaud dressing
himself in his Sunday clothes.</p>

<p>"I think, wife," said he, "we had
better, at least, see this little one before
deciding."</p>

<p>Pierrette hastened to throw aside
her apron; and then it appeared she
had expected such a decision, as at
dawn she had dressed herself in
her new gown of gray serge, with
her bright-flowered neckerchief from
Rouen, which had only been worn
at the last feast of the good S. Anne,
in July.</p>

<p>It was thus the worthy couple proceeded
on their way to the priest's
house. As it was Thursday, and
neither festival, nor fair, nor market-day
in the village, the neighbors stared
as they saw them pass, and, unable
to imagine the cause, chattered nonsense,
half from malice, half from
spite; and Simonne Durand, well
known for her viper tongue, said
aloud: "We must believe the Ragauds
are going to obtain the priest's
blessing on their fiftieth anniversary,
as they are so finely dressed on a
week-day."</p>

<p>This wicked jealousy went a little
too far, and profited nothing to the
spiteful thing, as every one knew
the Ragauds had only been married
twenty years at the furthest; but,
when the mind is full of malice, there
is little time for reflection.</p>

<p>When the good friends arrived at
the pastoral residence, M. le Curé had
just entered after saying his Mass;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
and we need not ask if he had prayed
well. Germaine, his old servant,
held the baby in her lap, and was
feeding him with boiled goat's milk.
Pierrette could not restrain her delight
on seeing what a beautiful child
it was, and that it was at least six or
seven months old. She snatched it
from Germaine's arms, and commenced
kissing it, not caring that she had
interrupted his little repast. This
showed that the child was good-natured;
for instead of crying, as a sickly,
cross baby would have done similarly
situated, he crowed with joy,
and put out his little hands, dazzled
with the fine, flowered neckerchief of
his new mamma.</p>

<p>"How pretty and healthy he is!"
cried La Ragaude. "My dear M. le
Curé, you told me it was a new-born
child."</p>

<p>"Did I say so, Pierrette? It was
because I did not know much about
it."</p>

<p>"So it seems," replied the good
woman, gaily. "The little darling is
at least seven or eight months old;
don't you think so, Germaine?"</p>

<p>"I know one a year old not so
large as he," answered the old servant.
"But that is not all, Mme. Ragaud;
you see him in the day-time,
but it is at night that he is good and
amusing. He sleeps without stirring,
like a little corpse. For my part, I
would not be afraid to bring him up."</p>

<p>Ragaud had not yet said a word,
and still upon him all depended.</p>

<p>"Come and talk a little while with
M. le Curé," said he, pulling his wife
by the skirt.</p>

<p>Pierrette quickly rose to obey him,
according to her good habit, but she
did not give up the young one; so
that Ragaud gently reproved her for
again showing herself as ready to become
attached to men as to beasts.</p>

<p>We need not be sorcerers to divine
what happened. In less than a quarter
of an hour, the contract of adoption
was passed satisfactorily, without
notary or scribbling. It was signed
with a friendly shake of the hands;
and to say which one of these good
hearts was the best satisfied would
not be very easy.</p>


<h4>III.</h4>

<p>Now, without further delay, I am
going to show you, as they say, the
under-card in relation to the little
one. True, it was a secret of the
confessional, at least for the time
being; but later, it was everybody's
secret. The story is simple, and will
not be long. You remember that
our <i lang="fr">curé</i>, in conversation with Pierrette,
led her to mention a certain
Catharine Luguet, against whom the
good woman appeared very much
incensed. This Catharine was an
orphan, whose parents, dying, left her
when quite young without any means
of support. Germaine watched over
her like a daughter, and M. le Curé,
to keep her near him, paid her apprenticeship
to a seamstress; after
which, having grown up, and being
very skilful with her needle, he placed
her in a little room near the church,
and gave her charge of the sacristy.
But, unfortunately, the poor child
was as pretty as a picture, and loved
compliments, dress, and dancing,
which is a great danger for a young
girl, especially in a village. Catharine
commenced by degrees to make
people talk about her, and not without
cause. The Ragauds, who were
distantly related to her on the
mother's side, at first reprimanded
her, and finally would not see her.
The girl was quick-tempered, resented
the treatment, and one fine day went
off, saying that she could easily find
in Paris people who would be happy
to receive her.</p>

<p>Two years passed without news of
her. Her name was no longer men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>tioned
in the village, and from that
M. le Curé surmised some misfortune
had happened. He prayed for the
poor girl, and unceasingly begged
the good God to mercifully receive
her through his grace, if not during
her life, at least at the hour of death.
His prayer was heard at a moment
when he scarcely expected it. One
morning, when Germaine had left the
village at day-dawn to make some
purchases in the city, she took it into
her head to pay a visit to one of her
good friends, who was a Gray Sister in
a large hospital. They talked about
the patients; and the sister, very much
affected, spoke of a young woman
she had received the week before,
and who appeared very near her end.</p>

<p>"I have put her by herself," said
she, "and I will confide to you, Germaine,
that this poor afflicted creature
has a child; and, between ourselves,
I very much believe she is dying as
much of shame as of want."</p>

<p>Germaine wished to see her; but,
at the first look, the sick woman
uttered a loud cry, and hid her head
under the counterpane.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" said Germaine.
"I frighten her."</p>

<p>"We have awakened her," replied
the good sister, "and she is
nervous. I should have entered
alone."</p>

<p>But the poor girl sobbed without
showing her face. At last the sister
calmed her. Germaine, on her side,
spoke kindly, and finally she drew
down the covering. You can imagine
the rest.</p>

<p>It was Catharine Luguet, but how
changed! She, formerly so pretty,
so bright, and so laughing&mdash;and now
her mother herself would scarcely
have recognized her. The innocent
little being that slept in a cradle by
her side told all her story. What she
had found in Paris, what had brought
her back to the country, there to
die, were dishonor, misery, and an
orphan without a name&mdash;but also
sincere and true repentance; and the
good God, who has certainly received
her in paradise, struck the blow, that
she might be saved.</p>

<p>Who was astonished, and at heart
happy, in spite of his sorrow, which
can be well understood? It was our
<i lang="fr">curé</i>. Holy man that he was, he was
happier to have his lost sheep
brought back to him, even although
half dead, than not to have found
her at all. The next day, he hastened
to Issoudun, and remained the
greater part of the afternoon with
poor Catharine.</p>

<p>Issoudun was the nearest large
city to our village, and, if I have forgotten
to tell you so, I beg you will
excuse me.</p>

<p>Although my father gave me some
slight details of the unfortunate girl's
story, I will not relate them; for
many long years she has reposed in
consecrated ground, and, as the dear,
good man wisely said, "The sins
which have received the pardon of
God should be hidden by man;"
and this is true charity.</p>

<p>It is only necessary to say that
this first visit of our <i lang="fr">curé</i> was followed
by many others. Catharine
declined visibly, and her little one,
from whom she would not be separated,
was a great worry to her.
The sisters took care of him, and
fed him to the best of their ability
during the day, but they could not
attend to him at night. He was
beautiful and healthy, and grew like
a weed&mdash;which was a miracle, considering
the state of the mother&mdash;but
his first teeth commenced to appear,
and rendered him restless and troublesome.
One morning, when M. le
Curé and Germaine went together to
the hospital, they found poor Catharine
so ill they feared she would not
pass the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>"My daughter," said Germaine to
her, "be reasonable; let me have
your child. I will take great care of
him."</p>

<p>"As you please," replied Catharine.</p>

<p>He was instantly carried away;
and, that no one should penetrate
the secret, a confidential woman,
employed in the hospital, came in
the night-time, and left him at the
priest's house in the village. That
same night, poor Catharine became
speechless, but was conscious until
the moment of her death, which soon
happened, and never was there seen
a more peaceful and touching agony.
The sisters saw with admiration
that after death she regained her
beauty, and her face its youthful
look of twenty years.</p>

<p>"She is smiling with the angels,"
said the pious souls, and it was not
to be doubted; for the angels receive
with as great joy the repentant
as the innocent.</p>

<p>The little one was baptized and
registered under the name of his
poor mother. Our <i lang="fr">curé</i> easily procured
all the necessary acts; but for
the family name, the dear innocent
had none to bear, at least for a long
time. He was called Jean-Louis;
about the rest, there was silence.
As to the secret of his birth, although
confided in confession, Catharine, before
dying, said to the <i lang="fr">curé</i>:</p>

<p>"You will tell all, my father, if it
is necessary, later, for the future of
my child."</p>

<p>And you will see in the end that
it was a wise speech.</p>

<p>Between ourselves, this holy, good
man of a <i lang="fr">curé</i>, who was gentle and
merciful, as much from a sense of
duty as by inclination of heart, had
always blamed the Ragauds for their
rigorous severity against the poor departed.
Says the proverb, "In trying
to do too much, one often fails to do
well." Perhaps it would have been
better to have patiently borne with
the poor inexperienced girl than to
have driven her from the protection
of her only relatives on account of
malicious gossip. But Ragaud did
not understand jesting; he was, as the
saying runs, as stiff as a poker, and,
as soon as the wicked tongues commenced
to wag about her, he said,
"There is no smoke without fire,"
and closed his mind to all explanations,
and his door to the girl. Thus
had they acted towards Catharine,
without thinking that then she was
only giddy and coquettish&mdash;faults
which might have been cured as
long as the soul was not spoiled.
The treatment was too harsh; it
caused the flight to Paris, which
took place in a moment of anger and
spite, and all the misfortunes that
followed. In strict justice, the Ragauds
should in a measure make reparation
for an action done with good
intentions, but which had ended
so badly. Our <i lang="fr">curé</i> foresaw that
sooner or later they would be sorry
for it; therefore, in burdening them
with the child, he acted shrewdly,
but also with great fairness. I certainly
will not blame him, nor you
either, I think.</p>


<h4>IV.</h4>

<p>From the day that poor Catharine's
child was installed in the house of
her relatives, there was a change in
Muiceron. Pierrette no longer wept,
and, far from being grieved, as formerly,
at the sight of other children, she
willingly drew them around her. On
Saturdays, when she baked her bread
for the week, she never failed to
make a large crumpet of wheaten
flour, beaten up with eggs, and a
bowl of curds and fresh cream, for
the sole purpose of regaling the
young ones of the neighborhood.
We need not inquire if, on these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
evenings, the house was full. The
children were well satisfied, and their
mammas also; for Saturday's supper
remained whole for Sunday, and, in
the meantime, the little rascals went
to bed gayer than usual, thanks to
a glass of white wine that watered
the crumpet and filled the measure
of joy in all those little heads.</p>

<p>It was also remarked that Ragaud's
jests were more frequent at the
meetings of the church wardens of
the parish on the appointed days
after Vespers. Sometimes he even
went off in the morning to his work
singing the airs of the country-dances,
which was a sure proof that his heart
was at peace; for, by nature, he was
a man more serious than gay, and as
for singing, that was something quite
out of his usual habit.</p>

<p>These good people thus already
received a holy reward for their
generous conduct. According to the
old adage, "Contentment is better
than wealth"; and now they, who
had so long possessed riches without
contentment, had the happiness of
enjoying both. Quite contrary to
many Christians, who imagine that
the good God owes them everything,
the Ragauds every evening thanked
Heaven for this increase of wealth.
Now, if gratitude is pleasing to men,
it is easy to believe that it draws
down blessings from on high; and
from day to day this could be clearly
seen at Muiceron.</p>

<p>Little Jean-Louis grew wonderfully,
and gave good Pierrette neither
trouble nor care. At his age, children
only cry from hunger, and as
he, well fed and well cared for, had
nothing to complain of, it followed
that he grew up scarcely ever shedding
a tear.</p>

<p>When he was one year old, it
seemed that the good boiled goat's
milk was no longer to his taste, as he
put on a discontented look when he
saw the smoking bowl. Ragaud, one
evening, for a joke, put his glass to
the boy's lips, and, far from turning
his head, he came forward boldly,
and drank the cider like a man.
This highly delighted Master Ragaud,
who wished to try if a piece
of dry pork, in the shape of a rattle,
would please him as well; but to
that Pierrette objected, maintaining
that a root of marsh-mallow was a
hundred times better, particularly as
the little fellow was getting his double
teeth.</p>

<p>"You wish to bring him up like a
woman," said Ragaud, shrugging his
shoulders; but, nevertheless, he let
the mistress have her own way.</p>

<p>There were no other disputes about
him until he had attained his third
year, for then his excellent health,
which had caused so much happiness,
was nothing in comparison with
the good instincts which commenced
to develop. He was lively and gentle,
chattered away delightfully, and
was always so obedient and tender,
that to pay him for his good behavior,
the Ragauds nearly killed him
with kindness. In regard to his appearance,
I will tell you that in
height he surpassed most children of
his age, his hair was black and curly,
his eyes dark also and very bright.
With all this, he was not very handsome,
as, growing so fast, he had kept
very thin; but Pierrette said wisely,
he would have time to grow fat, and
since he ate, drank, and slept when
he was tired, there was nothing to
fear.</p>

<p>One thing will astonish you, that
neither of the Ragauds perceived for
an instant that the child was the
living image of poor Catharine Luguet;
and still the likeness was so
striking, M. le Curé spoke of it incessantly
to Germaine, and expected
on every visit to Muiceron to be
embarrassed by some remark on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
subject. But whether the good people
had really forgotten their relative, or
did not wish by even pronouncing her
name to recall a sorrowful remembrance,
certain it is that nothing in
their words or actions, which were
perfectly frank and simple, betrayed
in the slightest degree that they ever
thought of it.</p>

<p>About that time, Pierrette commenced
to be more uneasy, as Master
Jean-Louis often escaped on the
side of the stables, and delighted in
racing up and down the bank, bordered
with tall grass, of the stream
that ran behind the bleaching-ground
of Muiceron. With such
a bold boy, who would not listen
to any warning, an accident very
often happens; therefore, the good
woman placed around his neck a
medal of S. Sylvain, in addition to
that of the Blessed Virgin Mary,
which he had worn ever since his
arrival at the farm.</p>

<p>S. Sylvain is a patron saint venerated
in our province, who won heaven
in leading the life of a peasant
like us. Pierrette had a great devotion
for him, and said that the saints
above remember with tenderness
those of their own former condition
on earth; consequently, no one in
the good God's heaven could better
protect a child daily exposed to the
accidents of rural life. One day especially,
when he wished to be very
active in helping his mother Pierrette
by putting little pieces of dry wood
in the fire, while she was soaking the
clothes in lye, a plank of the big tub
gave way all at once, and the boiling
water floated around the room, and
only stopped within half a foot of the
child, who might have been drowned
and scalded, in less time than it takes
to say it. Pierrette for two entire
days was so overcome she could
speak of nothing else.</p>

<p>In the same manner, once, when
Ragaud carried the little fellow with
him to the fields, he amused him by
placing him on one of the oxen; but
the animal, tormented by the flies,
shook his head so roughly that his
rider, about as high as your boot, was
thrown on the ground; but before any
one could run to assist him he was
already standing, red, not with fear,
but with anger, and quickly revenged
himself on the beast by striking him
with a willow-wand that he used
for a whip, and which he had not let
go in his fall. Ragaud was terribly
frightened at the time, but afterwards
proudly related the adventure, and
said to his neighbors that his son,
Jean Louis, would be as brave a man
as General Hoche, the hero of the
war of La Vendée, and who, according
to the old men of the neighborhood,
never in his lifetime feared
either man or beast.</p>

<p>As for the resemblance to General
Hoche, Pierrette cared precious little,
not being the least warlike by nature.
Truth to say, I scarcely believe she
knew precisely who was this very
great personage, notwithstanding his
immense renown in the province;
therefore, she simply contented herself
with having a Mass of thanksgiving
said in S. Sylvain's Chapel, thinking
that his protection was worth
more than all the vanities of this world.</p>

<p>The great love of this good household
for the little orphan increased
day by day. Pierrette and her
husband accustomed themselves to
call him "My son" so often and so
sincerely that I do believe they really
ended by fancying it was so.
The neighbors could do no less than
they; so that every where and by
every one he was called the Ragauds'
son&mdash;so true it is that custom often
takes away reflection.</p>

<p>From that grew the idea that this
little mite would one day be the big
man of the neighborhood; and those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
who thought they were making a
wise discovery, in supposing it would
be thus, fell into the intentions of the
Ragauds, as surely as the brook flows
into the river; for at this same time,
one autumn evening, when the fire
burnt brightly on the hearth, Ragaud,
seated at table opposite his good
wife, commenced all at once to compliment
her talent for housekeeping,
praising everything around him, from
the walls and window-panes, glistening
with cleanliness, to the chests
and benches, newly waxed once a
month. He took pleasure in recalling
his great happiness during the past
twenty years, attributing all his blessings,
after God, to the account of Pierrette's
virtues; and as, like the thread
in a needle, Jean Louis was sitting between
them, eating his soup, he seized
him in his arms, and tossed him up
three times nearly to the rafters.</p>

<p>"You see, my son," said he, re-seating
himself, and still keeping the
boy on his knees, "you drew a
good number in the lottery; for
although you came to us like the
down off the thistle, you have, nevertheless,
a mother such as cannot be
found in a hundred leagues; and as
for your father, my brave fellow, he
will leave you enough crowns to make
you as respected in life as though you
were a prefect."</p>

<p>"Happily," replied the wise Pierrette,
"the little one is not old enough
to understand what you are talking
about; for this, my dear husband,
is a very improper speech for the
child's ears. We would fill him
with vanity, and not only does pride
offend the good God, but it renders
a man very disagreeable to those
around him."</p>

<p>"You are always right," replied
Ragaud, without taking offence;
"but a good fire, a good wife, money
honestly earned, and new cider&mdash;nothing
like these for untying the
tongue and making it a little too
long. Come, go to bed, my Jeannet,
kiss your parents, and say your prayers
well; to-morrow we will go to
gather the thatch in the fields near
Ordonniers, and if you only bring
me as much as will fill your apron,
you shall have two cents on Sunday
to buy a gingerbread."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Pierrette, laughing,
"that will be a fortune which
will not make him too vain."</p>

<p>A little while afterwards, when they
were alone, the conversation was recommenced,
but they proceeded regularly
about the business, and, finally,
debated the question as to how the will
should be drawn, according to law,
so as to leave Muiceron to the child.
The difficulty was that Ragaud knew
very little about writing in any shape,
and Pierrette nothing at all. They
talked away, without making any progress,
far into the night, and at last
acknowledged they would have to
finish where they should have begun,
namely, by going next day to consult
Master Perdreau, the notary of
Val-Saint, on the subject. Thereupon,
they went off well pleased to
sleep in their big bed, with the canopy
of yellow serge; and as the next
morning the work of the thatching
pressed, on account of the rains which
were about to commence, Ragaud
postponed his trip to another day.</p>

<p>Now, the good God, who has
his own designs, permitted that it
should be entirely otherwise from
what these good people had intended,
and in a manner so astonishing
that no one, no matter how wise,
could have foreseen it; for La Ragaude,
who had nearly completed her
forty-second year, became the following
year the mother of a beautiful
little girl, who was most fondly welcomed
by the delighted parents.</p>

<h3>PHILOSOPHICAL TERMINOLOGY.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></h3>


<h4>II.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">To the Editor of The Catholic
World</span>:</p></div>

<p>In the letter which I ventured to
address to you a short time ago
concerning the general conditions
required in a good English work of
philosophy, I made some observations
on the importance and difficulty of
wielding the popular language in a
strictly philosophical manner. As I
apprehend that the title of "Philosophical
Terminology," under which
that letter was made to appear, is
scarcely justified by its very limited
contents, I beg leave to add a few
other considerations on the same
subject, that your intelligent readers
may find in these additional remarks
a confirmation and a further development
of what I said about our need
of a more copious philosophical language.</p>

<p>There are two words which cannot
easily be dispensed with in the
metaphysical analysis of created beings;
these two words are, in Latin,
<i lang="fr">actus</i> and <em>potentia</em>. Metaphysicians,
in fact, conclusively prove that in
every created substance there are
two essential principles: a principle
of activity, which is known under the
name of <i lang="fr">actus</i>, and a principle of
passivity, which is styled <em>potentia</em>.
These two terms, which are so necessary
in metaphysics, and so familiar
to all the scholastic philosophers,
might be fairly represented in English
by "act" and "potency"; though
as yet neither "act" nor "potency"
is popularly used in this philosophical
sense.</p>

<p>The word "act" with us primarily
signifies that which is produced by
action; for all action is the production,
or the position, or the making
of an act. But all action implies an
agent&mdash;that is, a being which is already
"in act," with its actual power
prepared for action. On the other
hand, nothing is formally "in act,"
but through an intrinsic "act," which
is the formal principle of its actuality.
Accordingly, the word "act," though
primarily known to us as expressing
the product of action, must, by metaphysical
necessity, be applied also
to that from which every agent and
every being has its actuality.</p>

<p>Hence, philosophers found it
necessary to admit two kinds of
"acts"&mdash;the <em>essential</em> and the <em>accidental</em>.
The essential is that which gives
the first actuality, or existence, to a
being&mdash;<i lang="la">dat esse simpliciter</i>. The accidental
is that which is received
in a subject already existing, and
which only gives it an accidental
actuality or a mode of being&mdash;<i lang="la">dat
esse secundum quid</i>.</p>

<p>But the essential act (which is
also called <em>substantial</em>, though it has
a more extensive meaning, as we
shall see hereafter) is, moreover, to be
distinguished from actual existence.
Metaphysicians, indeed, very often
speak of existence as an act; and
hence, to avoid confusion and
equivocation, they are obliged to
distinguish the <i lang="la">actus essentiæ</i> from
the <i lang="la">actus existentiæ</i>. Yet, to speak
properly, existence is not simply an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
act; it is the actuality of the being;<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
and, consequently, the distinction
which must be admitted between the
essential act and the existence of
a being is not strictly a distinction
between two acts, but between the <em>act</em>
which actuates the essential term of
the being, and the <em>actual state</em> which
results from such an actuation. I
will say more on this point when I
have explained the use of the word
"potency."</p>

<p>The English word "potency" is
the equivalent of the Latin <em>potentia</em>.
This Latin word, although used most
frequently in the sense of "passive
principle," is not, however, necessarily
connected with passivity more than
with activity; and accordingly it has
been used as well to designate
"active power." Hence, it is obvious
that this term, <em>potentia</em>, when employed
absolutely without the epithet
<em>activa</em> or <em>passiva</em>, is liable to two
interpretations, and becomes a source
of mischievous equivocations. I do
not see what prevented our old Latin
philosophers from designating the
two kinds of <em>potentia</em> by two different
words. Had they constantly used
<em>virtus</em> or <em>vis</em> for the <i lang="la">potentia activa</i>,
and reserved <em>potentia</em> exclusively for
the <i lang="la">potentia passiva</i>, they would not
have mistaken the one for the other,
as they sometimes did. Let me
quote a few examples of this for our
common instruction.</p>

<p>Sanseverino, a very learned man,
and one of the best modern scholastics,
while arguing against the
Scotists, who deny all real distinction
between the soul and its faculties,
says that if the soul and its faculties
are really the same thing, then, "as
the soul is always in act, the faculties
also must be always in act and never
in potency." Whence he infers that
"the soul would have no potentiality,
and would therefore be a <i lang="la">purus actus</i>
like God"; which is, of course, a
pantheistic absurdity.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> But evidently
this inference has no other foundation
than the confusion of the <i lang="la">potentia
activa</i> with the <i lang="la">potentia passiva</i>.
The author, in fact, knows perfectly
well that no being in which there is
<i lang="la">potentia passiva</i> can be styled <i lang="la">purus
actus</i>: when, therefore, he draws the
conclusion that the soul, in the Scotistic
theory, would be <i lang="la">purus actus</i>,
he must be understood to mean or
imply that all <i lang="la">potentia passiva</i> would
be excluded from the soul. Yet his
premises are concerned with the
<i lang="la">potentia activa</i> only; and it is quite
evident, that from such premises he
could not have passed to such a
conclusion had he not confounded
the two kinds of <em>potentia</em> with one
another.</p>

<p>I would remark, also, that in his
argument the expression, "The faculties
must be always in act," cannot
mean that the faculties must be
always <em>acting</em>, but only that they are
always <em>actual</em>, as the soul itself; and,
therefore, the author cannot reasonably
conclude that the faculties
"would never be in potency" respecting
their proper acts. The <i lang="la">potentia
activa</i> is already an "act," as it is
known, since it is called <i lang="la">actus primus
agendi</i>; and is not called <em>potentia</em>,
except as contrasted with its accidental
operations. Moreover, a faculty
does not cease to be <i lang="la">potentia activa</i>,
even when it actually performs its
operations. When I actually make
a syllogism, my faculty of reasoning
is "in act," and yet it retains its <i lang="la">potentia
activa</i> with regard to any
number of other syllogisms. It is
not true, therefore, that a faculty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
which is in actual operation ceases
to be <i lang="la">in potentia activa</i>. Lastly, the
soul itself, which, as Sanseverino
remarks, is always in act, is nevertheless
always in potency also; for
the actuality of all contingent being
is always potential&mdash;that is, liable
to modifications of different kinds.
Hence, we not only deny the conclusion
of the learned author as illegitimate,
but affirm that the premises
themselves, on which he relies, are
untenable. It is the indiscriminate
use of the word <em>potentia</em> that vitiates
the author's argumentation.</p>

<p>Another great Thomist, Goudin,
wishing to prove that in all creatures
the power of acting is an accident,
argues that <i lang="la">potentia et actus sunt idem,
quamvis diversimode</i>, and that <i lang="la">actus
est semper nobilior quam potentia ad
eum essentialiter ordinata</i>; whence he
concludes that, if a given act is an
accident, the active power, whence
it proceeds, must needs be an accident
too. Here, also, the equivocation
is evident. The act is <i lang="la">nobilior
quam potentia</i> when we compare it
with the <i lang="la">potentia passiva</i> which is
destined to receive it&mdash;that is, to be
actuated by it&mdash;but when an act is
compared with the active power from
which it proceeds&mdash;that is, with the
<i lang="la">potentia activa</i>&mdash;we cannot say that it
is <i lang="la">nobilior quam potentia ad eum essentialiter
ordinata</i>: it is the contrary
that is true. Had the author used
the word <i lang="la">virtus agendi</i> instead of the
equivocal word <em>potentia</em>, he would
soon have discovered the fallacy of
his argument.</p>

<p>I am sorry to say that even S.
Thomas sometimes forgets to observe
the distinction between <i lang="la">potentia
activa</i> and <i lang="la">potentia passiva</i>; as in the
first part of his <cite>Summa</cite>, where he compares
the <i lang="la">potentia essendi</i> and the <i lang="la">potentia
operandi</i> with their respective
acts, and establishes a kind of proportion
between the two potencies
and the two acts.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> No such proportion
can be admitted, unless the <i lang="la">potentia
operandi</i> and the <i lang="la">potentia essendi</i>
are both similarly connected with
their acts. Yet whilst the <i lang="la">potentia
operandi</i> is active, the <i lang="la">potentia essendi</i>,
according to S. Thomas, is passive.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
They cannot, therefore, be related
to their acts in a similar manner.
Hence, the terms are not homologous,
and the proportion cannot subsist.
In another place, the holy doctor
argues that, if an act is accidental,
the <em>potentia</em> from which it proceeds
must be accidental also; because
<i lang="la">potentia et actus dividunt ens, et quodlibet
genus entis</i>, and, therefore, <i lang="la">oportet
quod ad idem genus referatur potentia
et actus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> But the <em>potentia</em> which,
with the <i lang="fr">actus</i>, constitutes the being
and every class of beings is the <i lang="la">potentia
passiva</i>; whilst the <em>potentia</em>
from which any act proceeds is the
<i lang="la">potentia activa</i>. The argument, therefore,
contains four terms, and proves
one thing only, namely, that it is
extremely difficult, even for the greatest
men, to avoid equivocations when
things that are different and opposite
are designated by the same term.</p>

<p>In English, the word <em>potentia</em> is
commonly represented by "power,"
to which the epithets of "active"
and "passive" have been attached
by some writers, in the same manner
as was done with the Latin <em>potentia</em>.
"Power," says Locke,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> "may be considered
twofold, namely, as able to
make or able to receive any change."
But "in strictness," says Webster,
"passive power is an absurdity in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>terms. To say that gold has a power
to be melted is improper language;
yet for want of a more appropriate
word, <em>power</em> is often used in a passive
sense."</p>

<p>It is not true, however, that "the
want of a more appropriate word"
really compels us to use the word
<em>power</em> in a passive sense. Have we
not the word <em>potency</em>? This word
exactly answers our purpose. It is
not only the exact equivalent of the
Latin <em>potentia</em>, but is also the immediate
relation of the terms <em>potential</em>,
<em>potentially</em>, <em>potentiality</em>, which are already
admitted in common philosophical
language as expressing capability,
passiveness, and liability.
These latter words are only subordinate
members of a family, of which
<em>potency</em> is the head. Therefore, to
convey the notion of <i lang="la">potentia passiva</i>,
we have a more appropriate word
than "power," and nothing compels
us to employ the absurd expression
of "passive power." On the other
hand, the remarks above made, on
the consequences of the promiscuous
use of the word <em>potentia</em> in the active
and the passive sense, would suffice
to show that the word "power," even
if it could be used without absurdity
in the passive sense, should, in philosophy,
be restricted to the active;
as it is most desirable that things
which are so thoroughly opposite
be expressed by different words.
Thus, the word "power" retaining its
active meaning, the <i lang="la">potentia passiva</i>
may very appropriately be styled
"potency."</p>

<p>Some will ask, Why should we use
the word "potency" in this new sense,
while we have already the term "potentiality,"
which seems to express
very exactly the same notion? I answer
that the principle of passivity,
which we call "potency," is an essential
constituent of created beings;
whilst "potentiality" is not an essential
constituent, but an attribute flowing
from the essential constitution of
being, on account of the potency
which the latter involves. Accordingly,
"potentiality" cannot stand
for "potency," any more than rationality
can stand for reason, or materiality
for matter.</p>

<p>From the foregoing considerations,
it appears that the words "act" and
"potency" cannot be easily dispensed
with in metaphysics, and, therefore,
should be freely admitted and acknowledged
as philosophical terms.
As to their definitions, however, we
shall have to rely on philosophical
treatises rather than on common English
dictionaries. The word "act"
is indeed to be found in all dictionaries;
but, unfortunately, its meaning is
restricted to the expression of mere
accidents, while substantial acts are
ignored altogether. In Fleming's
<cite>Vocabulary of Philosophy</cite> we find:
"Act in metaphysics and in logic is
opposed to power. Power is simply
a faculty or property of anything, as
gravity of bodies. <em>Act</em> is the exercise
or manifestation of a power or property,
the realization of a fact, as the
falling of a heavy body." On these
words I would incidentally remark
that "power" cannot be defined a
"faculty"; because, though all faculties
are powers, yet there are powers
which are not faculties. Again,
"power" cannot be defined a "property"
without adding some restriction;
as there are properties which
are not powers. Moreover, the "gravity
of bodies" is not a power, as
some unphilosophical scientists imagine,
but is a simple tendency to fall,
owing to the fact that the active power
of the earth is actually applied to
the passive potency of the body.
Nor is it true that in metaphysics or
in logic the <em>act</em> is the "exercise or
manifestation of a power." Such an
exercise and manifestation is <em>action</em>&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>that
is, the position or the production
of the act. As to "the falling of a
heavy body," it is true that we usually
call it <em>an act</em>, but we evidently
mean <em>actuality</em>; for, if the falling
were an act strictly, then the tendency
to fall would be an active power;
which it is not. Lastly, the most
important metaphysical meaning of
the word "act," and of its correlative,
"potency," is not given; which, however,
is not owing to any oversight
of the author, as we have already
said that these two words were not
used by English writers in this philosophical
sense.</p>

<p>In Worcester's and Webster's dictionaries,
the word <em>act</em> is said to
mean action, exertion of power, and
real existence as opposed to possibility.
From the preceding remarks, it
may be seen that, in metaphysics,
none of these three meanings can be
considered rigorously accurate.</p>

<p><em>Act</em>, in the scholastic language, is
that which gives existence by formal
actuation. <em>Potency</em> is that which, by
formal actuation, receives existence.
<em>Actuality</em> is the result of the actuation&mdash;that
is, the very existence of the act
in its potency. Actuality, as we have
already remarked, was also called
<i lang="la">actus existentiæ</i>; hence, existence
itself was considered as an act received
in the essence, and causing it
to be. But this view is now generally
abandoned, because it has been
shown that it is not the existence
that entails the reality of the act and
the potency, but the real position of
the act in its potency that entails the
existence of the being. Accordingly,
existence is not an act received in
the essence, but the result of the
position of the essence; and cannot
be called <em>an act</em>, except in a logical
sense, inasmuch as it gives to the
being <i lang="la">denominationem existentis</i>.</p>

<p>An act is called <em>essential</em> when it
gives the first existence to any essence,
be it simple or compound; <em>substantial</em>,
when it gives the first existence
to a pure potency; <em>accidental</em>, when
it gives a mode of being. The distinction
between essential and substantial
acts will be explained here below,
where we examine the different kinds
of forms.</p>

<p>Every being acts inasmuch as it
is in act, and is acted on inasmuch
as it is in potency. Hence, the
substantial act is a principle of activity,
and the potency a principle of
passivity.</p>

<p>The active power of any being, if
taken in the concrete, is nothing but
its substantial act <em>as ready for exertion</em>,
and is called active power,
because its exertion is the position or
the production of an act. The active
power thus considered is, therefore,
in reality one of the constituent
principles of natural beings; whilst
the abstract term <em>activity</em> does not
stand for a principle, but for an attribute
of the being&mdash;that is, for its
<em>readiness to act</em>.</p>

<p>The passive potency of any being,
if taken in the concrete, is nothing
but the term of the substantial act <em>as
liable to be acted on</em>, and is called
passive or receptive, because it is
actuated by the reception of an act.
The passive potency, thus considered,
is therefore in reality one of the
constituent principles of natural beings,
whilst the abstract term <em>passivity</em>
does not stand for a principle,
but for an attribute of the being&mdash;that
is, for its <em>liability to be acted on</em>.</p>

<p>Every one who is acquainted with
metaphysical matters will acknowledge
that it is of extreme importance
that these terms and others of a like
nature, which are continually employed
in metaphysical analysis, be clearly
understood by all students of
philosophy. So long as our language
has no definite words by which to
designate the essential constituents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
of things, no hope can be entertained
of advancing the interests of metaphysics
by means of vernacular books.</p>

<p><em>Act</em> and <em>potency</em>, in material things,
are called <em>form</em> and <em>matter</em> respectively;
hence, material substance is said
to consist essentially of matter and
form. The forms of natural things
are usually divided into <em>substantial</em>
and <em>accidental</em>. The substantial form
is commonly defined as that which
gives the first existence to its matter&mdash;<i lang="la">quæ
dat materiæ primum esse</i>, or
<i lang="la">simpliciter esse</i>. It is sometimes
defined, also, as that which gives the
first existence to a thing&mdash;<i lang="la">quæ dat
primum esse rei</i>. But this second
definition is open to misconstruction;
because, when the thing in question
is a physical compound having a
number of material parts, the form
that gives to it&mdash;that is, to the compound
essence&mdash;its first existence is
its physical composition, which is not
a substantial, but an essential, form,
as we shall see presently.</p>

<p>The accidental form is defined as
that which gives an accidental mode
of being&mdash;<i lang="la">quæ dat esse secundum quid</i>.
This definition is universally admitted;
but it is a remarkable fact that
the examples of accidental forms given
by most philosophers do not support
it. Thus, the form of a statue and
the form of a column are not forms
giving to the marble any accidental
mode of being, but are <em>the very modes
of being</em>, which have resulted in the
marble from the reception of suitable
accidental acts. Therefore, what is
called <em>the form</em> of a statue is not a
form <em>giving a mode of being</em>, but the
mode itself, on account of which <em>we
give</em> to the marble <em>the name</em> of a
statue. Suarez and others have indeed
pointed out the necessity of distinguishing
the forms <i lang="la">dantes esse</i> from
the forms <i lang="la">dantes denominationem</i>; yet,
even to this day, in our philosophical
treatises, the definition of the former
is almost exclusively illustrated by
examples of the latter. True forms
are <em>acts</em>, whilst modes of being are
<em>actualities</em>; and therefore modes of
being should not be called forms, but
formalities. As, however, the word
<em>form</em> is in general use in this last
sense also, the best thing we can do
is to retain the term, and add to it a
suitable epithet. I would call them
<em>resultant forms</em>, or <em>consequential forms</em>;
and in the same manner, when actuality
is styled <em>act</em>, I would call it <em>consequential
act</em>, or <em>complementary act</em>,
that it may not be confounded with
<em>act</em> proper.</p>

<p>It is also necessary to make a well-marked
distinction between <em>substantial</em>
and <em>essential</em> forms. The necessity
of this distinction is sufficiently
shown by the very existence of the two
scholastic definitions of form. In
fact, two definitions imply two concepts.
The first definition, <i lang="la">Forma est
id quod dat primum esse materiæ</i>,
strictly belongs to the substantial
form, as every one knows; but the
second, <i lang="la">Forma est id quod dat primum
esse rei</i>, is more general, and extends
to all essential forms, be they substantial
or not. Thus, we can say that
velocity is the essential form of movement,
though, of course, it is not a
substantial form, as movement is not a
substance.</p>

<p>The same distinction is to be admitted
with regard to natural compounds,
at least in the opinion of
those philosophers who oppose the
Aristotelic theory of substantial generations,
or teach that bodies are made
up of primitive, unextended elements.
Indeed, if chemical combination does
not destroy the essence of the combining
substances, it is obvious that
the compound substance which arises
out of the combination will have no
<em>special</em> form, except the combination
itself; and such a form, however essential
to the compound substance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
cannot be a substantial form in the
sense of the Peripatetics; because it
gives existence to the compound nature
only, and not to its matter.
Again, if the molecule of a primitive
body, as hydrogen, is nothing more
than a system of material points or
elements connected with one another
by dynamical ties, and subject to
a law of vibratory movement, which
allows the molecule to contract and
dilate, then it is evident that the
essential form of such a molecule will
be its specific composition; for the
composition is the immediate constituent
of all material compound. Accordingly,
since the scientific views
which lead to these conclusions are
widely received, and very well founded
on chemical and other data, and can
be philosophically established by the
very principles of ancient metaphysics,
the said distinction between substantial
and essential forms is to be
acknowledged as a very important
one in questions connected with modern
science. Lastly, essential forms
are to be admitted, not only in
natural, but also in artificial and in
moral, compounds. A clock has its
essential form, without which it would
cease to be a clock; a family has its
essential form, without which it would
cease to be a family; and yet it would
be ridiculous to talk of a clock or a
family as having a substantial form. It
is, therefore, necessary to divide all
true forms into <em>substantial</em>, <em>essential</em>,
and <em>accidental</em>, and to place in a separate
class all the so-called <em>resultant</em>
forms above mentioned.</p>

<p>Thus, the <em>substantial</em> form is that
which gives the first being to matter.
This definition comes from Aristotle
himself, and has been universally received
by all metaphysicians.</p>

<p>The <em>essential</em> form is that which
gives to a thing its specific nature.
This definition coincides with that of
the substantial form whenever the
specific nature of which we treat is
physically simple&mdash;that is, without
composition of material parts&mdash;for, in
fact, such a simple nature receives its
species from the same form that gives
the first being to its matter. Hence,
the essential form and the substantial
form are one and the same thing so
long as there is question of simple or
primitive beings. But the definition
of the essential form is no longer
equivalent to that of the substantial
form when the specific nature
constituted by it is physically compounded
of material parts; because
such a compound nature receives its
species from its specific composition,
which is not a substantial form,
though it is essential to the specific
compound.</p>

<p>The <em>accidental</em> form is that which
gives to its subject an accidental
mode of being, or an <i lang="la">esse secundum
quid</i>, according to the language of the
schools.</p>

<p>The so-called <em>resultant</em> form is the
actuality resulting from the position
of any true form. As, therefore, true
forms are either substantial, essential,
or accidental, so, also, are all the
resultant forms. From the substantial
form results the actuality of the
primitive being, which, as primitive,
is always free from material composition;
from the essential form results
the actuality of every specific nature,
which involves composition of material
parts; and from the accidental
form results the actual modification
of the subject in which it is received.</p>

<p>I have dwelt purposely on these
considerations, because the word
<em>form</em>, and its derivatives, <em>formal</em>, <em>formally</em>,
<em>formality</em>, etc., are variously
employed, and sometimes loosely, in
philosophy, and because, without a
clear and distinct notion of the different
kinds of forms, many fundamental
questions of metaphysics cannot
be rightly understood. I might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
say nearly as much respecting the
word <em>matter</em>, which is the metaphysical
correlative of form; but it will
suffice to remark that <em>matter</em>, in philosophy,
always means a receptive potency
which is actuated by a form;
so that, if the form is accidental, the
word <em>matter</em> stands for material substance
itself as receptive, because it is
the substance that receives accidental
forms; if the form is essential in the
sense above explained, then the word
<em>matter</em> means the totality of the material
parts required for the constitution
of any given specific compound, including
their actual disposition to receive
the form in question; and if
the form is substantial, then the word
<em>matter</em> expresses only one of the constituent
principles of primitive material
substance&mdash;that is, the potential
term of substance; which is first actuated
by such a form.</p>

<p>The word <em>matter</em> is used analogically
in many other senses, which are
given by our lexicographers, who,
however, omit to mention matter as
that potency which receives its first existence
through the substantial form.
Webster says: "Matter is usually divided
by philosophical writers into
three kinds or classes: solid, liquid,
and aeriform." This statement is not
correct. Philosophical writers admit
that <em>bodies</em> are either solid, liquid, or
aeriform; but they do not admit that
the matter of which bodies and their
molecules are made up is either
solid, or liquid, or aeriform. Ice is
solid, water is liquid, and vapor is
aeriform; and yet the matter in all of
them is identically the same. It is
impossible, therefore, for philosophical
writers to divide <em>matter</em> into
liquid, solid, and aeriform. The
philosophical division of matter has
always been into <i lang="la">materia informis</i>,
or <i lang="la">prima</i>, or <em>actuabilis</em>&mdash;that is, matter
conceived as void of all substantial
form; and <i lang="la">materia formata</i>, or <em>secunda</em>,
or <em>actuata</em>&mdash;that is, matter actuated
by, and existing under, a substantial
form.</p>

<p>As I am not now writing a treatise
on matter, I will dismiss this subject
with only two observations. The
first is, that the words <em>first matter</em>
and <em>second matter</em> are indispensable
in metaphysics, and, therefore, must
be adopted in our English philosophical
language, unless, indeed,
we prefer to make use of the original
Latin words. The other is, that in
reading the metaphysical works of
the scholastics, when we find the
word <i lang="la">materia</i> with the epithet <i lang="la">prima</i>,
we should carefully ascertain that the
epithet is not misapplied. For, it
has been observed with reason that
most of the abstruseness and uncertainty
inherent in the old explanation
of physical questions arises from
the fact that the matter, which was
supposed to be actually under its
form, and therefore in act, was very
frequently called <i lang="la">materia prima</i>,
though it is known that "nothing
that is in act can be called by such a
name."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> This observation is of the
greatest importance, since it is evident
that nothing but perpetual confusion
can arise from contradictory
definitions.</p>

<p>To express the relation existing
between act and potency, or between
form and matter, the philosophical
Latin possesses many good phrases,
such as the following: <i lang="la">Forma dat
esse materiæ, actuat materiam, informat
materiam, terminatur ad materiam</i>;
and, reciprocally, <i lang="la">materia accipit
esse a forma, actuatur a forma, informatur
a forma, terminat formam</i>.
In English, I presume, we are allow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>ed
to say that the form <em>informs</em> its
matter, that the form <em>gives existence</em>
to the matter, and that the
form <em>actuates</em> the matter. But
can we say that the form <em>is terminated
to</em> its matter, and that the
matter <em>terminates</em>, that is, completes
its form? This manner of speaking
may be considered awkward, nevertheless
its mode of expressing the relation
of the form to its matter is so
remarkable for its philosophical precision,
clearness, and universality,
that I would not hesitate to adopt it
in philosophy. To say that the form
is terminated to its matter, is to say
that the matter is the potential <em>term</em>
actuated by the form. The philosophical
notion of <em>term</em> (<em>terminus</em>),
which is susceptible of a general application
to all conceivable beings,
is a very important one in philosophy
as well as in theology; and since it
can be made quite intelligible even
to the dullest of students, I think
that in metaphysical speculation the
use of the words <em>term</em>, <em>termination</em>,
<em>to terminate</em>, <em>terminability</em>, <em>terminativity</em>,
etc., cannot but greatly help
both teachers and students in their
efforts to explain correctly a number
of ontological relations which it
would be difficult to express as simply
and as correctly by other words.</p>

<p>The word <em>term</em> in the popular use
means the extremity of anything, or
that where anything ends. The
spot of ground where a stone is allowed
to fall is the term of the falling;
the drop of rain acted on by
gravity is the term of the action by
which it is attracted; the tree at
which I am looking is the term of
my vision; the concept which I form
of anything is the term of my thought.
But all these terms correspond to accidental
acts, whereas the term which
we ultimately reach in the analysis
of substance, is always substantial, as
being intrinsic to the substantial act
of which it is the term. Hence,
when we say that the matter is the
term of the form, or in general that
the potency is the term of its act,
we mean not only that the act, or
the form, reaches the potency or the
matter, but that the potency or the
matter acquires its first reality and
actuality by the very position of the
act or form which it terminates; in
the same manner as the centre of a
sphere acquires its first actuality
through the simple position of a
spherical form. Accordingly, the
words <em>act</em> and <em>term</em> are correlative;
the act <em>actuates</em>, the term <em>is actuated</em>,
and the formal reason of their correlation
is <em>actuation</em>. This actuation
is not efficient, but formal; that is,
the act, not by its action, but by
itself, entails the immediate existence
of its intrinsic term, just as the spherical
form by itself, and not by any action,
entails the immediate existence
of a centre. As a sphere without a
centre, so an act without a term is
an utter impossibility. Hence the
termination of the act to its term is
nothing less than the very constitution
of any essence that has a proper
and complete existence. For this
reason, I am of opinion that the
phrase "the form is terminated to
the matter, and the act to its potency,"
is the best we can adopt in
speaking of created things, however
new it may be to English ears.</p>

<p>With regard to the peculiar construction
of this verb with the preposition
<em>to</em> instead of the prepositions
<em>by</em>, <em>at</em>, or <em>in</em>, which are in general
use, I will only remark that these
latter prepositions are not suitable
to express what we need. The <em>termination
at</em> connotes a limit of time
or space, as every one knows. The
<em>termination in</em> connotes a change or
successive transformation of that
which is terminated into that in
which it ends, as when a quarrel ter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>minates
in murder. The <em>termination
by</em> connotes either an obstacle to further
advance, or at least a positive
entity existing independently of the
termination itself: it cannot therefore
express the fact that a substantial
term receives its very first actuality
by the termination of the act. On
the other hand, this fact is perfectly
expressed by saying that the act is
terminated <em>to</em> its term; and since no
other English phrase has yet been
found, so far as I know, which can
express the fact equally well, I think
that we need have no scruple in enriching
our philosophical language
with this old scholastic phrase.</p>

<p>"The resources of our noble language
in philosophy," says a well-known
American writer, "are surpassed
by no ancient or modern
tongue, unless the Greek be an exception.
It is capable in philosophy
of receiving and assimilating all the
riches of the Greek, Latin, Italian,
and French languages, while it has
in its Teutonic roots the wealth of
the German."<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> This is a great encouragement
to English philosophical
writers. Indeed, to say that
among the resources of the English
language for philosophy we may
reckon its capability of receiving and
assimilating all the riches of other
learned languages, is to tell us that
our resources are still in a <em>potential</em>
state, and therefore that no one can
reasonably blame us for freely adopting
from other languages as many
terms and phrases as we need to express
our thoughts with philosophical
rigor. Yet the task, for obvious
reasons, is extremely difficult, as it
requires a degree of judgment which
unfortunately is common only to the
few. "The English language," adds
the same writer, "only needs Catholic
restoration and culture to be the
richest and noblest language ever
written or spoken. But it deteriorates,
as does everything else, in the
hands of Protestants and unbelieving
Englishmen and Americans." At
least two things are certain; first,
that if the English language ever becomes
a perfect instrument of philosophical
education, it will be due
to Catholic writers, for they alone
will be able to utilize for its
healthy development all the treasures
of the scholastic terminology;
second, that only in proportion as
such a development will be carried
on, shall we acquire the means of
training our youthful generation in
a vernacular course of philosophy.
This thought should rouse our dormant
energies into action. It was
with this object that I undertook to
say a few words on philosophical terminology.
Our language may be
capable of receiving and assimilating
all the riches of other languages; but
so long as such an assimilation is in
abeyance, the language remains poor
and imperfect, nay, it continues to
"deteriorate, as does everything else,
in the hands of Protestants and unbelieving
Englishmen and Americans."
We still need many philosophical
words. I have given a few
examples of such a need in the preceding
pages.</p>

<p>That we also need a number of
new phrases is undeniable; but I will
not enter into the discussion of so
difficult a subject. I prefer simply
to mention a few Latin phrases, which
are much used by Catholic philosophers
or theologians, and will allow
the reader himself to attempt their
translation without altering their philosophical
meaning, and without infringing
upon English usages. Translate:</p>

<p><i lang="la">Actus et potentia conspirant in unitatem
essentiæ.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p><i lang="la">Actio motiva terminatur materialiter
ad mobile, et formaliter ad motum.</i></p>

<p><i lang="la">Sicut se habet actus substantialis ad
esse simpliciter, ita se habet actus accidentalis
ad esse secundum quid.</i></p>

<p><i lang="la">Facultas ordinatur ad operationem
ut actus primus ad secundum.</i></p>

<p><i lang="la">Quidquid sistit in suis essentialibus,
nullo superaddito, est unum per se.</i></p>

<p><i lang="la">Intellectus attingit objectum sub ratione
veri, voluntas autem sub ratione
boni.</i></p>

<p><i lang="la">Actus et potentia principiant ens
principiatione metaphysica.</i></p>

<p><i lang="la">Relatio est id cuius totum esse est ad
aliud se habere.</i></p>

<p><i lang="la">Motus est actus existentis in potentia
ut in potentia.</i></p>

<p>These and such like phrases will
afford matter for a great exercise of
patience to him who will undertake
to translate them faithfully. <em>To conspire
into unity, to be terminated to a
movable object, to be ordered to the operation</em>,
<em>etc.</em>, are scarcely good English
expressions: yet it is not easy to see
what other phrases would be calculated
to express the same thoughts in
an unobjectionable manner.</p>

<p>I will conclude by giving the opinion
of a competent authority on this
very point. The Rev. F. Hill, in the
preface to his substantial work lately
published under the title of <cite>Elements
of Philosophy</cite>, says: "The Latin of
the schools, besides being brief, is
also peculiarly capable of expressing
precisely, clearly, and comprehensively
matters which it is difficult to
utter through the less accurate vernacular
in terms that are neither obscure
nor ambiguous." And speaking
of the Latin philosophical axioms
and sentences, which he inserted in
his treatise with their English translation,
he remarks: "It was not,
however, an easy task, in some instances,
to reproduce them with
fidelity in the English phraseology,
as the classic scholar will readily see
from the result." Certainly, the task
was not an easy one. Yet the author
has most creditably carried out his
object. May his example encourage
others to cultivate the same field,
and thus contribute towards developing
"the resources of our noble language,"
and making it a fit channel
for sound philosophical education.</p>

<p>"Fais ce que dois, advienne que pourra!"</p></div>

<p>Louis was thunderstruck at seeing
Madeleine. He had not spoken
a word to her for several days, and
intended to maintain a reserve full
of circumspection towards her. His
connection with the family had twice
given rise to the most malevolent
interpretations, and he by no means
wished a similar vexation to be repeated.
He received the young girl
with a coldness that was almost rude.</p>

<p>"What do you wish?" said he.</p>

<p>"To speak with you, monsieur.
But I fear I have come at the wrong
time. I will return at a later hour."</p>

<p>"Not later, but elsewhere."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Madeleine, with
<i lang="fr">naïveté</i>.</p>

<p>"But what have you so urgent to
tell me?..."</p>

<p>"Nothing concerning you, monsieur;
it only relates to myself. I
am so unhappy.... If I ventured
to come here at this hour, it is because
I feared being seen talking
with you. I have a secret to confide
to you which my parents alone
are aware of. If they knew I told
you, I do not know what they would
do to me."</p>

<p>"Where are your parents now?"</p>

<p>"At my cousin's, a league off.
They will not be back for several
hours."</p>

<p>Madeleine was so overwhelmed
with grief and anxiety that Louis was
filled with compassion. He motioned
for her to be seated on a lounge before
his desk, and then said:</p>

<p>"Well, my good Madeleine, what
has happened? Tell me your troubles.
If in my power to remove
them, it shall soon be done. What
can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"You know Durand, the overseer?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!..." said Louis,
frowning with the air of a man who
knows more than he expresses.</p>

<p>"He and my father have become
intimate, I know not how or why,
within a few weeks&mdash;since you
stopped coming to our house. He
often came before the inundation,
and paid me a thousand absurd compliments.
I made no reply to his
silly speeches, but they seemed to
please my parents. The first moment
I set eyes on that man, he inspired
me with fear. He looks so bold&mdash;so
false! And besides...."</p>

<p>"Besides what? Madeleine, I
insist on your telling me everything."</p>

<p>"Well, he tried every way to make
us believe you are.... I dare not
tell you...."</p>

<p>"Go on, child. Nothing would
astonish me from Durand. I know
he hates me."</p>

<p>"He says you are a hypocrite,
a&mdash;Jesuit, a dangerous man. He
told my father you were going to
leave the mill, and seemed to boast
of being the cause of it."</p>

<p>"I suspected it," said Louis to
himself. "Adams was only Durand's
tool. Oh! what deceit!"</p>

<p>"Is it true, then, that you are going
away?" asked Madeleine anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>"Quite true, my child."</p>

<p>"Oh! what a hateful man! I
was right in detesting him! Since
we have been here living in the
same house with him, he has tormented
me more than ever. He
says he wishes to marry me...."</p>

<p>"Has he dared go that far?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and, what is worse, my parents
have given their consent. Durand
tells them he has money laid
up; that he is earning a good deal
here, and is willing to live with them
and provide for the support of the
whole family.... But I&mdash;I have a
horror of that man! There is nothing
disagreeable I do not say to him. I
have told him plainly I would never
consent to marry him. My parents
were terribly angry at this; my father
beat me, and my mother loaded me
with abuse. They ended by saying,
if I persisted in refusing Durand,
they would find a way of making me
change my mind. This scene took
place last evening. What shall I
do? O God! what shall I do?..."
So saying, Madeleine burst into
tears.</p>

<p>Louis remained silent. He was
reflecting. Self whispered: "Leave
this girl to her unhappy fate. Do not
embark in another undertaking that
will get you into fresh trouble and
may endanger everything&mdash;both Eugénie's
love for you, and your reputation
itself. This unfortunate girl
has already been the cause of more
than one sad moment; take care she
does not at last ruin you, and likewise
compromise herself...."</p>

<p>But such selfish promptings had no
power over a heart so generous and
upright as that of Louis. Besides,
he had learned such shocking things
about Durand that, if he did not reveal
them in order to save Madeleine,
he would regard himself guilty of a
crime, and not without reason. After
some moments of silent reflection, all
incertitude ceased. He had decided
on the course to pursue.</p>

<p>"How old are you, my child?"
said he.</p>

<p>"I am in my twenty-first year."</p>

<p>"Well, you have hitherto devoted
yourself generously to the interests
of your parents. They have now
made this impossible. There is no
choice in the matter. You must leave
them."</p>

<p>"I have thought of it. But where
could I go? I have no place of
refuge, now my aunt is dead."</p>

<p>"I will give you a note to a lady
who lives in the city. I may as well
say at once it is my sister. She will
take care of you, and get you a place
as a chamber-maid, if she does not
keep you herself."</p>

<p>"Oh! how kind you are!...
You revive my courage. When can
I go?"</p>

<p>"When you please."</p>

<p>"To-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"And who will inform my parents?"</p>

<p>"You yourself. Write a line, and
leave it with some one you can trust,
to be delivered a few hours after you
are gone. You can tell your parents
you are going to seek a situation in
the city in order to escape from
Durand. Promise to be a credit to
them, to love them always, and even
to render them assistance; and I
will say more to them when the proper
time comes. Above all, I will
tell them what Durand really is....
Thank God, my child, that he enables
you to escape that man's
snares...."</p>

<p>Everything was done as agreed
upon by Louis and Madeleine. The
latter left for town the next morning.
Her parents were not informed of
her departure till about noon. They
immediately notified Durand.</p>

<p>"The engineer has had a hand in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
this," said he to Vinceneau and his
wife. "He shall pay for it."</p>

<p>"What makes you think he had
anything to do with it?" asked Vinceneau.</p>

<p>"Your daughter went to see him
last evening.... My police told
me."</p>

<p>"How shall we be revenged?"</p>

<p>"By telling everybody what this
Tartuffe is. I will see to it. Ah!
he induces young girls to run away
without any one's knowing where
they are gone! That is rather too
bold!"</p>

<p>Durand watched for an opportunity
of speaking to Albert, with
whom he kept up daily communication.
He told him what had occurred,
adding calumnious suppositions
that may be imagined. Albert, delighted
at the news, went at once to
tell his aunt. It was near dinnertime.
Mme. Smithson said to her
nephew: "Wait till we are at table,
then relate this story without appearing
to attach any importance to it.
If I am not very much mistaken, this
will be a death-blow to that troublesome
creature. Only be prudent, and
do not begin till I make a sign. There
are times when your uncle takes no
interest in the conversation, no matter
what is said. Poor Eugénie will
blush well to hear of such infamous
conduct, for she loves him. It is horrible
to say, but so it is. Since I
caught them talking together the
other day, I have had no doubt
about it. Besides, as you have remarked,
she grows more and more
reserved toward us, while, on the
contrary, she has redoubled her amiability
towards her father. I really
believe, if the foolish fellow had not
compromised himself, she would in
the end have got the better of us. Her
father is so indulgent to her!...
But after what has taken place, there
can be no more illusion! She will
perceive the worth of her hero!...
It must be acknowledged there is no
alternative! Her romance has ended
in a way to make her ashamed of
it for ever.... You will see, Albert,
she will end by thinking it too great
an honor to be your wife."</p>

<p>"Too great an honor! Hum!
hum! It will be well if she consents.
Eugénie has more pride than any
girl I ever saw. Humbled, she will
be unapproachable. Believe me,
aunt, we must be cautious in availing
ourselves of this advantage."</p>

<p>They took seats at table at six
o'clock as usual. Mr. Smithson appeared
thoughtful and out of humor,
but that often happened. Eugénie
was no less serious. Very little was
said till the dessert. Albert evidently
longed to let fly the shaft he held
in reserve against Louis. Mme.
Smithson was quite as impatient as
he, but could not find a propitious
opportunity. However, her bitterness
against Louis prevailed. Towards
the end of dinner, she made
Albert an imperceptible sign, as much
as to say: "Proceed, but be prudent!"</p>

<p>Albert assumed as indifferent an
air as possible, and in an off-hand
way began his attack after this manner:</p>

<p>"There is trouble in the refugees'
quarter to-day."</p>

<p>Mme. Smithson looked up with an
air of surprise at the news. Mr.
Smithson and Eugénie remained impassible.</p>

<p>"The Vinceneaus are in great commotion,"
continued Albert. "Their
daughter has run away."</p>

<p>"A poor set&mdash;those Vinceneaus,"
muttered Mr. Smithson.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Albert, "a poor
set indeed! But this time I pity
them. Their daughter has gone off,
and no one knows where she has
gone."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why did she leave them?" asked
Eugénie.</p>

<p>"She and her parents had a violent
quarrel day before yesterday,
but not the first; they say this
Madeleine is more amiable in appearance
than in reality. Anyhow,
there is something inexplicable about
her. It seems she was to have been
married; then she refused to be. Result:
anger of the parents, obstinacy
of the daughter. All that is known
besides this is that she went all
alone to consult the engineer last
evening. Durand and another workman
saw her go to his room. This
morning she disappeared, leaving
word she intended to get a situation,
no one knows where; she has not
thought it proper to leave her address...."</p>

<p>While listening to this account,
Eugénie turned pale, then red, and
finally almost fainted. Mr. Smithson
perceived the sad effect of the
story on her, and was filled with inexpressible
sorrow. Heretofore he
had refused to believe in the possibility
of her loving Louis; but now
he could no longer doubt it. For
the first time in his life, he acknowledged
his wife had shown more
penetration than he&mdash;more prudence.
The look that rested on Eugénie
was not of anger, however, but full
of affection and anxiety. He loved
her too much not to pity her, even
though he blamed her.</p>

<p>Eugénie, with characteristic energy,
recovered her self-possession in
a few moments. Suspicions of a
stronger and more painful character
than any she had yet had struggled
with the love in this proud girl's
heart.</p>

<p>Albert was overjoyed, but concealed
his satisfaction under a hypocritical
air of compassion. Continuing
the subject, he said the workmen
were all indignant at Madeleine's
flight. "The engineer has done
well not to show himself since the
girl's departure was known," he added.
"He would have exposed himself
to a public manifestation of rather
a disagreeable nature. And I do not
see who could defend him...."</p>

<p>"He could defend himself, if he is
innocent," thought Eugénie....
Then another idea occurred to her:
"But if he has plans he cannot yet acknowledge, ...
if he loves this Madeleine, ...
ah! how he will have
deceived me!... No! it is impossible!...
And yet it is true he has
disappeared: I have not seen him
to-day...."</p>

<p>By an unfortunate coincidence,
Louis had been obliged to come to
see me that day. I had been taken
with a terrible pain in all my limbs&mdash;the
first symptoms of my paralytic
seizure. My mother, frightened beyond
all expression, sent a messenger
to our poor friend, conjuring him to
come with all possible speed.</p>

<p>"Enough!" said Mr. Smithson.
"The subject does not please me.
I do not like to be deceived, as I
have so often been before. It seems
to me there is some mistake here. I
shall ascertain the truth. But this
shall be my care. Let it be understood
that no one but myself is to
make any inquiries about the affair.
No tittle-tattle!"</p>

<p>They retired to the <i lang="fr">salon</i> a few
moments after. Albert offered Eugénie
his arm. She refused it, as if
to show him, if Louis were driven
from her heart, he, Albert, should
never have a place there. She seated
herself at the piano, and played a
succession of pieces with great effect.
Her ardent nature required the relief
of some outward manifestation. For
the first time in her life, she blushed
before her parents&mdash;before the cousin
she despised. But the torture she
suffered from her wounded pride was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
not the most painful. She had loved
Louis&mdash;she loved him still, as a woman
of her intelligence and energy
alone could love&mdash;that is to say, to
excess. And now she is forced to
ask herself: is an affection so pure met
only with hypocrisy, or at least an
indifference but too easy to understand.
Swayed between love and
contempt; by turns ashamed of herself,
then drawing herself up with
pride, she would have given ten years
of her life to be able at once to solve
the doubt that caused her so much
suffering.</p>

<p>While the poor girl was thus abandoning
herself to the most distressing
anxiety, without any consolation,
Mme. Smithson and Albert were
talking in a low tone near the fireplace.
They appeared dissatisfied.</p>

<p>"The affair has begun badly," said
Albert. "One would think my uncle
resolved to thwart me in everything....
Why could he not intimate to
that fellow that there is no necessity of
his remaining any longer?... That
is what I hoped and what I expected!
He has certainly done enough
to deserve being treated in such a
way.... Instead of that, my uncle is
going to undertake an investigation!...
I wager this arrant piece of craft
will find some way of making himself
out innocent."</p>

<p>"That would be rather too much!"
said Mme. Smithson. "You are
right: we must despatch business,
or all is lost. I will talk to your
uncle this very evening, and make
every effort to prevent their meeting...."</p>


<h4>CHAPTER XXVII.<br />

A VILLAIN'S REVENGE.</h4>

<p>The whole family were still in the
<i lang="fr">salon</i>, when, about half-past eight,
they heard an unusual noise out of
doors, and people seemed to be
moving about in the darkness. In a
few moments, a servant entered and
said a few words to Mr. Smithson in
a low tone. He immediately rose
and started to go out; but, before
leaving the room, he said: "I shall
not be gone long. I wish you all
to remain here till my return."</p>

<p>Eugénie continued to drum furiously
on the piano; then, weary of
this monotonous employment, she
took a book, and pretended to read.
Mme. Smithson and Albert were far
from being at ease. Triumphant as
they were, they stood in awe of Eugénie.
To keep themselves in countenance,
they began a game of cards.</p>

<p>What was Mr. Smithson doing
meanwhile? He forbade his servants
mentioning a word of what
had happened, which they were
aware of as well as he. Sure of
being obeyed, he went directly to
Louis' apartment. Entering the
room, he found him lying all dressed
on his bed, groaning and unable to
utter a word. A bloody handkerchief
was tied across his forehead, as
if he had received a severe wound.
At a sign from Mr. Smithson, the
servant dismissed all the men&mdash;hands
at the mill&mdash;who had brought the
engineer to his room. When they
were gone, the servant removed
the handkerchief that concealed the
wound. It was a long gash, which
was still bleeding. Louis opened
his eyes, and put his hand to his
neck, as if there was another wound
there. The servant untied his cravat.
The unfortunate young man's
neck, in fact, bore marks of violence.</p>

<p>The servant seemed greatly affected
at the sight. He placed the
wounded man in as comfortable a
position as he could, bandaged his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
wounds, and tried to revive him with
<em>eau-de-Cologne</em>. Louis came to himself
a little, and, extending his hand,
pressed that of the good fellow who
was tending him so kindly. Mr.
Smithson stood a few steps from the
bed, looking on as calmly as if gazing
at some unreal spectacle in a
theatre. No one would have divined
his thoughts from the expression of
his countenance; but at the bottom
of his heart there was a feeling of animosity
against Louis, which was
scarcely lessened by the sight of his
sufferings. At that moment, he believed
Louis guilty, and what had
happened only a chastisement he
merited. Nevertheless, he sent in
haste for a physician, who arrived in
a short time. Louis' clothes were
removed, and his wounds dressed
with the greatest care. The relief he
experienced, the warmth of the bed,
and the skill of the attentive physician,
produced a speedy and favorable
reaction. He recovered the
perfect use of speech, and, addressing
those around him with an attempt
at a smile, he said:</p>

<p>"They have brought me to a sad
condition."</p>

<p>"You will get over it," replied the
doctor.</p>

<p>"How did it happen?" asked Mr.
Smithson coldly.</p>

<p>"It is a long story to tell," replied
Louis. "I have not recovered
from the violent concussion, and am
still in severe pain; but I will endeavor
to tell you how it happened.
It is time for you to know the truth
about many things, Mr. Smithson.
What is your opinion of Durand?"</p>

<p>"He is a capable hand, but somewhat
unaccountable."</p>

<p>"Well, I have found him out....
He is a dangerous man. The condition
you see me in is owing to him."</p>

<p>"What induced him to ill-treat
you in this way?"</p>

<p>"He has hated me for a long
time, though secretly. Before I
came here, he did somewhat as he
pleased, and was guilty of many
base acts. He robbed you in many
ways&mdash;saying he had paid the workmen
money that was never given
them, and having an understanding
with one and another, in order to
cheat you. I found out his dishonest
trafficking, and put a stop to it.
This was the origin of his dislike."</p>

<p>"Why did you not notify me at
once?"</p>

<p>"My silence proceeded from motives
of delicacy. You will recollect
the man came here with excellent
recommendations; he was a Protestant;
and you liked him, and
thought more of him than of many
others."</p>

<p>"That is true. Go on."</p>

<p>"I afterwards discovered he lent
money on security. My reproaches
offended him still more. Within a
short time, he has become intimate
with that drunken Vinceneau and his
indolent wife, and, since the inundation
drove them here for shelter, he
has permanently installed himself in
their house. He only did this to
annoy their poor daughter, Madeleine,
with his audacious attentions.
The girl was indignant. Young as
she is, she felt there was something
vile&mdash;I may say criminal&mdash;in the
depths of his deceitful soul. But her
father and mother countenanced him.
They hoped a son-in-law so much
richer than they would enable them
to give themselves up to their shameful
inclinations&mdash;the husband to drink,
and the wife to idleness. Madeleine
was, therefore, ordered&mdash;and in such
a way!&mdash;to accept Durand's offer.
She came to consult me on the subject,
and said the man inspired her
with invincible horror. On the other
hand, her parents threatened her with
the worst treatment possible if she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
resisted their orders&mdash;a treatment already
begun. Now, I had learned
only a few days previous the following
particulars respecting Durand:
His name is not Durand, but Renaud.
He is not a Protestant, but a Catholic,
if such a man can be said to have
any religion. His fine recommendations
did not come from his employers;
he wrote them himself. He is
not a bachelor, but is married, and
the father of three children. Be good
enough to open my desk, Mr. Smithson....
You will find a letter from
Durand's wife, in which all these
facts are stated with a minuteness of
detail, and such an accent of truth,
that there can be no doubt after
reading it. It was addressed to the
<i lang="fr">curé</i>, begging him to threaten Durand&mdash;or
rather, Renaud&mdash;with the
law if he did not send for his wife
and children. They are dying of
want at Lille, whence he fled without
saying anything to them. They lost
all trace of him for a year, and only
heard of him again about six months
ago."</p>

<p>Mr. Smithson opened Louis' desk,
and took out the letter. The details
it contained were, in truth, so numerous
and so precise that there could
be no doubt they really referred to the
so-called Durand.</p>

<p>"What an infamous impostor!"
exclaimed he, as he finished the letter.
"Continue your account, monsieur.
I am eager to know how this
sad affair terminated."</p>

<p>"My friend, Mme. Barnier," continued
Louis, "has not been able to
leave St. Denis, where she took refuge
at the time of the inundation.
A violent affection of the muscular
system obliges her to keep her bed.
I learned this morning from a letter
that she was worse, and wished to
see me immediately. I went to St.
Denis. On my way back this evening
on foot, I met Durand not three hundred
steps from the mill. I cannot
say he was waiting for me, but am
inclined to think so. When he perceived
me by the light of the moon,
a gleam of fury lighted up his features.
I had no weapon of defence.
He, as usual, carried a strong, knotty
cane in his hand.</p>

<p>"'Where is Madeleine?' said he.</p>

<p>"'At my sister's,' I replied. In
fact, I had sent her there with a letter
of recommendation.</p>

<p>"'Why did you send her away?'</p>

<p>"'Because I wished to withdraw
her from your criminal pursuit.'</p>

<p>"'Criminal?... How was my
pursuit criminal? I wished to marry
her.'</p>

<p>"'You have not the right.'</p>

<p>"'What do you say? I haven't a
right to marry?'</p>

<p>"'No, you have not. You are
married already.'</p>

<p>"'It is false.'</p>

<p>"'I have the proof in my possession&mdash;a
letter from your wife.'
Then I told him what I knew of his
history, and ended thus: 'You have
hitherto gone from one crime to
another. It is time for you to reform.
Promise to begin a new life, and I
pledge my word to keep what I know
to myself.'</p>

<p>"'I promise&mdash;humble myself&mdash;and
to you!... There is one man too
many in the world, you or I. By
heaven! this must be ended.'</p>

<p>"I heard no more. Before I
could ward off the blow, he hit me,
causing the wound you see on my
head. Then he continued striking
me with diabolical fury. I could not
defend myself, but called for help.
Two men heard me in the mill, and
came running with all their might.
As soon as Durand saw them, he fled
I know not where. I beg he may
not be pursued; the crime is too serious."</p>

<p>Louis had ended his account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>"Monsieur," said Mr. Smithson,
"you have been strangely unfortunate
since you came here. It has all
arisen from a misunderstanding. I
distrusted you. I was wrong. You
have a noble heart. I see it now.
What you have said explains many
things I did not understand. You
have been odiously calumniated,
monsieur! Now that we have come
to an understanding, promise not to
leave me. I will go further: forgive
me."</p>

<p>Louis was affected to tears, and
could not reply.</p>

<p>"And now, monsieur," said Mr.
Smithson, "can I render you any
service?"</p>

<p>"I wish my father and sister to be
cautiously informed of what has happened
to me."</p>

<p>"I will go myself," said Mr. Smithson,
"and give them an account
of your unfortunate adventure. You
may rely on my making the communication
with all the discretion you
could wish. Will to-morrow be soon
enough?"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes. To go this evening
would made them think me in great
danger."</p>

<p>They continued to converse some
minutes longer, then Mr. Smithson
returned to the house. When he entered
the <i lang="fr">salon</i>, he found the family
exceedingly anxious. They suspected
something serious had occurred,
but the servants had not dared communicate
the slightest particular. Mr.
Smithson had forbidden it, and in his
house every one obeyed to the letter.</p>

<p>"M. Louis, ..." began he. At
this name, Eugénie turned pale. She
still loved the engineer, and waited
with dread for her father to allay the
suspicions so hateful to her, or to
confirm them.</p>

<p>"M. Louis came near being killed.
He was only wounded, and will soon
be well again."</p>

<p>"What happened to him?" cried
Eugénie eagerly.</p>

<p>Mme. Smithson and Albert exchanged
a look of intelligence. Mr.
Smithson related the facts he had
just learned from Louis. In proportion
as he unveiled the infamy of
Durand's conduct, and revealed the
nobility of Louis' nature, an expression
of joy, mingled with pride, dawned
on Eugénie's face. It was easy to
read the look she gave her mother
and Albert&mdash;a look of mingled happiness
and triumph which seemed to
say: "He is innocent; it is my turn
to rejoice!" Mr. Smithson, always
sincere and ready to acknowledge an
error, ended his account by expressing
his regret at having been hard,
suspicious, and unjust towards Louis.
"I shall henceforth regard him with
the highest respect; and I hope, if any
of you, like me, have been deceived
about him, that my words and example
will suffice to correct your mistake."</p>

<p>Mme. Smithson and Albert pretended
not to hear his last words;
but they struck Eugénie particularly.
Had she dared, she would have
thrown her arms around her father's
neck, and given vent to her joy and
gratitude. She was obliged to refrain,
but her sentiments were so legible
in her face that no one could
mistake them. You will not be surprised
to hear that Mme. Smithson
and her nephew cut a sad figure.</p>

<p>A few moments after, they all retired
to their rooms. As Eugénie
embraced her father, she could not
refrain from timidly asking him one
question: "Is it really true that M.
Louis' life is not in danger, father?
It would be very sad for so good a
man to be killed by a villain on our
own premises."</p>

<p>"There is no danger, my child,
I assure you," replied Mr. Smithson
kindly. He then tenderly kissed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
daughter for the second time. This
mark of affection on the part of so
cold a man had a special value&mdash;I
might even say, a special significance.</p>

<p>"This voluntary expression of love
from my father," said Eugénie to
herself, "shows he is aware of all I
have suffered, and that he sympathizes
with me." And she went away
full of joy and hope. Once more in
her chamber, she reflected on all the
events of the last few days. Louis
had been calumniated many times
before, and she believed him guilty;
but he had always come out of these
attacks justified, so that the very circumstances
which at first seemed
against him turned to his benefit.
What had happened during the
evening now at an end threw a new
light on the state of affairs. Louis
was an upright man. He was sincere,
and the persecution he had undergone
made him so much the worthier
of being loved. For the first
time, Eugénie ventured to say to
herself boldly: "Yes, I love him!"
Then she prayed for him. At length
a new doubt&mdash;a cruel doubt&mdash;rose in
her heart: "But he, does he love
me?" immediately followed by another
question: if Louis loved her,
would her father consent to receive
him as a son-in-law?... He had
won his esteem&mdash;that was a good
deal; but Mr. Smithson was not a
man to be led away by enthusiasm.
These questions were very embarrassing.
Nor were they all. Eugénie
foresaw many other difficulties also:
Louis was poor; he was a Catholic,
not only in name, but in heart and
deed. His poverty and his piety
were two obstacles to his gaining
Mr. Smithson's entire favor. These
two reasons might prevent him from
ever consenting to give Louis his
daughter's hand. Such were Eugénie's
thoughts. Reflection, instead
of allaying her anxiety, only served
to make it more keen.</p>

<p>"One hope remains," thought she,
"but that is a powerful one: my father
loves me too well to render me
unhappy. I will acknowledge that
the happiness of my life depends on
his decision."</p>

<p>At that same hour, Louis, in the
midst of his sufferings, was a prey to
similar anxiety. But he had one advantage
over Eugénie. "It is not
without some design," he said, "that
Providence has directed everything
with such wonderful goodness. I trust
that, after giving me so clear a
glimpse of happiness, I shall at last
be permitted to attain the reality."</p>

<p>This was by no means certain, for
the designs of God, though ever
merciful, are always unfathomable.
No one can tell beforehand how
things will end. But we must pardon
a little temerity in the heart of a
lover. It is sad to say, but even in
the most upright souls love overpowers
reason.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />

THE BETROTHAL.</h4>

<p>The next morning, Eugénie had
news that surprised her, but seemed
a happy augury: her cousin had
suddenly decided to go home! His
departure was announced by Fanny.
As long as things remained undecided,
and Albert had some hope,
Fanny had appeared cross and dissatisfied.
But now she made her
appearance as she used to be&mdash;smiling,
chatty, and agreeable, without
any one's knowing why. The artful
<em>soubrette</em> felt it was high time to
change her tactics. In consequence
of the blunders Albert had committed,
and Eugénie's marked antipa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>thy
to him, he would henceforth be
blotted out of the list of mademoiselle's
admirers. If, therefore, Fanny
wished to reinstate herself in her
mistress' good graces, if she wished
to make sure of that cherished asylum&mdash;the
object of all her aims for
the last ten years&mdash;she must pave the
way by her subserviency to her future
patrons&mdash;Eugénie and the husband
of her choice, whoever he might
be. With a keener eye, or at least
bolder, than Eugénie's, Fanny had
no doubt it would be Louis.</p>

<p>With the assurance of those people
who make others forget their faults
by appearing to be ignorant of them
themselves, Fanny went with a single
bound over to the side of the man
she regarded as a personal enemy the
night before. Eugénie perceived the
sudden tack. It greatly amused her,
though she pretended not to see it.</p>

<p>"Where is my father?" she asked
Fanny.</p>

<p>"Monsieur is going to town with
M. Albert, and also to notify Mr.
Louis' family of the misfortune that
has happened to him&mdash;a painful errand.
M. Louis has a father who is
greatly attached to him, and a sister
who is still fonder of him&mdash;a very
amiable woman, with a strong mind."</p>

<p>"Ah! indeed; where did you learn
these particulars?"</p>

<p>"Here and there. Mademoiselle
knows the good God has given me
ears to hear with."</p>

<p>"And especially a tongue that can
ask questions, Fanny."</p>

<p>Eugénie went down to the breakfast-room,
where she found the rest
assembled. Mr. Smithson wore a
cheerful air. Albert was in an ill-humor,
which he badly concealed
under pretended elation. Mme.
Smithson appeared anxious, but Eugénie
saw with delight that she was
more affectionate towards her than
she had been of late.</p>

<p>A policeman from St. M&mdash;&mdash; passed
by the window.</p>

<p>"What is that policeman here for?"
inquired Eugénie.</p>

<p>"We had to search Durand's room,
my child," replied Mr. Smithson.
"The man cheated me in a shameful
manner. I have obtained positive
proofs of it. We found letters
from his wife and other people which
prove him utterly heartless and base&mdash;in
short, one of the most dangerous
men I ever saw."</p>

<p>Mr. Smithson and Albert started a
short time after. The parting between
the two cousins was not, as you
may suppose, very affecting. As Mr.
Smithson entered the carriage, he
said to his wife: "Go and tell M.
Louis I am on my way to his father's.
I intend to bring him back with me,
and hope the sister will accompany
him; for no one knows so well how
to take care of him, or to do it so acceptably.
Do not delay giving him
this information; it will do him more
good than a visit from the doctor."</p>

<p>Mme. Smithson made a brief reply,
in which a slight confusion and a
lingering antipathy were perceptible.
The commission was evidently disagreeable,
but she obeyed her husband.
As soon as he was out of
sight, she proceeded towards the
wounded man's room. Eugénie returned
to the house. She expected
her mother would be back in a few
minutes, and was greatly surprised
when a quarter of an hour&mdash;half an
hour&mdash;nearly a whole hour passed
without her returning. She became
extremely anxious. She feared her
mother had found Louis in too dangerous
a state to be left till Mr.
Smithson returned. "Perhaps," she
also thought&mdash;"perhaps mother and
M. Louis are having a painful explanation.
Mother is very kind, but at
times she is dreadful! Exasperated
by my cousin's abrupt departure, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
fear she may, under the impulse of
vexation or animosity, say something
painful to the poor sick fellow...."
And at this, she gave her imagination
full course.</p>

<p>At length Mme. Smithson reappeared.
Eugénie refrained from
questioning her, but she looked as if
she would read the bottom of her
mother's heart.</p>

<p>"We had rather a long talk," said
Mme. Smithson, without appearing
to suspect how anxious her daughter
had been. "He is a good young
man, that M. Louis; a little serious,
a little too gloomy, but that seems
to please certain people!... He is
delighted because his sister is coming...."</p>

<p>"I am not surprised," said Eugénie.</p>

<p>The conversation was kept up for
some time in this discreet tone, neither
of them wishing to let the other
see what she really thought. It
seemed to Eugénie, however, that
her mother, instead of manifesting
any irritation against Louis, was
making an effort to reconcile herself
to him. Had she then an idea he
might become her son-in-law, and
did she wish to accustom herself to a
prospect but recently so contrary to
her views?...</p>

<p>The carriage arrived an hour after.
Eugénie felt somewhat agitated at
the thought of meeting Louis' father
and sister. "Shall I like them? Will
they like me?" she said to herself, as
she proceeded resolutely to the door
to receive them. She first shook
hands with Aline. The poor girl was
pale with anxiety, but her very anxiety
increased her beauty. She made
a conquest of Eugénie at the first
glance. Her thoughtful air, the distinction
of her manners, her intelligent
and animated countenance, were
all pleasing to her. Eugénie felt, if
Aline did not become her friend, it
would be because she did not wish
to. Their interview lasted only a few
minutes; then Aline followed Mr.
Smithson, who had taken her father's
arm, to Louis' room. Eugénie was
also pleased with M. Beauvais. He
had a cold, stern air, but so had Mr.
Smithson himself.</p>

<p>Quite a series of incidents of no
special importance occurred after this,
which it would take too much time
to relate. I must hasten to end my
story, as you wish, I fear.</p>

<p>A week after, Mr. Smithson's house
was <i lang="fr">en fête</i> to celebrate Louis' convalescence.
Both families assembled
on this occasion. Aline, Eugénie,
and Mme. Smithson, who had again
become the excellent woman she was
when we first knew her, formed a
trio of friends such as is seldom
found. And one would have taken
Mr. Smithson and Louis' father for
two old friends from boyhood, so
familiarly did they converse. They
seemed to understand each other at
half a word.</p>

<p>"What a delightful <em>réunion</em>!" said
Mr. Smithson when they came to the
dessert. "It is hard to think we
must all separate to-morrow. But it
is settled that you, M. Louis, are to
come back as soon as you are perfectly
well."</p>

<p>"I give you my word," said Louis;
"and promise also never to leave
you from the time you see me again."</p>

<p>"I hope you will carry out that
intention. We will never separate
again. But you are young, and it is
more difficult for a young man to
foresee what may occur."</p>

<p>"As far as it depends on me, I
can." As Louis said these words, he
glanced at Eugénie, who sat opposite.
His look seemed to say: "There is
the magnet that will keep me here
for ever!" Eugénie blushed. Every
one noticed it.</p>

<p>"It is useless for you to say that,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
said Mr. Smithson. "I shall always
be in fear of your escape till you are
positively bound here. But how
shall we bind you to St. M&mdash;&mdash;?
There is one way," and Mr. Smithson
smiled as he spoke; "which has
occurred to the parents; will the
children consent?"</p>

<p>Eugénie and Louis looked at each
other. In the eyes of both beamed
the same joy.</p>

<p>"The children make no reply, ..."
resumed Mr. Smithson.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," exclaimed Louis.
"I dare not be the first to answer."</p>

<p>"Silence implies consent," replied
Mr. Smithson. "If Eugénie is not
of your mind, let her protest against
it. Otherwise I shall give my own
interpretation to her silence."</p>

<p>"I do not protest," said Eugénie,
unusually intimidated.</p>

<p>"Oh! what strange lovers!" continued
Mr. Smithson. "I think we
shall have to tell them they love
each other."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we are already aware of
it," said Louis. "At least, I have
been for a long time."</p>

<p>"And have you not confessed it to
each other?"</p>

<p>"I had forbidden myself to do so."</p>

<p>"Louis, you have a noble heart,"
said Mr. Smithson. "To keep silence
in such a case requires a courage
amounting to heroism. But I
have remarked that the heroic qualities
you have given so many proofs
of since you came here always turn
to the advantage of those who continue
under their influence. This
proves that God, even in this world,
rewards the deeds of the upright
much oftener than is supposed.
Doubtless they are also recompensed
in heaven, but they often have on
earth a foretaste of what awaits them
hereafter."</p>

<p>Such was the betrothal of my two
friends. The next day, Louis came
to town, in order to obtain the medical
aid necessary to complete his
cure. I had returned myself a few
days previous. I cannot tell you
with what pleasure I received him,
and learned the welcome news from
the lips of the <em>fiancée</em> herself, who
greatly pleased me at the very first
interview, and never gave me any
reason to change my opinion. My
intercourse with them and Aline&mdash;three
choice spirits&mdash;was so delightful
that it sustained me in the midst
of the terrible trials through which I
was then passing. My grief for the
death of my husband had grown
more calm, but his memory followed
me constantly and everywhere.</p>

<p>In addition to my mental troubles,
I underwent physical sufferings that
were sometimes excruciating. And
I was filled with a dread that was
still worse. I trembled at the thought
I might always be a burden to my
poor mother and sister. I had not
fully learned that, when God sends a
trial, he likewise gives the strength to
bear it, and some way of mitigating
it. How many times I have since
realized this! God comes to the aid
of those whose will is in conformity
with his.</p>

<p>The marriage of Louis and Eugénie
took place a month afterwards.
For them, and I might almost say for
myself, it was the beginning of a life
of serene happiness that lasted six
years. The better these two souls
became acquainted, the more they
loved each other. They were always
of the same mind on all subjects
whatever, particularly when there was
a question of doing good. Eugénie,
under her husband's influence, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>came
in a few months a woman of
angelic piety. The good works
Louis had previously begun under
such unfavorable circumstances were
resumed at once, and carried on with
a zeal and prudence that had the
happiest influence on the whole country
round. St. M&mdash;&mdash; was transformed
into a Christian republic.
The wicked&mdash;to be found everywhere&mdash;were
few in number, and, instead
of ruling over the good, considered
themselves fortunate in being tolerated.
Ah! if it were thus everywhere!... Every
summer, I went
to pass three months with my friends.
I was happier there than I can express.
It was delightful to behold a
family so admirably united, so beloved
and respected everywhere
around! Mr. Smithson himself was
hardly to be recognized. The sight
of the wonders effected by his son-in-law
and daughter destroyed one by
one all his prejudices against the
true religion....</p>

<p>Alas! the happiness of this world
is seldom of long duration. Eugénie
had been married six years, and was
the mother of two children, when she
was seized with a severe illness that
endangered her life. She got over
it, however, but remained feeble and
languid. The physicians insisted on
her residing permanently in the South.
A large manufactory being for sale
on the delightful shores of the Mediterranean,
a few leagues from Marseilles,
on the picturesque and charming
road leading from the Phocæan
City to Toulon, Louis purchased it,
and they all went away!</p>

<p>No words could describe the sadness
they experienced at leaving so dear
a spot as St. M&mdash;&mdash;, where they were
greatly beloved. They likewise regretted
separating from me. When
I saw them start, I felt almost as distressed
as I was at the death of my
husband; but I did not tell them so,
for fear of increasing their regret.
After they went to Provence, they had
one more year of happiness; but the
amelioration that took place in Eugénie's
health did not last any longer.
She died three months later.</p>

<p>Some time after, Louis came to
seek consolation from his sister and
me. His very aspect made us heartsick.
His grief was beyond the
reach of any human consolation. It
would have been wrong had he voluntarily
given himself up to it. But,
no; he struggled against it. It prevailed,
however, in spite of himself,
as phthisis resists every remedy and
wears the sufferer to the grave. We
represented to him the good he
might still effect, and reminded him
he had one child left to bring up;
the other being dead. He listened
kindly to our representations, and
said he had had more happiness on
earth than he merited; that he submitted
to the divine will, and resigned
himself to live as long as God
wished. But all this was said with a
dejection and involuntary weariness
of everything, that was no good sign.
Louis was one of those souls, all
sensibility, who die as soon as their
hearts receive a deep wound. Had
he been an unbeliever, he would have
taken his own life, or died of grief in
a few months. Religion sustained
him four years longer.</p>

<p>During that time, his friends always
found him resigned. He became
more devout than ever, and
more zealous in doing good. A
sudden illness at length carried him
off. The physicians asserted that
he might have recovered if grief
had not undermined his constitution,
once so robust. When he died, he
left his son to be brought up by
his sister. God gave him the happiness,
before his death, of seeing his
father-in-law enter the bosom of the
church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>Madame Agnes had finished her
story.</p>

<p>"Such, my friend, is the history
of my life," said she. "It is not
very entertaining, I confess, but I
think it instructive. All who had a
part in it suffered, but they never
lost courage. Such a misfortune
could not happen to them, because
they only expected from life what it
has to give&mdash;many days of trial, mingled
with some that are joyful. But
whether their days were sad or joyful,
my friends were never deprived
of the light of the divine presence.
They received from the hand of God
happiness and sorrow with equal
gratitude, aware that he disposes all
things for the good of those he loves,
and that in him all they have loved
on earth will be found again.</p>

<p>"My friend, imitate the example
of these dear ones now gone! Keep
intact the gift of faith, which was
their dearest, most precious treasure.
Let it also be yours! If you rely on
God, you will never lack resignation
and hope, even in the midst of the
most bitter trials. Faith, while waiting
to open the gates of heaven to you&mdash;faith,
practical and ardent, wonderfully
softens every trial here below."</p>

<h3>DANIEL O'CONNELL.</h3>


<p>The good old saying, that it never
rains but it pours, has received additional
illustration in the appearance
within a very short time of two lives
and one memoir of the great Irish
agitator, the late Daniel O'Connell.
The latter, it is true, is a mere sketch,
intended only as an introduction to
a collection of ten or twelve of the
most noteworthy speeches of that
distinguished man, judiciously selected
from hundreds which, as a lawyer,
politician, and parliamentary debater,
he had delivered in the course of a
remarkably busy life, extending over
nearly half a century. In this regard,
if in no other, it will be found
interesting and useful to those who
have not leisure or inclination to
study the history of his career in
detail.</p>

<p>Of Mr. Luby's work, published
originally in parts, many of which
we have carefully perused, we have
little to say. It is evidently written
in haste, loosely, and without due
regard to the canons which are generally
supposed to govern composition
and narration. There are no
facts or incidents in it bearing on
the public or private life of O'Connell
that are not already well known
to every person of ordinary intelligence,
and which have not been
better and more lucidly presented to
the public years ago. It has the
demerit, also, of being altogether too
discursive, not to say blatant, in
style, and the author is too constantly
wandering away from his subject
to matters quite disconnected from
the actions and peculiarities of his
hero. Judging from this production,
Mr. Luby seems to be a very unfit
person to portray the genius, aims,
and designs of the great Irish popular
leader, lacking as he does that
earnest sympathy which should exist
between the biographer and his
subject, as well as that judicial and
philosophical insight into the secret
springs of human action which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
while recording patent facts, can
comprehend and elucidate the true
motives, designs, and probable results
of the deeds related. Such has ever
been considered the real end of biographical
literature.</p>

<p>In this respect, the <cite>Life of O'Connell</cite>,
by Sister Mary Francis Clare,
is much superior to Mr. Luby's, as it
is in every other essential quality,
though in itself far inferior to what
might have been expected from so
popular a writer, particularly when
dealing with so great and congenial
a theme. In her book of
eight hundred pages, the good religious
has shown a vast amount of
industry, a genuine appreciation of
the character, labors, and conduct of
the Liberator, and considerable literary
skill in presenting them to the
public in the most attractive and
readable form. The correspondence
between O'Connell and the venerable
Archbishop of Tuam, now for
the first time published, constitutes a
most valuable, perhaps the most valuable,
feature in the work, and, as a
glimpse at the inner life of the busy
lawyer and untiring agitator, will be
read with particular gratification by
the admirers of his extraordinary
abilities in this country. Here, we
regret to say, our praise of Miss Cusack's
book must end. As a biography
of one of the most remarkable
public men of this century or of
any country, it is not a decided success,
and, as coming from the pen of
an experienced, facile, and patriotic
writer, it will, we do not doubt, disappoint
the majority of her admirers
at home and abroad. With the exception
of the letters to Abp. McHale,
alluded to above, and some original
notes and appendices supplied by
friends, the facts, incidents, and anecdotes
recounted of the Irish leader
are mainly taken from such books
as those of O'Neill Daunt, Fegan,
Sheil, and his own son, John O'Connell,
all of which may be found in
an anonymous compilation published
five or six years ago.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>We do not find fault so much with
the fact that it is so largely a compilation,
as with the crude manner in
which the extracts from those works
are collated and presented to the
public. We can even point to several
instances where they are inserted
bodily in the text, as original, without
quotation-marks, foot-notes, or
any other sign of reference. This
may or may not be the fault of the
printer, but the examples are so numerous
as to incline us to the latter
opinion. We have often admired the
industry of Miss Cusack in bringing
out so many good books in such
rapid succession; as well as her zeal
in endeavoring to aid, by the products
of her genius, a most meritorious
charity; but we hold it to be
against the laws both of fair play
and literary courtesy to neglect to
accord to the labors of others a
proper share of acknowledgment.</p>

<p>We do not want to be unreasonable.
Had the gifted authoress allowed
herself more time, and related
the dramatic story of O'Connell's
life entirely in her own words, we
would have been satisfied. We do
not expect that a lady secluded from
the world, necessarily devoting the
greater part of her time to the duties
of her calling, and consequently
practically unacquainted with the
outside political world, its storms,
passions, and intrigues, can treat us
to anything like a full or elaborate
disquisition on the circumstances,
dangers, and difficulties which surrounded
and impeded the career of
such a man as the emancipator of
the Catholics of Great Britain an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>d
Ireland. Only a person who has
devoted much time to the examination
of the history of Ireland and
England, for the past hundred years,
at least; who himself has been a
participant in, or an interested spectator
of, the unceasing conflict which
during that period was naturally
waged between the Irish nationalists
and their opponents, can attempt
to do so. This war was carried on
in every relation of life; at the bar,
on the bench; in the pulpit, press,
and forum; in the workshop, the
club, and the halls of St. Stephen;
and the central figure, the invincible
leader of the aggressive and at
length victorious national party, was
O'Connell&mdash;the man who for near
half a century dared all opposition
and defied all hostile power in the
championship of the cause of his
persecuted countrymen and co-religionists.</p>

<p>However men may differ as to the
wisdom, policy, or honesty of O'Connell,
none will deny that he was a
man of stupendous intellect and indomitable
perseverance. In everything
he was gigantic. In physique,
mental attainments, courage, virtues,
and even in his errors, he was decidedly
great. There was nothing small
or dwarfed about him; and as, a popular
leader while living, he seemed to
hold in his hand the control of the
masses of his countrymen; so, when
dead, the very mention of his name
is enough to awaken the gratitude
and evoke the admiration of millions
of the present generation, whose advent
into the world succeeded his demise.
Not only in Ireland was he
trusted, beloved, and revered, but on
the continent of Europe and in this
country his name was associated with
the cause of civil and religious liberty,
and his every movement watched
with interest by all classes. And
when at length, worn down by his
excessive labors in behalf of faith and
liberty, he yielded up his soul to his
Creator, his piety and patriotism became
the subjects of unqualified encomiums
from the noblest and most
distinguished orators in both hemispheres.
Surely so great an embodiment
of zeal and genius, well
directed, deserves a fitting chronicler.</p>

<p>Born of a house never remarkable
before nor since his time for attachment
to creed or country; educated
far from the influences of his native
land, we find him returning to it just
as he had completed his majority, an
accomplished scholar and a barrister,
with nothing to depend upon but his
own labors for support, yet full of
ambition and eager for distinction.
Had he followed the traditions of his
family, he would have settled down
quietly to the practice of his profession,
and in course of time, doubtless,
would have become wealthy and a
useful assistant to the hostile power
that controlled the destinies of his
nation, as too many of his professional
brothers had already done. But
the young lawyer, to the dismay of
many of his relations, soon showed
that he was made of sterner stuff.
He could not "bend the pregnant
hinges of the knee, that thrift might
follow fawning." He had arrived
home in time to witness the horrors
of '98; he had seen his fellow-Catholics,
even then four-fifths of the population
of Ireland, bowed down to the
very dust, sneered at, reprobated,
and, on their own soil, denied every
social, commercial, and political right
to which as freemen they were entitled;
and, with a courage that never
deserted him, and a capacity for labor
that was truly remarkable, he ranged
himself on the side of the proscribed,
and took up the gauntlet cast down
to the oppressed by the powerful and
unscrupulous faction which then, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
now, represented British supremacy
in Ireland.</p>

<p>His first appearance in public, being
then but twenty-three years old,
was in 1799, when the question of a
legislative union between Ireland
and England convulsed the former
and deeply moved the public mind
of the latter country. At a meeting
in Dublin, he denounced the measure
in terms so bold, clear, and forcible
that those who listened to him had
little difficulty in foreseeing his future
eminence and usefulness to the
national cause. The scheme of Pitt
and Castlereagh was, however, carried
out, the Irish parliament was destroyed,
and the Catholics saw themselves
at the beginning of the century not
only without a domestic legislature,
but shut out from all representation,
not only in the united Lords and
Commons, but even in the most insignificant
corporation and local boards.</p>

<p>Where, then, could the ardent
young patriot, gifted, enthusiastic,
and impatient of the restrictions
placed upon himself and his fellow-countrymen,
find an audience and
an outlet for the fiery eloquence
that heaved and burned in his soul?
Clearly in popular gatherings and
in the courts of law. But the people
at that time were so timid,
nay, so degraded, that they dared
not assemble in any force to protest
against the tyranny that had for
so many generations enslaved them;
or, if a few hundreds did assemble
together, the sight of a magistrate,
or the presence of some truculent
follower of the castle, like the infamous
Maj. Sirr, was sufficient to disperse
them, while the few Catholic
noblemen and gentry yet left were
as timid as so many hares. The
Irish Catholics of that epoch, so
long trodden under foot, and deprived
absolutely of political power
and landed interests, were not like
the Catholics of to-day, who, in all
thankfulness be it said, are triumphantly
bearing aloft the banner of
the church when so much of Europe
is trailing it in the mire of infidelity
and communism. Then Wolfe Tone,
once their secretary, in his <cite>Memoirs</cite>,
and Wyse, in his <cite>History of the Catholic
Association</cite>, likened them to the
servile Jews, and described them as
deficient in manliness and self-respect.
They crawled at the feet of
a hostile government, says the latter,
fawned on their Protestant neighbors,
and felt honored by being even noticed
by persons of that creed, even
though in every respect their inferiors.
Such people had very little
business in the civil courts to give,
and what little they had they gave
to those who loathed their creed and
despised themselves.</p>

<p>O'Connell soon saw that nothing
could be effected in the way of popular
demonstrations with such unpromising
materials. He therefore adopted
another and a wiser course. The
courts became his fulcrum, and his
eloquence the lever, by which he
sought to raise the spirit of the nation.
Term after term, year after
year, his potent voice was heard
ringing through the halls of justice
by an astonished bar and delighted
and electrified audiences, in the defence
of the victims of landlord
tyranny or official persecution. His
arguments to the bench, and his harangues
to the jury, were always full
of fire, audacity, and logic, and
were seldom, even in the face of
unmitigated prejudice, unsuccessful.
Pathos and humor, wit and vituperation,
strong appeals to the patriotism
of his hearers, and stern denunciations
of the rashness and folly of
some of his compatriots, were with
him invariably mingled with sound
common sense and unerring legal
acumen. So great, indeed, was his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
success as a pleader in criminal cases,
so unlimited his resources in difficult
motions, and so general his triumphs
over ignorance and bigotry, that,
before most of his fellow-practitioners
had earned their first fees, he
found himself in the enjoyment of
a lucrative practice, and, what to
him was an object of much greater
importance, the spokesman of the
degraded majority, and the oracle
of his people. His forensic efforts
were not confined to judges and
juries exclusively. He lost no opportunity
of throwing into his legal
arguments and speeches some remarks
for the benefit of the masses
who always throng Irish courts&mdash;remarks
which never failed to elicit
the wildest delight and the most
hearty applause.</p>

<p>In this indirect way he was gradually
infusing into his countrymen that
spirit of manhood which so powerfully
moved himself. As an evidence
of this, we may quote an extract,
though a long one, from his speech
in defence of Magee, editor of the
<cite>Evening Post</cite>, then the most influential
advocate of Catholic rights
in Ireland. In 1813, Magee was
prosecuted for a libel on the Duke
of Richmond, the retiring lord-lieutenant;
and as the crown officers
in their speeches, and, as it appeared,
by previous arrangement, endeavored
to give to the trial&mdash;having first
selected a jury to suit themselves&mdash;a
political significance, Magee's counsel
willingly joined issue with them on
their own terms. The array of legal
ability on both sides was proportionate
to the gravity of the question
involved. For the government
appeared the Attorney-General, Saurin,
the Solicitor-General, Bushe,
and Sergeants Moore, Ball, and McMahon;
for the defence, O'Connell,
assisted by Messrs. Wallace, Hamilton,
Findley, and Philips. Saurin, in
his opening, alluding to the Catholic
Board, of which the defendant's newspaper
was the organ, made use of
these words: "If the libel only
related to him [Richmond], it would
have gone by unprosecuted by me.
But the imputation is made against
the administration of justice by the
government of Ireland, and it forms
only a part of a system of calumny
with which an association of factious
and revolutionary men are in the
habit of vilifying every constitutional
authority in the land." The opportunity
thus afforded O'Connell was
instantly and dexterously seized by
him to reply with more than his
usual boldness and wealth of invective.
In the course of his long address
to the jury, he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"My lord, upon the Catholic subject I
commence with one assertion of the
Attorney-General, which I trust I misunderstood.
He talked, as I collected
him, of the Catholics having imbibed
principles of a seditious, treasonable,
and revolutionary nature! He seemed
to me most distinctly to charge us with
treason! There is no relying on his
words for his meaning&mdash;I know there is
not. On a former occasion, I took down
a repetition of this charge full seventeen
times on my brief; and yet afterwards it
turned out that he never intended to
make any such charge; that he forgot he
had ever used those words, and he disclaimed
the idea they naturally convey.
It is clear, therefore, that upon this subject
he knows not what he says; and
that these phrases are the mere flowers
of his rhetoric, but quite innocent of any
meaning!</p>

<p>"Upon this account I pass him by, I
go beyond him, and I content myself
with proclaiming those charges, whosoever
may make them, to be false and
base calumnies! It is impossible to
refute such charges in the language of
dignity or temper. But if any man dares
to charge the Catholic body, or the
Catholic Board, or any individuals of
that Board, with sedition or treason, I do
here, I shall always in this court, in the
city, in the field, brand him as an infamous
and profligate liar!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
<p>"Pardon the phrase, but there is no
other suitable to the occasion. But he
is a profligate liar who so asserts, because
he must know that the whole tenor
of our conduct confutes the assertion.
What is it we seek?"</p>

<p>"<em>Chief-Justice.</em>&mdash;What, Mr. O'Connell,
can this have to do with the question
which the jury are to try?"</p>

<p>"<em>Mr. O'Connell.</em>&mdash;You heard the Attorney-General
traduce and calumniate us;
you heard him with patience and with
temper&mdash;listen now to our vindication!</p>

<p>"I ask, What is it we seek? What is
it we incessantly, and, if you please,
clamorously, petition for? Why, to be
allowed to partake of the advantages of
the constitution. We are earnestly anxious
to share the benefits of the constitution.
We look to the participation in
the constitution as our greatest political
blessing. If we desired to destroy it,
would we seek to share it? If we wished
to overturn it, would we exert ourselves
through calumny, and in peril, to
obtain a portion of its blessings? Strange,
inconsistent voice of calumny! You
charge us with intemperance in our
exertions for a participation in the
constitution, and you charge us at the
same time, almost in the same sentence,
with a design to overturn the constitution.
The dupes of your hypocrisy may
believe you; but, base calumniators, you
do not, you cannot believe yourselves!</p>

<p>"The Attorney-General&mdash;'this wisest
and best of men,' as his colleague, the
Solicitor-General, called him in his presence,&mdash;the
Attorney-General next boasted
of his triumph over Pope and Popery;
'I put down the Catholic Committee; I
will put down, at my good time, the
Catholic Board.' This boast is partly
historical, partly prophecy. He was
wrong in his history&mdash;he is quite mistaken
in his prophecy. He did not put
down the Catholic Committee; we gave
up that name the moment that this sapient
Attorney-General's polemico-legal
controversy dwindled into a mere dispute
about words. He told us that, in the
English language, 'pretence' means 'purpose.'
Had it been French and not English,
we might have been inclined to respect
his judgment; but in point of English,
we venture to differ with him. We
told him, 'Purpose,' good Mr. Attorney-General,
is just the reverse of 'pretence.'
The quarrel grew warm and animated.
We appealed to common sense, to the
grammar, and to the dictionary; common
sense, grammar, and the dictionary decided
in our favor. He brought his appeal
to this court, your lordship, and
your brethren unanimously decided that
in point of law&mdash;mark, mark, gentlemen
of the jury, the sublime wisdom of the
law&mdash;the court decided that, in point of
law, 'pretence' does mean 'purpose'!</p>

<p>"Fully contented with this very reasonable
and most satisfactory decision,
there still remained a matter of fact between
us. The Attorney-General charged
us with being representatives; we denied
all representation. He had two witnesses
to prove the fact for him; they
swore to it one way at one trial, and directly
the other way at the next. An honorable,
intelligent, and enlightened jury
disbelieved those witnesses at the first
trial; matters were better managed at the
second trial&mdash;the jury were better arranged.
I speak delicately, gentlemen:
the jury were better arranged, as the witnesses
were better informed; and, accordingly,
there was one verdict for us
on the representative question, and one
verdict against us....</p>

<p>"Let me pledge myself to you that he
imposes on you when he threatens to
crush the Catholic Board. Illegal violence
may do it, force may effectuate it;
but your hopes and his will be defeated
if he attempts it by any course of law. I
am, if not a lawyer, at least a barrister.
On this subject I ought to know something,
and I do not hesitate to contradict
the Attorney-General on this point, and
to proclaim to you and to the country
that the Catholic Board is a perfectly
legal assembly; that it not only does not
violate the law, but that it is entitled to
the protection of the law; and in the very
proudest tone of firmness, I hurl defiance
at the Attorney-General!</p>

<p>"I defy him to allege a law or a statute,
or even a proclamation, that is violated
by the Catholic Board. No, gentlemen, no;
his religious prejudices&mdash;if the absence
of every charity can be called anything
religious,&mdash;his religious prejudices really
obscure his reason, his bigoted intolerance
has totally darkened his understanding,
and he mistakes the plainest
facts, and misquotes the clearest law, in
the ardor and vehemence of his rancor.
I disclaim his moderation, I scorn his
forbearance. I tell him he knows not
the law, if he thinks as he says; and
if he thinks so, I tell him to his beard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
that he is not honest in not having sooner
prosecuted us, and I challenge him to
that prosecution."<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p></div>

<p>Those were brave words, such as
the ears of the English officials were
unused to hear, but which found a
responsive echo in the hearts of millions
of the oppressed Catholics, degraded
and enthralled as they were
at that time. On the first day of its
publication, ten thousand copies of
the entire address were sold, and in a
short time it was to be found in nearly
every house and place of public
resort in the country. It was also
translated into French and Spanish,
and eagerly read and commented
upon on the continent. In fact, this
trial may be considered the true initial
point of the great Catholic movement
which culminated in emancipation
sixteen years afterwards.</p>

<p>To a man of less indomitable will
and less transcendent legal abilities,
a course such as O'Connell had
adopted would have been utterly
ruinous. Then, as now, but to a
far greater extent, the Irish judges
were the mere creatures of the castle,
and their least frown or sneer was
considered sufficient to blast the prospects
of any young aspirant for professional
honors, even if he were only
suspected of patriotic leanings. But
in the future Emancipator they met
their equal, not only in point of legal
knowledge, but their superior in
moral courage and in that mental
force which, like a torrent, swept
everything before it. The following
anecdotes, told of O'Connell while in
active practice, illustrate his method
of dealing with the government jurists:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Happening to be one day present in
the courts in Dublin, where a discussion
arose on a motion for a new trial, a young
attorney was called upon by the opposing
counsel either to admit a statement as
evidence, or hand in some document he
could legally detain. O'Connell stood
up, and told the attorney to make no admission.</p>

<p>"'Have you a brief in this case, Mr.
O'Connell?' asked Baron McCleland,
with very peculiar emphasis.</p>

<p>"'I have not, my lord; but I shall have
one when the case goes down to the
assizes.'</p>

<p>"'When <em>I</em> was at the bar, it was not <em>my</em>
habit to anticipate briefs.'</p>

<p>"'When <em>you</em> were at the bar, I never
chose <em>you</em> for a model; and now that you
are on the bench, I shall not submit to
your dictation.'</p>

<p>"Leaving the judge to digest this retort,
he walked out of the court, accompanied
by the young attorney.</p>

<p>"At a case tried at the Cork assizes, a
point arose touching the legality of certain
evidence, which O'Connell argued
was clearly admissible. He sustained
his own view very fully, reasoning with
that force and clearness, and quoting precedent
with that facility, for which he was
distinguished. But it was to no purpose.
The court ruled against him, and the
witnesses were shut out. The trial was
of extraordinary length, and at the close
of the day the proceedings were not
ended. On the following morning, when
the case was about to be resumed, the
judge addressed O'Connell:</p>

<p>"'I have reconsidered my decision of
yesterday,' said his lordship, 'and my
present opinion is that the evidence
tendered by you should not have been
rejected. You can, therefore, reproduce
the evidence now.'</p>

<p>"Instead of obsequiously thanking him
for his condescension, as another would
have done, O'Connell's impatience broke
out:</p>

<p>"'Had your lordship known as much
law yesterday as you do to-day,' said he
bitterly, 'you would have spared me a
vast amount of time and trouble, and my
client a considerable amount of injury.
Crier, call up the witnesses.'"<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p></div>

<p>The career of the great criminal
lawyer&mdash;for his civil business was
comparatively small&mdash;lasted for more
than a generation, and his success
was uniform and uninterrupted, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
his fees in the aggregate, for that
time, were enormous. "A single
fact," says the author just quoted,
"will demonstrate the confidence
which the Irish public placed at this
period in the professional abilities of
O'Connell. In the autumnal assizes
of 1813, twenty-six cases were tried
in the Limerick Record Court. In
every one of these O'Connell held a
brief. He was likewise retained in
every criminal case tried in the same
city. His professional career was
equally triumphant and extraordinary
in the autumn assizes of Ennis;
while in Cork and his native province,
Kerry, it was that year, if
possible, exceeded. At this golden
period of his life, his prosperity, flowing
from his brilliant abilities, and his
popularity, springing from his country's
gratitude, rendered his position
at the bar in the highest degree enviable."</p>

<p>But it was not as a jurist or an
advocate that O'Connell was destined
to hand down his name to posterity
covered with imperishable glory. He
only used his great professional success
to further two ends. Like a
true patriot, and, <i lang="fr">à fortiori</i>, unlike the
politicians of to-day, he desired first
to establish his own independence before
attempting to obtain that of his
countrymen, knowing well that poverty,
associated with ambition, is
too often the means of leading men,
otherwise honest, into the commission
of acts not always honorable or meritorious.
Then, also, as we have before
intimated, he desired, under the protection
of the court, to instil into the
hearts and souls of the dejected
Catholics a spirit of manliness and
courage by his burning appeals to
courts and juries&mdash;words which, if
uttered out of court, would have entailed
on him endless prosecutions
and proscription.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, O'Connell cannot
be considered as the leader of the
Irish Catholics till 1820, when Henry
Grattan died. That brilliant orator
and inflexible patriot, though a
Protestant, always enjoyed the confidence
and esteem of the persecuted
masses; and whether in or out of Parliament,
in College Green or St. Stephen's,
his conduct was ever such as
to command their respect and affection.
O'Connell, on the contrary, up
to that date, was unable to control
for any length of time the feeble
movements which, during the previous
decade, had been made by the
Catholic body to obtain some redress
of their grievances. His audacious
denunciation of the government, and
his contempt for the advocates of
half measures, frightened away such
lukewarm Catholics as Lords Fingal,
Trimleston, and French; while his
superior foresight, skill, and perhaps
arrogance, frequently led him into
disputes with the less clear-headed
and more violent of his other associates.
A portion of the national
press, also, looked coldly upon the
burly lawyer, fearing his ambition;
while many of the clergy and bishops
hesitated to yield implicit confidence
to a man who was once a freemason,
and a good deal of whose leisure
time, it was said, was spent amid the
<em>convives</em> of the capital. The "Catholic
Committee," which was mainly his
creation, was established in 1808, and
easily suppressed by the government,
after a useless existence of less than
three years. Its successor, the "Catholic
Board," was equally powerless,
and even more given to internal dissensions;
and after its demise, in 1814,
nine years elapsed, during which the
Catholics, divided, dispirited, and
despairing, made no effort whatever
for their rights, unless the forwarding
of an odd petition to the English
Parliament might be called so.</p>

<p>In fact, the generation that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
witnessed the horrors of '98 and the
wholesale perfidy of the men who
planned and passed the act of union,
were not fit to carry on a manly, determined
agitation: fear had been
driven into their very marrow, and
the badge of slavery was worn with a
calmness that closely resembled contentment.
It required a new generation
to conduct such a movement
with success, and a leader to point
the way to victory.</p>

<p>Time at last brought both. The
first sign of returning life in the people
was evinced upon the occasion
of a relief bill having been introduced
into the House of Commons
in 1821, and passed by that body
by nineteen majority. Though of
course defeated by the Lords, its partial
success, and the unexpected support
it received from some of the
more distinguished members, had a
salutary effect on the public mind in
Ireland, and aroused hopes that had
long lain dormant in the bosom of
the Catholic party. Meetings began
to be held in different parts of the
provinces, and at length a <cite>Catholic
Association</cite> was formed in Dublin,
April 28, 1823. Its founder was
O'Connell, then in his prime, physically
and mentally; his reputation
as an orator and a statesman beyond
question; his impetuosity mollified,
if not subdued; and his judgment
matured by long experience
of actual life. At first the association
numbered but a few individuals;
so few, indeed, that after it had
been a year in existence, it was difficult
to get the necessary quorum of
members to attend its stated meetings;
but a combination of circumstances
almost providential, and certainly
unexpected, occurred, which
gave the movement an irresistible
impulse. The hierarchy of Ireland
unanimously endorsed the movement;
the clergy not only approved
of it, but were active in extending the
organization; the poet Moore dropped
the lyre, and took up the pen
controversial; the illustrious "J. K.
L." thundered through the press;
while the halls of Parliament rang
with the eloquence of Brougham,
Mackintosh, and Sir F. Burdett.
The rent or revenue to conduct and
disseminate a knowledge of the principles
of the association flowed in with
unparalleled generosity, sometimes
as much as ten thousand dollars
being received weekly by the treasurer.
O'Connell was the head and
front, the vivifying principle, organizer,
and counsellor of this grand
uprising of an enslaved people; and
his efforts were as untiring as his
advice was judicious and well timed.</p>

<p>At length the government, the
supporters of Protestant ascendency,
became alarmed, and at the session
of 1825 of the British Parliament a
bill was introduced to suppress the
association. That body immediately
delegated O'Connell and R. L.
Sheil to attend the bar of the House,
and offer their testimony as to the
perfect legality of the organization.
They attended, but were not heard,
though admitted to seats in the body
of the chamber. Still, they were ably
represented by Brougham and other
influential members. Speaking of
the two delegates, the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>
of that day well said: "No men
in circumstances so difficult and
delicate ever behaved with greater
temper and moderation, or more
recommended themselves to all parties
by their fairness and the conciliatory
manner of their proceedings.
Of necessity ignorant of the men
with whom they were called upon to
act, they could not avoid falling into
some errors.... The sanguine
temper which made them give ear
to the hope [of emancipation] so unaccountably
held out by some per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>sons,
is to be reckoned the chief of
these mistakes; for it led to far too
much carelessness about the blow to
be levelled at the association....
When the bill was prepared for
putting down the association, a debate
ensued, not, perhaps, paralleled
in parliamentary history for its importance
and the sustained excellence
which marked the whole compass of
its duration. Four whole nights did
this memorable contest last, if contest
it might be called, where all the
strength lay, except that of numbers,
on one side. The effect produced
by this debate out of doors and within
the Parliament itself was truly important.
The whole range of Irish
policy was discussed, all the grievances
of Ireland were openly canvassed,
the conduct of the government
freely arraigned, and such a
death-blow given to the cry of 'No
Popery!' and the other delusions of
the High-Church party that intolerance
lost more ground that night
than it had ever hoped to regain by
the alarm which the association enabled
it to excite. The conduct of
that body was most triumphantly
defended, and it appeared plainly
that the peace of Ireland had been
restored by its exertions and maintained
by its influence."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the act passed and
the association was dissolved, but
only to reappear in another form.
The cause of emancipation had
gained many and powerful friends,
not the least of whom was the editor
of the quarterly just quoted. A
new <cite>Catholic Association</cite> was formed
the same year, and the work of
arousing the supine masses went
bravely on. Meetings were held simultaneously
in the various centres of
population, at one or more of which
O'Connell was generally present; for
he seemed ubiquitous. The patriotic
newspapers teemed with speeches,
communications, and extracts, all
directed to the same purpose. The
country was in a state of tremendous
fermentation, to a degree that it
was thought impossible it could go
further, till the Emancipator himself,
by a masterly stroke of policy, which
could only have been the inspiration
of genius, resolved to get himself
elected to Parliament, and "carry the
war into Africa." Ireland was now
thoroughly aroused and organized;
so he resolved, if he could not convince
or persuade England to do her
justice, at least to shock the latter
into something like equity, or expose
her to the world as an oppressor
and a hypocrite. He had seen what
beneficial effects had followed the
debate on the "Algerine Bill," and
he was determined not to rest till all
Europe, all Christendom, should become
familiar with the wrongs of the
Catholics. In 1828, a vacancy occurred
in the representation of Clare.
O'Connell presented himself as a candidate,
was against all odds elected,
and immediately proceeded to London.</p>

<p>Events, however, hurried on so fast
that he had not time to present himself
to the Commons before the great
measure for which he had so long
struggled, and for which millions had
prayed for years, had passed. On
the 22d of January, 1828, the Duke
of Wellington was appointed First
Lord of the Treasury. Towards the
end of that year, the Catholic Association
was voluntarily dissolved, in
conformity to a preconcerted plan
between the Irish Catholics and the
British Ministry, having first passed
unanimously the following resolution:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"That, as the last act of this body, we
do declare that we are indebted to Daniel
O'Connell, beyond all other men, for its
original creation and sustainment, and
that he is entitled, for the achievement
of its freedom, to the everlasting gratitude
of Ireland."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 13th of April, 1829, the
Emancipation Act received the royal
signature, the bill having passed the
House by an overwhelming vote, and
the Lords by one hundred and four
majority.</p>

<p>Many persons fondly thought that
this law had laid the fell spirit of
Protestant bigotry for ever; but it was
not so. The snake was only scotched,
not killed. It required another blow
to render it completely innoxious.
O'Connell, who had been elected before
the bill passed, claimed a right
to a seat in the Commons, even
though a Catholic, and in support of
that claim presented himself early in
the session. The scene that ensued
is thus described by an eye-witness:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is impossible to convey a perfect
idea of the silent, the almost breathless
attention with which O'Connell was
watched and perused, when, in compliance
with the request of the speaker, he
advanced to the table. So large a number
of peers had never been previously
seen in that House. Two members of
the aristocracy accompanied O'Connell,
and, as a matter of form, introduced him to
the House. Their names were Ebrington
and Dungannon. As he passed the bar
of the House, every eye was fixed on him.
The first oath tendered to O'Connell was
that of the supremacy, which he was seen,
by the silent and watching multitude, to
wave away and refuse. They heard him
say: 'I apply to take my seat under the
new act. I am ready to take the oath directed
to be taken by Roman Catholic members.
I do not feel that I am bound to
take <em>these</em> oaths.' As he uttered these
last words, he passed his hand over the
oaths which he objected to, and which were
affixed to pasteboards. 'You will be good
enough,' added O'Connell, 'to inform the
speaker that I do not think I am bound
to take these oaths.' The chief clerk
gathered up the pieces of pasteboard,
and hurried up with them to the speaker,
where he was seen pointing out to that
functionary the oaths which O'Connell
refused to take. The speaker then rose
and said that, unless the new member
took the old oaths, he must withdraw.
The speaker alluded to those blasphemous
oaths whose injustice was so flagrant
that they had been just repealed. O'Connell,
it is said, requested that the oath of
qualification, stating that he possessed
six hundred a year, should be administered
to him; but this was likewise refused.
During all this time, the speaker's
manner and expression of countenance
towards O'Connell, on whom he
fixed his regards, were extremely courteous,
but the declaration that he must
withdraw firm and authoritative. O'Connell
looked round, as if expecting support;
but this failing, he bowed, and
stood facing the speaker in perfect silence.
At this moment, Brougham was
seen to rise; but before he could address
the house, the speaker exclaimed
'Order!' and again intimated to O'Connell
that he must withdraw. The latter
bowed respectfully, and, without uttering
a single syllable, withdrew. After his departure,
Brougham, who was still on his
legs, addressed the house in a subdued
tone, and, after some discussion, the debate
was postponed.</p>

<p>"May 18, 1829, was a memorable day
in the history of O'Connell's eventful
life. Peel, rising in the House of
Commons on that day, moved that
O'Connell should be heard at the bar&mdash;a
motion which was carried. Accordingly,
he advanced to the bar, attended by
Pierce Mahony&mdash;the whole house regarding
him with the most intense interest.
He addressed the house in a long and
elaborate speech, in which he clearly
demonstrated his right. His courteous
manner and temperate address conciliated,
in some degree, the good opinion
of the members. He exhibited that flexibility
of mind, that power of accommodating
himself to his auditory, which
formed his most remarkable attribute.
When he concluded, the question was
taken up by the lawyers, who endeavored
to explain the meaning of the new act to
the very men who had passed it. As the
aristocracy had previously determined
that O'Connell should not sit, the members
of the lower house, who always do
their bidding, rejected O'Connell's claim.</p>

<p>"Retiring with Pierce Mahony by his
side, O'Connell endeavored to recover
the seat which he had occupied previously
to his appearance at the table. But to
his surprise, he found two gentlemen in
possession of it. They were Frenchmen,
but spoke English like natives. One of
these men afterwards reigned in France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
as Louis Philippe. The other was his
son, the Duke of Orleans.</p>

<p>"The following day, O'Connell appeared
for the third time at the bar of the
House. He was told by the speaker that
unless he took the oath of supremacy,
the House would not permit him to take
his seat.</p>

<p>"'Are you willing to take the oath of
supremacy?' asked the speaker.</p>

<p>"'Allow me to look at it,' replied
O'Connell.</p>

<p>"The oath was handed to O'Connell,
and he looked at it in silence for a few seconds;
then raising his head, he said: 'In
this oath I see one assertion as to a matter
of fact, which I <em>know</em> to be untrue. I
see a second assertion as to a matter of
opinion, which I <em>believe</em> to be untrue. I
therefore refuse to take this oath.' A
writ was immediately issued for a new
election."</p></div>

<p>He was again triumphantly elected
for Clare, and from thenceforth till his
death occupied a seat in the House,
representing at various times different
constituencies. Of his conduct
as member of Parliament, however
his contemporaries might have differed
in opinion, either through partiality
or prejudice, posterity will do
him the justice of according to him a
wonderful versatility of talent, a conscientious
desire to forward the interests
of his country, an unswerving
courage and dignity in meeting the
taunts and sneers of Tory and Whig
alike against his compatriots&mdash;a process
of reasoning then much in vogue
among English politicians. From
Peel, Russell, Disraeli, and Sipthorpe
downwards, no man, among the seven
hundred or so that are supposed to
represent the commons of Great Britain
and Ireland, ever dared to raise
their crest against Catholics or Irishmen,
but, swifter than the flight of a
falcon on a heron, the Liberator
pounced upon him, and, metaphorically,
tore him to pieces. In the
debates on the Reform Bill, the Poor
Law Act, and the tithe question, he
was generally found on the side of
popular rights and free government;
and if, as has been charged, he sometimes
leaned towards the Whigs, it
was because he accepted their measures
as the lesser evils.</p>

<h3>GRAPES AND THORNS.</h3>


<p class="center">BY THE AUTHOR OF "THE HOUSE OF YORKE."
</p>


<h4>CHAPTER VI.<br />

MARRIAGE BELLS.</h4>

<p>That green and sequestered domain
which Mr. Schöninger had
looked at across the water-lilies and
peopled with his fancies, which, indeed,
he had visited, and was perfectly
familiar with, was not so far
out of the world as it appeared. It
was in a great triangle made by three
railroads, and there was a station-house
a mile back from the pond by
which the tenants of the cottage held
easy communication with the two
cities near. Still, the place was not
very accessible from without; for
this mile of country road had been
made by simply driving over pasture
and field, and through alder-woods,
till a track was visible, and then continuing
to drive in the same track.
After coming through the alder-swamp,
the road became two yellow-brown
lines across the greensward,
and ended in a grove that completely
hid the barn built in it. Between
these two yellow-brown lines, at regular
distances, were yellow-brown
spots, showing where the horse had
stepped. Dobbin appeared to always
step precisely in his own tracks.</p>

<p>It was seldom that any one drove
over this road except old Mr. Grey,
whose horse and wagon were, after
their kind, quite as old as himself.
Mrs. Macon, zealously collecting useful
articles for the new convent, had
driven there in her light phaeton,
and spent two hours rummaging the
attics with Mrs. Grey, and talking
over the relics they found; that is,
Mrs. Grey explained, and her visitor
listened. She had gone away with
bundles piled up to her chin.</p>

<p>One afternoon late in August, Mr.
Grey harnessed Dobbin to the wagon&mdash;"tackled"
Dobbin, he would have
said&mdash;and started for the railroad
station. He had almost reached the
alders, which seemed to bar the way,
when he drew the reins and listened.
If it had been Mrs. Grey, instead of
her husband, she would have driven
straight on, for she was perfectly
deaf.</p>

<p>These alders leaned over, and, in
summer, completely hid the road,
and whatever went through there
had to breast a tide of leaves. It had
never occurred to Mr. Grey to cut
the twigs away, nor, apparently, had
it occurred to Dobbin to fret against
them. They jogged on uncomplainingly,
never in a hurry, and lived and
let live. Mr. Grey's philosophy was
that every person in the world is appointed
to do just so much, and that,
as soon as his work is accomplished,
he dies. He preferred to do his part
in a leisurely manner, and live the
longer.</p>

<p>The sound he listened to was a
faint noise of wheels and hoofs, in, or
beyond, the alders. For two carriages
to meet in that place would
be a predicament more perplexing
than that of the two unwise men and
the two wise goats on the narrow
bridge we have all read of; because
here neither could turn back, nor
walk over the other, and if one should
be killed, still that would not clear
the track. So the driver waited, his
mouth slightly open, to hear the better,
and the lash of his old-fashioned
whip hanging motionless over his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
shoulder. The old white horse dropped
his nose, and went to sleep, and
the creaking and rattling wagon looked
as if it had made its final stand,
and meant to go to pieces where it
was.</p>

<p>There was just sound enough to
show how still it was. Some wild
creature under a rude cage on the
lawn snarled lowly to itself, there
was the swift rustle of a bird's wings
through the air, and the roll of a
train of cars lessened to a bee's hum
by distance. The pond was glassy,
the rails shone hot beyond it; farther
still the sultry woods heaved their
billows of light and shade; and, farthest
of all, over a little scooped-out
valley, a single mountain stood on
the horizon.</p>

<p>There was, indeed, a carriage
among the alders, but by no means
such an equipage as that which awaited
it. It was like a fairy coach in
comparison, with a glitter of varnish
and metal, and snowy-white lining
that shone like satin, and beautiful
horses that pranced from side to side
as they felt the soft, brushing leaves
and twigs against their dainty coats,
and pushing into their very eyes.
The mice on the box wore glossy
hats, and appeared to be very much
disgusted with this trap into which
they had fallen. To the birds overhead
the whole must have looked
like something swimming in a sea of
green leaves.</p>

<p>The fairies in the coach were not
fully visible from any point, but a
clear voice rose presently from the
submerged cushions. "There's a
sufficient road underneath, John," it
said. "Drive where you see the
alder-tops lowest. There are no
roots, if you keep the way. It is
only overleaning branches."</p>

<p>In a few minutes they emerged,
and drew up beside the wagon. Its
occupant did not make the slightest
reply to the bright salutation of the
two ladies. It was not his custom to
salute any one. He merely waited
to see what would be said.</p>

<p>"O Mr. Grey!" says Annette,
"if I had a pair of strong shears, I
would cut a peep-hole, at least,
through that jungle. Did you get
my letter?"</p>

<p>He nodded, with a short "Yes,"
looking with calm scrutiny at the
two young women.</p>

<p>"Well?" continued Miss Ferrier.</p>

<p>"Elizabeth is out on the pond," he
said; "but the old woman will blow
the horn for her. She'll show you
the flowers; and you can have 'em
all. I can put them aboard of any
train you settle on."</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence; for
Mr. Grey had condensed the whole
business into a few words, and there
was really no more to say. Annette
had written him to save all his flowers
for her wedding, and this was his
answer.</p>

<p>"Are you going away?" she asked,
rather needlessly.</p>

<p>"I'm going to meet the next up-train,"
he answered, and began to
tug at his reins, and chirrup at Dobbin.</p>

<p>They left him making great efforts
to get under way again, and drove
noiselessly on.</p>

<p>"What a peculiarly condensed sort
of man he is in his speech!" remarked
Miss Pembroke.</p>

<p>"Condensed!" exclaimed the
other. "His talk reminds me of
some one whose head and limbs have
been cut off. It takes me by surprise,
and leaves me astonished. I
always feel as if something ought to
be done."</p>

<p>So one carriage creaked into the
alders, and the other sparkled up to
the house door.</p>

<p>This door stood open, and within
it sat an old woman, her hands fold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>ed
in her lap, her eyes looking out
over the water. She had a placid
face, and looked refined. A sweet,
faint smile greeted her visitors, and
her voice was sweet, and was very
low, as the voices of some deaf persons
are.</p>

<p>"Elizabeth has gone out on the
water," she said. "I will call her."</p>

<p>"Don't rise!" exclaimed Annette
quickly, preventing her. "I'll get
the horn for you. I know where
everything is here."</p>

<p>The old lady understood the action,
though she had not heard the
words, and sank back into her seat
again.</p>

<p>"She feels for everybody's pain,"
she said gratefully, speaking to herself.</p>

<p>Annette tripped lightly across the
sunny, silent room, and took down
from a nail beside the chimney
a large ox-horn suspended there.
With simple politeness, the old lady
obeyed her visitor's wish, and did not
rise even when the horn was placed
in her hand. She merely leaned
forward, and, placing it to her lips,
blew a loud and prolonged blast
that sounded far over water and
forest.</p>

<p>"That will bring her," she said,
and gave back the rustic instrument
for Annette to return to its place.</p>

<p>The two then strolled down to the
water-side to wait for the lady of the
lake. They seated themselves on a
mossy rock close to the water, under
the shade of the only tree left there.
It was an old pine-tree, of which the
main part was decayed, but one
strong branch made a shade over
them, and held firmly all its dark-green
fasces in token of a sovereignty
it would not abdicate while life
remained. Beside the rock, in the
warm sunshine, stood a group of
Japan lilies.</p>

<p>"I don't like them," Annette said.
"They are beautiful in their way,
but they look cruel and detestable.
They seem to me like a large pink
and white woman who poisons
people."</p>

<p>"My dear," said Miss Pembroke,
as she bent her head over the flowers,
"it would be well if you could contrive
to shut the battery of those
nerves of yours once in a while."</p>

<p>"It might be well if I could be
changed into one like you," Annette
responded; but immediately corrected
herself. "No! And I do not
believe that the most unfortunate
and discontented person in the world
would be willing to change his
individuality with another. It is
only his circumstances he would
change, and be still himself, but at
his best. Perhaps that is what will
keep us contented in heaven, though
we may see others far above us: each
will be himself in perfection, with all
the good in possession that he is
capable of holding, and will see that
he cannot be different without being
some one else."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Honora dreamily.</p>

<p>It may be that she felt unconsciously
a little of that superiority which
the calm assume over the troubled,
though the calm may be of the pool,
and the trouble of the ocean, or both
a mere question of temperament.
She leaned over the lily, and examined
the red clots on its petals; how
they rose higher, and strained upward
toward the centre, till by their
passionate stress they drew up the
milky flower substance into a stem to
support them; as though they would
reach the slender filaments that
towered aloft over their heads. Two
or three tiniest red spiders were
picnicking on the fragrant white
ground among these stems, and did
not seem to even suspect the presence
of a large black spider, with extrava<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>gantly
long legs, which walked directly
over the flower and them in
two or three sextuple strides.</p>

<p>"The petal they stand on must
seem to them a soft and snowy-white
moss," drawled Miss Pembroke,
half asleep with the heat and
the silence. "I should think the
perfume of it would be too strong
for their little noses."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the particles of fragrance
are too large for their little
noses. Or, perhaps, they have no
noses," responded Miss Ferrier,
gravely.</p>

<p>A faint, responsive murmur of assent
from the other.</p>

<p>Annette tossed twigs into the
water, and watched the dimples they
made, and which way they floated.
"That is a wild fox up under that
cage," she said. "It is cruel to keep
it there. I shall free it when we go
back."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Mr. Grey is going to
stuff its skin, and may not like to lose
it," Honora answered, having finished
her examination of the lily. "I have
heard that he is quite a naturalist,
and has specimens of every animal,
and insect, and plant about."</p>

<p>Annette tossed a pebble this time
with energy. "I hate naturalists,"
she remarked. "I always fancy
that they have bugs in their pockets."</p>

<p>"Bugs in their pockets! That
would be uncomfortable," was the
placid comment.</p>

<p>"For the bugs, yes!" said
Annette; then, after a moment,
added, "Whenever it is a question
of tormenting what Lord Erskine
called the 'mute creation,' I am
always for the plaintiff. Who is to
be profited by knowing about bugs
and beetles? It is a contemptible
science, and, I repeat, a cruel one.
I never can like a woman or a man
whom I have once seen sticking
pins through beetles, and butterflies,
and bats; and I would as lief have
a human skull for an ornament in
a room as a stuffed skin of anything.
I shall set that fox free this
instant. I observed it as I came
past, and it looked like a person
going crazy. Its eyes were like fire
and there was froth round its teeth."</p>

<p>Miss Pembroke looked up in
alarm, for Annette had risen. "Do
be careful!" she said. "His bite
would kill you. Don't you remember
that Duke of Richmond who
was bitten by a fox, in Canada, and
died of hydrophobia a day to two
afterwards? He was playing with
it, and it snapped at his hand."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to play with it,
but to free it," said Annette, and
walked rapidly across the green.
"I've found one fault in Honora,"
she muttered. "She is sweet and
good to a certain length, but her
sympathies are circumscribed."</p>

<p>The cage of strong withes was
securely fastened to the ground
with wooden pins, and the door
was tied with a slender chain. The
fox was furthermore secured by a
rope which held one of his legs.
He faced about and glared at his
liberator, while, from the outside,
she cut the rope with her pocket-knife.
His eyes were like balls of
fire, but he did not snap at her.
He did not trust her, but he had
perhaps a doubt that she meant
him well.</p>

<p>The leg free, Annette slipped the
knob of the chain, and opened the
door.</p>

<p>"In honor of the Creator of men
and beasts, and S. Francis of Assisi,
go free now and for ever," she said.</p>

<p>The creature stood motionless one
instant, then, with the rush and
speed of an arrow, it shot through
the opening, flew across the green,
and leaped into the water, that
hissed as though a red-hot coal had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
been dropped into it. Annette ran,
laughing and full of excitement,
back to the rock, and watched the
swimmer. Only his nose and long
tail showing, he made fiercely for
the shore, his whole being concentrated
in the one longing for freedom.</p>

<p>"If he should run into a cage on
the other side, I believe his heart
would burst with the disappointment,"
Annette said, standing up
to watch him. "Bravo! There he
is, my dear brother, the fox."</p>

<p>He leaped up the farther shore
and over the track, and rushed headlong
into the broad, free woods.</p>

<p>"Won't he have a story to
tell!" said Annette, seating herself;
"that is, if he ever stops running.
You may depend on it, Honora, I
shall be a great heroine among the
foxes; and as years go by, and the
story is passed down from generation
to generation, I shall undergo
a change in the picture. My hair
will grow to be golden, with stars
in it, and my eyes will be radiant,
and they will put wings on me, and
I shall be an angel. That's the
way the myths and marvels were
made. But how they will get over
my sawing off the rope with a dull
pen-knife is more than I can tell."</p>

<p>"The spirit will be true, dear,
if not the letter," Honora answered,
smiling. "What signifies a little inaccuracy
in the material part? That
will be turned to dust before the
story reaches the winged period."</p>

<p>Miss Ferrier had something on
her mind which she shrank a little
from speaking of, but presently mentioned
in that careless manner we
assume when we care more than
we like to own:</p>

<p>"I've been wondering lately whether
it would be silly in me to have
my genealogy looked up. It seems a
little top-heavy to have one's family
tree all leaves and no roots, though
mine is not so in reality. My father
and mother were both very poor and
ignorant when I was born; but my
great-grandfather was a French gentleman.
He became poor in some
way, and had no idea how to do
anything for himself. I dare say he
was very weak, but he was immensely
genteel. He and his sons lived
in a tumble-down old stone house
somewhere near Quebec, and ate oatmeal
porridge out of painted china
bowls, with heavy spoons that had a
crest on them. There they moaned
away their existence in a state of resigned
surprise at their circumstances,
and of expectation that the riches
that had taken to themselves wings
would fly back again. There was
one desperate one in the family, and
he was my grandfather. He grew
tired of shabby gentility, and set out
to work. The others cast him off;
and I suppose he wasn't very energetic,
or very lucky, for he went
down. He married a wife from the
working class, and they had no end
of children, who all died sooner or
later, except my father. My grandfather
died, too&mdash;was glad to get himself
out of sight of the sun; and my
poor father&mdash;God be merciful to him!&mdash;stumbled
on through life in the
same dazed way. All he inherited was
the dull astonishment of that old
Frenchman who could never be made
to realize that riches would not some
day come back as they had gone.
Of course"&mdash;Annette shrugged her
shoulders, and laughed slightly&mdash;"it
would be necessary to drop some of
the later details. That is the way
people do. Build a bridge over the
chasm into the shining part. Miss
Pembroke, what do you think of my
unearthing my great-grandfather, and
setting him up in my parlors for
people to admire? Wouldn't it be
more interesting than a stuffed fox?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
I am of his ancestry"&mdash;her laughter
died out in a flash of pride. "If
they had any fire worthy their blood,
I have it. Some spark was held in
abeyance, and I have caught it. I
would like to go back and search
out my kindred. Well! do you
think me vulgar?"</p>

<p>Honora looked at her earnestly.
"No, Annette; but you are condescending
too much. You are coming
nearer to vulgarity than I ever knew
you to before. Lineage is something,
is much, and those who can look
back on a noble and stainless ancestry
are fortunate, if they are worthy
of it. I do not wonder that they are
pleased to remember their forefathers.
But character is more, and does not
need ancestry. It is sufficient to itself.
What, after all, is the real advantage
of belonging to a high family?
It is that one is supposed to
inherit from it high qualities. If one
has the qualities without the family,
it is far higher. It is the kind of
character that founds great families&mdash;that
natural, newly-given loftiness.
I should be sorry if you allowed
yourself to take a step in this matter,
Annette."</p>

<p>"You can easily say all that,"
Annette replied, half pleased and half
bitter. "You have a past that you
can look to with pride."</p>

<p>"With pride!" echoed the other.
"I do not understand you. If you
mean Mrs. Carpenter, I certainly
like to think of her; but her qualities
were entirely personal. I have nothing
to be ashamed of in my family,
and I am thankful for that; but, also,
I am not aware that there is anything
to be proud of. It is a merely negative
feeling."</p>

<p>"But," Annette said, "your people
have always been well off, and some
were very rich, and they were educated."</p>

<p>"And you think me capable of
pluming myself on that&mdash;of being
proud of an ancestry of prosperous
traders and merchants who were passably
educated!"</p>

<p>Honora flushed, and drew herself
up involuntarily, with an awakening
of that invincible personal haughtiness
which is more soaring than any
mere royalty of blood.</p>

<p>"I never give it a thought, except
in a negative way. They merely did
what decent people with ordinary
sense and capacity are obliged to do.
No, Annette, don't fancy that I can
walk on such small stilts. If it were
an old historical name, now, one that
painters had illustrated and poets
sung, that would be fine. If there
had been great warriors and mighty
rulers, there would be a chance for
pride to come in. Or, better, if it
were some hero or benefactor to the
race, whom I could look back to; or
if it were a poet. I always fancy
some grace surrounds the children of
a poet. They may not sing, they
may be personally commonplace;
but, like the broken vase,</p>

<p class="center">"'The scent of the roses will hang round them still.'"
</p>

<p>"I think you must be descended
from a poet," Annette said, smiling.</p>

<p>"And so, child," concluded Honora,
laying her hand on her companion's
arm, "don't condescend to
go into the past for some reason
why you should be respected; find it
in yourself. I think it right to tell
you now what might otherwise sound
like flattery. I, and many better
judges than I, think you uncommon
and admirable. You have made
little mistakes&mdash;as who has not?&mdash;but
they were never mean ones. Don't
be led into pettiness now."</p>

<p>Annette blushed.</p>

<p>"What set me talking of ancestry?"
she exclaimed. "It's a dusty
subject, not fit for this fresh, clear
place. It belongs to the town. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
quiet and lovely it is here! I would
like to come often. In the city, I
can't hear myself think."</p>

<p>They sat a while without saying
anything, and looked over the water.
A shower was travelling across the
distant mountain, trailing in a dim
silver mist from sky to earth. It sailed
nearer, so that drops from the edge of
it dimpled the pond not far away.</p>

<p>A boat came toward them, propelled
by a pair of strong arms. Elizabeth
had heard her grandmother's
summons, and was coming home.
Her little boat was piled full of
boughs of the wild cherry. Strings
of its fruit, like strung garnets, glowed
through the green leaves. With
this was a tangled mass of clematis.
She had hung a long spray of the
vine over her head and neck, and its
silvery-green blossoms glistened in
the loose rings of her short, black
hair, which it pushed over her forehead,
and almost into the laughing
eyes beneath. Through this vine, and
the blouse that covered but did not
hide them, the working of her supple
shoulders could be seen. Her smooth,
oval face was deeply flushed with
health, exercise, and warmth.</p>

<p>She was perfectly business-like in
her manner, and attended strictly to
what she was doing. Even in passing
before the young ladies, and looking
directly in their faces, though
her lips parted in a smile, she made
no other sign of recognition. She
brought her boat round in a smooth
circle, not without pride, apparently,
in displaying her skill, pushed it into
a tiny cove, where the long, trailing
grass brushed both sides, sprang
lightly ashore, and tied it to the
mooring-ring.</p>

<p>Then she made her half-embarrassed
salutation, and stood wiping
away the perspiration that lay in
large drops on her forehead, and in
little beads around her mouth.</p>

<p>If these three young women had
been changed into flowers, the rower
would have been a peony, Honora
a lily, and Annette&mdash;but there is no
flower complex and generous enough
to be her representative. Be her
symbol, rather, the familiar one of the
orb just rounding into shape out of
chaos. She was less well balanced
than Honora, merely because there
was so much more to balance. Her
freak of searching out an ancestry
would never have been acted on,
even if her friend had approved it.
It was one of those thoughts which
need only to be put into words in
order to be dismissed. Annette had
rid herself of a good many foolish
notions in this way, and had been
growing wiser than her critics by the
very acts which they took as proofs
of her weakness.</p>

<p>Miss Pembroke had discovered
this, for she looked lovingly. Others
were astonished to find themselves
awed to-day where they had mocked
but yesterday, and professed that
they knew Annette Ferrier only to
be puzzled by her.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens to people
that illusory thoughts and feelings,
which, pent in the mind, have an appearance
of reality, and even of force,
perish in expressing themselves, as
the cloud breaks in thunder.</p>

<p>There was another difference between
these two: Annette had one
of those souls that are born nailed
to their cross.</p>

<p>It is usual with hasty and superficial
judges, people who, as Liszt
says, "desire to promulgate laws
in spheres to which nature has denied
them entrance," to show what
they fancy is a good-natured contempt
for these discontented beings
who cannot accommodate themselves
to life as it is. They mention them
with an indulgent smile, and seem
to take pleasure in wounding still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
further these sensitive souls, not
aware how clearly they display their
own presumptuous selfishness. The
ease with which they content themselves
with inferior aims and pleasures,
they dignify by the name of
philosophy and good sense; and they
presume to censure those who, tormented
by a vision of perfection, and
feeling within themselves the premature
stirring of powers that can be
employed only in a higher state of
existence, seem so imperfect only because
to be perfect they must be superhumanly
great. There are two ways
in which this divine discontent may
be silenced: the soul may degrade
itself, and treat its ideals as visionary;
or it may find rest in God. But
no ordinary piety suffices; only a
saintly holiness, flowing in and
around the troubled soul like a
sunny and peaceful sea, can lift and
bear it smoothly on to that land
where nothing sacred is mocked at,
and the smiles are awakened by no
sight of another's pain.</p>

<p>Annette Ferrier had made this
much progress, that she had learned
to rely on no one for a sympathy
that would satisfy her, and had
owned to herself that her heart required
other and nobler aims and
motives than those which had occupied
her. She was half aware,
or would have been, if the thought
had not been rejected as treasonable,
that if she were not already engaged
to Lawrence Gerald, nothing would
induce her to accept him as her
future husband. But she had accepted
him, and there was no longer
room to doubt or to choose, or even
to think of doubting or choosing.
It lacked but a week to their wedding-day,
and she was making her
last preparations. What was worth
doing at all was worth doing well,
she thought, and resolved to make
the occasion a festival one.</p>

<p>The three walked up the green
together, Elizabeth between the two
young ladies. Miss Pembroke stepped
quite independently, her hands
folded lightly together; Annette
held by the end of the clematis
wreath that still hung over the young
girl's shoulders, and looked at her
with a caressing smile.</p>

<p>"Did you buy the little writing-case
we were speaking of when I
was here last?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly," was the hesitating
answer.</p>

<p>"Not exactly! That means that
you have engaged it, or got one
that does not suit, and must be exchanged."</p>

<p>Miss Ferrier had dropped the
wreath, and was engaged in gathering
up the cloud of pale blue muslin
that flowed around and behind
her, and did not observe the smile
on the girl's face.</p>

<p>"No," said Elizabeth, gathering
courage from her visitor's kindness.
"You see, when I sat down and
looked at the half-eagle you gave
me, I thought it seemed a pity to
go right off and spend it for a writing-case.
I could have that, if I
wanted to, so I didn't feel quite so
anxious about it; and there were
other things I wanted just as much.
It would be nice to have a little
clock in my room, and five dollars
would buy one. So since I could
have that, too, I felt easier about
not having it. Then, I would like a
larger looking-glass. Well, I kind
of thought I had it, since I could
buy it if I would. And I could get
any one of the half a dozen other
things I wanted, making about ten
in all. But when I knew that I
could have either whenever I chose,
I didn't feel in a hurry to get anything;
and I was so sure of each
one that it seemed to me as if I
had them all. So I just kept the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
five dollars; and while I keep it, it
is as good as fifty to me. When I
spend it, it will be only five dollars,
and I shall want nine things dreadfully,
and be sorry I hadn't bought
one of them instead of what I did
get."</p>

<p>Annette dropped her gathered-up
skirts from her hands to throw her
arms around the young rustic's neck,
and kiss her astonished face.</p>

<p>"You dear little soul!" she cried,
in an ecstasy, "how quickly you have
found it out!"</p>

<p>Elizabeth blushed immensely, for
she was not used to being kissed.
"Found out what?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Why, that nothing in the world
is very desirable except what you
can't get."</p>

<p>"Oh!" The girl tossed her head
back, and laughed ringingly. "I
found that out as long ago as I
used to cry for mince-pie to eat,
and then cry with stomach-ache
after I had eaten it. Grandfather
used to tell me then that if there is
anything in the world that we want
so much we cry to get it, it will
be sure to make us cry still more
after we have it. I never forgot
that. Grandfather knows a great
deal about everything," she concluded,
with an air of conviction.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see a creature
learn so easily?" Annette said to
Honora. "She begins life with all
the wisdom of experience."</p>

<p>Honora sighed as she answered,
"She reminds me of something dear
Mother Chevreuse said the last time
she came to see me: 'Nothing is
worth working for but bread and
heaven.'"</p>

<p>They had reached Mr. Grey's floral
treasure-house by this time, and
the flowers absorbed their attention.</p>

<p>"Bushels of asters!" exclaimed
Annette, pausing outside the door,
and glancing along the garden-beds.
"And they are almost as handsome
as roses. Those will do for the balconies
and out-of-the-way places.
And, Elizabeth, I want you to cherish
every pansy as if it were a jewel.
I don't care about the piebald ones,
but the pure purple or pure gold are
quite the thing. And now, Honora,
step in here, and own that you never
before saw fuchsias. You remember
Edgar Poe's hill of tulips sloping to
the water, like a cataract of gems
flowing down from the sky? That
Poetical creature! Well, here's a
Niagara of lady's ear-drops."</p>

<p>When at length they had started,
and were driving down to their alder-bath
again, Honora leaned out of the
carriage, and looked back.</p>

<p>"What a lovely place this would
be to spend a honeymoon in!" she
said softly, as if to herself.</p>

<p>"Which, yours or mine?" asked
Annette.</p>

<p>Honora blushed. "I was thinking
of honeymoons in the abstract,"
she replied.</p>

<p>Elizabeth stood on the lawn, and
looked after the carriage as long as it
was in sight; and when it was no longer
in sight, she still gazed at the green
wall that had closed up behind it.
Perhaps she was thinking what a fine
thing it must be to drive in a pretty
carriage, and have gauzy dresses
trailing away behind one like clouds;
or may be she was recollecting what
they had said to her, and how that
delicate, airy lady had kissed her on
the cheek, and laughed with tears in
her eyes.</p>

<p>While she gazed, deeply occupied
with whatever dream or thought she
was entertaining, the alders parted
again, and a man appeared, hesitating
whether to come forward, yet looking
at her as if he wished to speak.
Elizabeth did not much like his
looks, but she advanced a step to see
what he wanted. No harm had ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
come to her there, and she had no
thought of fear. Besides, she would
have considered herself perfectly well
able to put this person to flight; for
his slim, little figure and mean face
were by no means calculated to inspire
either fear or respect.</p>

<p>Encouraged by her advance, the
man came forward to meet her.</p>

<p>"My grandfather will soon be
home, if you want him," she said directly,
holding aloof.</p>

<p>The stranger did not want to see
him; he merely wished to ask some
questions about the place which she
could answer.</p>

<p>They were very trivial questions,
but she answered them, keeping her
eyes fixed intently on him. He
wanted to know what they raised
there; if it was very cold in winter;
if it was very hot in summer; if they
had many visitors there; if she was
much acquainted in Crichton; if she
had a piano; if she could play; if
she knew any good music-teacher.
And perhaps she had seen Mr. Schöninger?</p>

<p>No, she had not seen him.</p>

<p>"Oh! perhaps you have met him
without knowing," the man said with
animation, in spite of an assumed
carelessness. "Seems to me I saw
him come here this summer. Don't
you remember a man whose buggy
broke down beyond there, and he
came here for a rope?"</p>

<p>The girl's eyes brightened. "Oh!
is that a music-teacher?" she asked.
"His voice sounds like it, or like
what a music-teacher's ought to be.
Yes, I remember him. He got on
to the wrong road driving up to
Crichton, turned off here instead
of going straight on, and something
broke. I gave him a rope, and he
went away."</p>

<p>"Let me see; there was somebody
else here at the same time, wasn't
there?" he asked, with an air of trying
to recollect. "Wasn't there a
woman here getting things for the
new convent?"</p>

<p>The disagreeable eagerness in her
questioner's eyes chilled the girl; but
there seemed no reason why she
should not answer so insignificant a
question. She did so reluctantly.
"Yes, Mrs. Macon was here."</p>

<p>"And her carriage was standing at
the door?" he added, nodding.</p>

<p>"Seems to me you're very much
interested in our visitors," said Elizabeth
abruptly, drawing herself up a
little.</p>

<p>The man laughed. "Why, yes, in
these two. But I won't ask you
much more. Only tell me one thing.
Did you see this Mr. Schöninger come
up to the door, and go away from it?"</p>

<p>"I saw him come up, I didn't see
him go away," she said.</p>

<p>The truth was that Miss Elizabeth
had admired this stranger exceedingly,
but had not wished him to suspect
it. So instead of frankly looking
after him as he went out, she had
turned away, with an air of immense
indifference, then rushed to the window
to look when she thought him
at a safe distance.</p>

<p>"Then you didn't see him when
he passed by the phaeton that stood
at the step?" pursued the questioner.</p>

<p>She shook her head, and pursed
her lip out impatiently.</p>

<p>"He had a shawl over his arm
when he came. Did you notice
whether he had it when you saw him
going away?" was the next question.</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about it,"
she said shortly; but recollected even
in speaking that she had said to herself
as she watched the strange gentleman
going, "How does he hold
his shawl so that I can't see it?"</p>

<p>"Now, one more question, and I
have done," the stranger said. His
weak, shuffling manner had quite disappeared,
and he was keen and busi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>ness-like.
"Was there anybody else
about the house who saw this man?"</p>

<p>"Yes; grandfather was in the
garden; but he didn't come near
him."</p>

<p>"What part of the garden? In
sight of the door?"</p>

<p>"I won't tell you another word!"
she exclaimed, turning away. "And
I think you'd better go."</p>

<p>When she glanced back again,
the man had disappeared. She felt
uneasy and regretful. Something
was going on which she did not understand,
and it seemed to her that
she had done harm in answering
those questions.</p>

<p>"I wish I had gone into the house
when I saw the prying creature," she
said to herself; "or I wish I had held
my tongue. He's got what he came
for, I can see that."</p>

<p>He had got what he came for, or
very nearly.</p>

<p>"Shall I waylay the old man, and
question him?" he thought; and concluded
not to. "If he knows anything,
he will tell it at the proper
time."</p>

<p>The green boughs brushed him
with their tender leaves, as if they
would have brushed away some cobwebs
from his sight, and opened his
eyes to the peace and charity of the
woods; but he was too much absorbed
in one ignoble pursuit to be accessible
to gentler influences. What he
sought was not to uphold the law;
what he felt was not that charity to
the many which sometimes makes
severity to the few a necessity. His
object was money, and charity lay
dead in his heart with a coin over
each eye.</p>

<p>That evening Miss Ferrier and
Lawrence Gerald talked over their
matrimonial affairs quite freely, and
in the most business-like manner in
the world. They discussed the ceremony,
the guests, the breakfast, and
the toilette, and Annette displayed
her lace dress.</p>

<p>"It is frightfully costly," she
owned; "but I had a purpose in
making it so. I shall never wear it
but once, and some day or other
it will go to trim a priest's surplice.
You see, I ordered the pattern to
that end, as nearly as I could get it,
and not have it made for me. There
was no time for that. The ferns are
neutral; but the wheat is perfect, you
see, and that vine is quite like a
grape-vine. I shall wear a <em>tulle</em> veil."</p>

<p>She threw the cloud of misty lace
over her head.</p>

<p>"Why, Annette, it makes you look
lovely!" Lawrence exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I am glad you think so," she
responded dryly, and took it off
again.</p>

<p>Lawrence was seated on a tabouret
in Annette's own sitting-room, which
no one else was allowed to enter during
these last days of her maiden
life. It had been newly furnished
after her own improved taste, and
the luxury and elegance of everything
pleased him. He was still
more pleased to see her so well in
harmony with it. He was beginning
to find her interesting, especially as
he found her indifferent and a little
commanding toward him.</p>

<p>"And now, Lawrence," she said,
folding carefully the beautiful Alençon
flounce, "you have some little preparation
to make. You know you
must be reconciled to the church."</p>

<p>"I have nothing against the
church," he said coolly.</p>

<p>"The church has something
against you, and it is a serious matter,"
she urged, refusing to smile.
"You haven't been to confession for&mdash;how
many years? Not a few,
certainly. No priest will marry us
till you go."</p>

<p>"I suppose a minister wouldn't
do?" remarked the young man, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
the greatest hardihood, seeming mildly
doubtful about the question.</p>

<p>"Now, Lawrence, don't talk nonsense,"
Annette begged. "When
one is going to be married, one feels
a little sober."</p>

<p>"That's a fact!" he assented, with
rather ungallant emphasis.</p>

<p>She colored faintly. Her gentle
earnestness might have touched one
less careless. "It is beginning a
new life," she said; "and if it were
not well begun, I'm afraid we should
not be happy."</p>

<p>The young man straightened himself
up, and gave his moustache an
energetic twist with both hands&mdash;a
way he had when impatient.</p>

<p>"Well, anything but a lecture,
Ninon," he exclaimed. "I'll think
the matter over, and see if I can
rake up any transgressions. I dare
say there are plenty."</p>

<p>"You will speak to F. Chevreuse
about it?" she asked eagerly.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"And now sing me something," he
said. "I haven't heard you sing for
an age. Is there anything new?"</p>

<p>She seated herself at the exquisite
little piano, well pleased to be asked.
Here was one way in which she
could delight him, for he grew more
and more fond of her singing. Annette's
was a graceful figure at the
piano, and she had the gift of looking
pretty while singing. Her delicate
and expressive face reflected every
light and shade in the songs she
sang, and the music flowed from her
lips with as little effort as a song
from a bird.</p>

<p>"Here is 'The Sea's Answer,'"
she said.</p>

<p>Lawrence settled himself into a
high-backed chair. "Well, let us
hear what the sea answered. Only
it might be more intelligible if one
first knew what the question was,
and who the questioner, and why he
didn't ask somebody else. There!
go on."</p>

<p>Annette sang:</p>

<div class="center">

<span class="i2">Will be brighter than the old.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am stifling for an orbit<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of a wider-sweeping ring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there's laughter in me somewhere,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And I have songs to sing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But life has held me like a vise<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That never, never slips;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when my songs pressed upward,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It smote me on the lips.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And, Sea," she sighed, "I'm weary<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of failure and of strife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I fain would rest for ever,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If this is all of life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy billows rock like mothers' arms<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where babes are hushed to rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sleepers thou dost take in charge<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Are safe within thy breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, if the way be weary,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I have not strength to go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thy rocking bosom, Ocean,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is the tenderest I know."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the sea rose high, and shook her,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As she called upon its name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the life within her wavered,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And went out like a flame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stranger voices read the Word,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And sang the parting hymn,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
<span class="i0">As they dropped her o'er the ship's side<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Into the waters dim.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the rocking ocean drew her down<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Its silent ones among,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all her laughters prisoned,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And all her songs unsung.<br /></span>

<p>There was silence for a little while
when the song ended; then Lawrence
exclaimed, with irritation, "What
sets people out to write such things?
The whole world wants to be cheered
and amused, and yet some writers
seem to take delight in making everything
as gloomy as they are. Why
can't people keep their blues to themselves?"</p>

<p>The singer shrugged her shoulders.
"You mistake, I think. I always
fancy that melancholy writing proves
a gay writer. Don't you know that
school compositions are nearly always
didactic and doleful? When I was
fifteen years old, and as gay as a
lark, I used to write jeremiads at
school, and make myself and all the
girls cry. I enjoyed it. When a
subject is too sore, you don't touch it,
and silence proves more than speech."</p>

<p>Lawrence kept the promise he had
made, though he put its fulfilment
off as long as possible. The morning
before his wedding-day he was at
early Mass, and, when Mass was
over, went into F. Chevreuse's confessional.
It would seem that he had
not succeeded in "raking up" many
transgressions, for ten minutes sufficed
for the first confession he had
made in fifteen years. But when he
came out, his face was very pale, and
he lingered in the church long after
every one else had left. Glancing
in from the sacristy, after his thanksgiving,
F. Chevreuse saw him prostrate
before the altar, with his lips
pressed to the dusty step where
many an humble communicant had
knelt, and heard him repeat lowly,
"<em>Enter not into judgment with thy
servant; for no one living shall be
justified in thy sight</em>."</p>

<p>The priest looked at him a moment
with fatherly love and satisfaction,
then softly withdrew.</p>

<p>The spiritual affairs of her future
husband attended to, toilet, decoration,
ceremony, reception, all planned
and arranged by one brain and one
pair of hands, Annette had still to
school and persuade her mother to a
proper behavior. She, the daughter,
had conquered Crichton. They no
longer laughed at nor criticised her,
and were in a fair way to go to the
opposite extreme, and regard her as
an authority on all subjects. For
the Crichtonians had the merit of believing
that good can come out of
Nazareth, and could become enthusiastic
over what they conceived to
be an original genius victoriously
asserting its independence of a low
origin and of discouraging circumstances.</p>

<p>But the mother was, and ever
would be to them, a subject of
quenchless mirth. Her sayings and
doings, and the mortification she
inflicted on her daughter, were an
endless source of amusement to
them.</p>

<p>"Now, do keep quiet this once,
mamma," Annette begged pathetically.
"You know I shall not be able
to hover about and set people to
rights when they quiz you. You
will have to take care of yourself.
Don't trust anybody, and don't quarrel
with anybody."</p>

<p>For once the mother was disposed
to yield entire obedience. She had
begun to assume that mournful face
which, according to Thackeray, all
women seem to think appropriate at
a wedding; and there was far more
danger of her being inarticulate and
sobbing than of her showing either
pugilism or loquacity.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I sha'n't feel much like
saying anything to anybody when
I see my only daughter getting mar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>ried
before my eyes," she said reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Suppose you saw your only
daughter growing into an old maid
before your eyes, mamma," said Annette,
laughing, and patting her mother
on the shoulder. "Would you
like that any better?"</p>

<p>"Well," Mrs. Ferrier sighed, "I
suppose you may as well be married,
now you've had the fuss of
getting ready. All I care about
is your happiness, though you may
not believe it. I'm no scholar,
and I know people laugh at me;
but that doesn't prevent my having
feelings. You deserve to be happy,
Annette, for you have been a good
child to me, and you were never
ashamed of me, though you have
tried hard to make me like other
folks. I couldn't be anything but
what I am; and when I have tried,
I've only made a greater fool of myself
than I was before. But for all
that, I'm sorry I've been such a
burden to you, and I'm grateful to
you for standing by me."</p>

<p>This was Mrs. Ferrier's first confession
of any sense of her own shortcomings,
or of her daughter's trials
on her account, and it touched Annette
to the heart.</p>

<p>The outside world, that she had
striven to please and win, faded
away and grew distant. Here was
one whom she could depend on, the
only one on earth whom she could
always be sure of. Whatever she
might be, her mother could not be
estranged from her, and could not
have an interest entirely detached
from hers.</p>

<p>"Don't talk of being grateful to
me, mamma," she said tremulously.
"I believe, after all, you were nearer
right than I was; and I have far
more reason to be ashamed of myself
than of you. I have been straining
every nerve to please people
who care nothing for me, and to
reach ends that were nothing when
reached. It isn't worth the trouble.
Still, it is easier to go on than to
turn back, and we may as well take
a little pains to keep what we have
taken much pains to get. I'm sorry
I undertook this miserable business
of a show-wedding. It disgusts me.
A quiet marriage would have been far
better. But since it is undertaken, I
want it to be a success of its kind."</p>

<p>"Oh! as to that," Mrs. Ferrier
said, "I like the wedding. I don't
like to see people get married behind
the door, as if they were ashamed
of themselves. You don't marry
every day, and it may as well be
something uncommon."</p>

<p>They were conversing more gently
and confidentially than they had
for a long time; and the mother
appeared to greater advantage than
ever before, more dignified, more
quiet. Annette pushed a footstool
to the sofa, and, sitting on it, leaned
on her mother's lap.</p>

<p>"Still, I do not like a showy
marriage," she said. "It may do
for two young things who have
parents and friends on both sides to
take all the care, while they dream
away the time, and have nothing to
do or think of but imagine a beautiful
future. For serious, thoughtful
people, I think the less parade and
staring and hurly-burly there is, the
better. But then, that quiet way
throws the two very much alone
together, and obliges them to talk
the matter over; and Lawrence and
I would find it a bore. We are
neither of us very sentimental."</p>

<p>She spoke gently enough, but there
was a faint touch of bitterness in her
voice that the mother's ear detected.</p>

<p>"I don't know why he shouldn't
like to talk the matter over with
you," she began, kindling to anger;
but Annette stopped her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, mamma, there must be an
end put to all this," she said firmly.
"And since there is no other way,
let me tell you the true story of my
engagement. You seem to think
that Lawrence was very anxious to
get me, and that he has made a
good bargain, and ought to be grateful.
Well, perhaps a part of the last
is true; but the first is not. I've got
to humiliate myself to tell you; but
you will never cease to reproach him
unless I do." A burning blush suffused
her face, and she shrank as
if with a physical pain. "Lawrence
knew perfectly well that I liked him
before he ever paid the slightest
attention to me; and when he began
to follow me ever so little, I
encouraged him in a manner that
must have been almost coaxing. He
knew that I was to be had for the
asking. Of course, I wasn't aware of
this, mamma. Girls do such things,
like simpletons, and think nobody
understands them; and perhaps they
do not understand themselves. I
am sure that Lawrence was certain
of me before I had the least idea
what my own feelings were. I knew
I liked him, but I never thought how.
I was too romantic to come down
to realities. Of course, he had a
contempt for me&mdash;he couldn't help
it&mdash;though I didn't deserve it; for
while he thought, I suppose, that I
was trying to win him for my husband,
I was only worshipping him
as superior and beyond all other
men. If girls could only know
how plainly they show their feelings,
or rather, if they would only restrain
and deny their feelings a little, they
would save themselves much contempt
that they deserve, and much
that they do not deserve. So you see,
mamma, Lawrence might at any
time, if you reproach him, turn and
say that I was the one who sought
him, and say what is half true, too.
I didn't mean to, but I did it for all
that. Now, of course, it is different,
and he really wants to marry me.
He is more anxious than I am, indeed.
But the less said about the
whole matter the better. When I
think of it, I could throw myself into
the fire."</p>

<p>"Well, well, dear, don't think about
it, then," the mother urged soothingly,
startled by the passion in Annette's
face. "It doesn't make much
difference who begins, so long as both
are willing. And now, don't torment
yourself any more, child.
You're always breaking your heart
because you have done something
that isn't quite up to your own notions.
And I tell you, Annette, I
wouldn't exchange you for twenty
Honora Pembrokes."</p>

<p>Annette leaned on her mother's
bosom, and resigned herself with a
feeling of sweet rest and comfort to
be petted and caressed, without criticising
either grammar or logic. How
mean and harsh all such criticisms
seemed to her when brought to check
and chill a loving heart!</p>

<p>"Mamma," she whispered, after a
while, "I almost wish that we were
back in the little cabin again. I can
just faintly remember your rocking
me to sleep there, and it seems to me
that I was happier then than ever
since."</p>

<p>"Yes," Mrs. Ferrier sighed, "we
were happier then than we are now;
but we shouldn't be happy to go
back to it. I should feel as if I were
crawling head-foremost into a hole
in the ground. We didn't know how
happy we were then, and we don't
know how happy we are now, I suppose.
So let's make the best of it
all."</p>

<p>The wedding proved to be, as the
bride had desired, a success of its
kind. The day was perfect, no mishap
occurred, and everybody whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
the family had not invited
themselves as spectators. Policemen
were needed to keep the way clear to
the church door when the bridal party
arrived, and the heavens seemed to
rain flowers on them wherever they
went.</p>

<p>Seeing Mr. Gerald bend his handsome
head, and whisper smilingly to
the bride, as they entered the church,
sentimental folks fancied that he was
making some very lover-like speech
suitable to the occasion. But this is
what he said: "Annette, we draw
better than the giraffe. Why hadn't we
thought to charge ten cents a head?"</p>

<p>Her eyes had been fixed on the
lighted altar, just visible, and she did
not look at him as she replied,
"Lawrence, we are in the presence
of God, and this is a sacrament.
Make an act of contrition, or you
will commit a sacrilege."</p>

<p>And then the music of the organ
caught them up, and the rest was
like a dream.</p>

<p>"How touching it is to see a
young girl give herself away with
such perfect confidence," remarked
Mr. Sales, who was much impressed
by the splendor of the bride.</p>

<p>"Give herself away!" growled Dr.
Porson in return. "She is throwing
herself away."</p>

<h3>THE CATHEDRAL OF CHARTRES.</h3>


<p>The story of the erection of the
Cathedral of Chartres is an epic from
beginning to end. Before it arose in
the amplitude and majesty which the
great epoch of Christian art knew how
to bestow upon its works, nothing
less was required than the greatest
courage, the most indomitable perseverance,
and a determination of will
which no difficulties or reverses could
turn from its purpose. The building
of this cathedral was a struggle
against fire and sword, against barbarians
and the elements&mdash;a long
conflict, which in the end left piety
and devotion victorious.</p>

<p>No sooner was the era of persecution
closed by the conversion of Constantine,
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 312, than a church was
raised over the Druidic grotto, and
thronged incessantly by the multitudes
of pilgrims who came to venerate
the sacred image. The wood
covering the hill, no longer possessing,
as formerly, any sacred character,
was cut down, in order that the
town might extend itself in that direction;
and houses began forthwith
to cluster round the foot of the temple,
as if seeking the immediate protection
of Mary.</p>

<p>Of this earliest structure it is impossible
to give any description, as
no account of it remains. It was in
all probability a basilica resembling
others of the period, built with much
less splendor than solidity, and existed
through several centuries until the
year 850. Charles the Bald was
then on the throne, and Frothold
was Bishop of Chartres, being the
forty-second prelate of that see. The
times were very troubled. Charlemagne
had years before gone to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
glorious repose, leaving to his degenerate
successors a sceptre too heavy
for their feeble arms to wield&mdash;a vast
empire without cohesion, and which,
lacking the firm hand of a sagacious
ruler, was already torn with dissensions.
The incursions of the Northmen,
invariably accompanied by fire
and carnage, were continual upon
the hapless kingdom of the Franks.
Hasting, the Danish chieftain, laid
siege to Chartres, which was at this
epoch surrounded with strong and
solid walls, and held out courageously,
well knowing its fate should it fall
into the hands of the barbarians.
After spending some time in ineffectual
endeavors to effect a breach, the
wily Northman had recourse to craft,
causing the bishop to be informed
that he was ready, with all his followers,
to accept the Christian faith,
and humbly requesting admittance
into the city. Scarcely had he entered,
when he threw aside the mask;
the bishop and most of the inhabitants
were massacred, the church destroyed,
and the city given up to the
flames. This exploit was no sooner
performed than rewarded as it deserved.
Before the savage invaders
had time to hasten back, laden with
plunder, to their vessels, the Franks
of the surrounding country fell upon
them and slew them without quarter.</p>

<p>Soon the church and the city arose
again from their ashes. The new sanctuary
was but an humble erection.
The people gave to God the best they
could, but they were impoverished,
and in that age of iron the arts had
sunk to the lowest condition; moreover,
another century had not elapsed
before a similar disaster seemed
about to befall the building.</p>

<p>In those barbarous ages, the sacking
and burning of towns and the
slaughter of their inhabitants were
events always possible, often impending.
In the year 911, Chartres was
besieged by the fierce Norman chieftain,
Rollo, at the head of a formidable
army provided with powerful engines
of war. The Dukes of France
and Burgundy, with the Count of
Poitiers, hastening to the succor of
the city, gave battle outside its walls;
but they were hard pressed, and to
the anxious watchers on the ramparts
seemed likely to be overborne by the
foe. The bishop, Ganthelm or Gancelin,
was not only a warrior in time
of need, but was also full of devotion
to Mary. In the heat of the combat,
he put himself at the head of the
Chartrians, taking with him the reliquary
containing the greatest treasure
of his church&mdash;the sacred tunic of
Our Lady&mdash;and fell upon the invaders.
This vigorous sortie was so
successful that the Northmen were
utterly defeated and with so great a
slaughter that, according to the account
of the monk Paul, the river
was choked with their corpses.</p>

<p>The holy tunic just mentioned
had been given to Charlemagne by
the Emperor Nicephorus and the
Empress Irene, who previously kept
it at Constantinople, whither it had
been brought from Ephesus in the
year 460, in the reign of the Emperor
Leo. Charlemagne, who meditated
an Empire of the West, of which the
capital should be Aix-la-Chapelle,
had at first placed the relic in that
city. His successors, being unable
to carry out his designs, nevertheless
recognized the importance of preserving
so great a treasure to France,
and Charles the Bald, removing it
from Aix, presented it to the church
of Chartres. The history of this
double translation may be seen portrayed
in the great window of the
chapel of S. John Baptist; the archives
of the cathedral and the <cite>Poem
of the Miracles</cite> agreeing with these representations
in their account of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
facts, with regard to which the poet
Maître Nicolas Gilles, writes:</p>

<div class="center">

</div></div>
</div>

<p>But the effects of protection from
on high are not such as to permit a
people and its rulers to do evil with
impunity. Some time afterwards, Thibault
<i lang="fr">le Tricheur</i>&mdash;<em>i.e.</em> the "sharper"
or "cheat"&mdash;<i lang="fr">ce chevalier fel et enginous</i>&mdash;"this
dangerous and deep-skilled
knight," as he is called in the chronicles
of the time, who by some unknown
means obtained possession of
the county of Chartres, made an expedition
against the town of Evreux,
which he took by stratagem, and, going
on from thence as far as Rouen,
so utterly devastated the country
that, in all the land through which he
had passed, "there was not heard so
much as the bark of a dog." During
his absence, the Normans and
Danes together laid siege to Chartres,
which they took by assault, and
again burnt the town, together with
the church. Thibault, returning to
find his son slain and his town in
ruins, went mad with anger and
grief.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the IXth
century was a period of great calamities
and sinister predictions.
There was a general spirit of discouragement
and gloom. Men said
that the end of the world was approaching,
for the year one thousand
was close at hand. They built no
more churches; for to what purpose
would it be? Still, Our Lady must
not surely be left without her sanctuary
at Chartres, nor could the people
themselves dispense with it; they set
to work, therefore, and the destroyed
building was speedily replaced by a
new one; yet, as they had no hope of
its long continuance, wood had a
larger place in its construction than
stone. A few years later, however,
when the unchecked course of time
had belied the prophecies of popular
credulity, it seemed as if Heaven
itself willed to teach the Chartrians
that God and their blessed Patroness
must be more worthily honored; for
in the year 1020, under the episcopate
of Fulbert, on the Feast of the
Assumption according to some, on
Christmas Day according to others,
the church was struck by lightning,
and wholly consumed.</p>

<p>Bp. Fulbert was a holy man, and
also a man of intelligence and courage.
He felt that God had given
him a mission. Amid the smoking
ruins of his episcopal church, he laid
the foundations of a noble structure
which should be fitted to brave the
injuries of time, and not be liable,
like the former ones, to the danger
of conflagration. In order to carry
out his design, Fulbert needed treasure.
He at once devoted all his
own fortune to the work, and then
appealed to his clergy, who imposed
on themselves great sacrifices to satisfy
their generosity; the people of
his diocese also aiding eagerly with
their contributions. Not satisfied
with all this, he addressed himself
to the princes and nobles of France,
and especially to King Robert, who
has been called the father of religious
architecture, and who could
not fail to take a lively interest in the
erection of a sanctuary to Our Lady
of France. The princes of the whole
Christian world were in like manner
invited to assist in the undertaking,
and the King of Denmark in particular
signalized himself by his munificence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>Gifts arriving from all parts, Fulbert
was enabled to commence the
works, as he had desired, on very
large proportions, and to push them
forward with so much activity that
in less than two years the crypt was
finished&mdash;this crypt which is probably
the largest and finest in the world,
and which is still admired as a marvel
of the architecture of the XIth
century. This sanctuary of <i lang="fr">Notre
Dame de Dessoubs-terre</i>, or "Our
Lady of Underground," more worthy
than any which had preceded it
of the Druidic Virgin, was then
opened to receive, through long centuries,
successive generations of the
faithful. Nevertheless, this was but
the root of the majestic tree which
was to rise and expand above this
favored spot. Fulbert devoted the
remaining years of his life to the
work, so that when he died, in 1029,
it had made great progress; and, being
continued with equal energy by
Thierry, his successor, was considered
sufficiently advanced to be consecrated
in 1037, although still requiring
much for its completion.</p>

<p>After the death of Thierry came a
period of marked relaxation in activity.
Several bishops in succession
made no progress in the erection.
S. Yves, one of the most illustrious
prelates who ever filled the episcopal
throne of Chartres, confined himself
principally to the interior adornment
of the cathedral. Munificent
gifts from Maude, Queen of England,
enabled him to replace the ancient
and already dilapidated roof by one
of lead. A new impetus being given
to the undertaking, in 1115 were
laid the foundation of the two spires,
so remarkable and so well known to
the world. In 1145, the works were
in full activity, and it was wonderful,
observes Haymond, Abbot of S.
Pierre sur Dive, to see with what
ardor, perseverance, and piety the
people set to work to bring about
the completion of their church.
"What a marvellous spectacle!" he
writes. "There one sees powerful
men, proud of their birth and of
their wealth, accustomed to a life of
ease and pleasure, harnessing themselves
to the shafts of a cart, and
dragging along stones, lime, wood,
and all the materials necessary for
the construction of the sacred edifice.
Sometimes it befalls that as many as
a thousand persons, men and women,
are harnessed to the same wagon,
so heavy is the load; and yet
so great a silence prevails that there
is not heard the faintest murmur."</p>

<p>It was chiefly during the summer
season that these labors were carried
on. At night, tapers were lighted
and set on the wagons, while the
workers watched around the church,
singing hymns and canticles. Thus
it was at Chartres that the custom,
afterwards so prevalent, began of the
laborers assembling together to pass
the night as well as the day near the
building in course of erection.</p>

<p>The old spire being at last completed,
and the new one reaching
to the height of the roofs, in 1194
another fire broke out, the cause of
which was unknown. It had seemed
as if a strange fatality pursued the
pious undertaking, were not every
event providentially permitted or
arranged. The faithful of those days
so understood this fresh catastrophe,
acknowledging that it was the chastisement
of Heaven for those sins
from which, in spite of their zeal, the
toilers in this work had not always kept
themselves free. It is easy to comprehend
that, notwithstanding all precautions,
these large and prolonged
assemblages could not have been
without great dangers. Some considered
the disaster as a manifestation
of the divine will that the work was
not carried on to a sufficient degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
of perfection; while others again regarded
it as an effect of the jealous
hatred of the arch-enemy, and, according
to the historian Mezeray,
declared that demons, under the
form of ravens, had been seen flying
over the cathedral, with red-hot embers
in their beaks, which they let
fall upon the sacred edifice. This
time the destruction was immense.
Nothing was saved but the crypt
and the two spires, with the connecting
masonry forming the western portal.
The latter, not having as yet
been joined to the main building,
were unharmed by the flames.</p>

<p>Historians of the XVIth century
and later do not mention this fire,
and suppose the edifice which at
present exists to be almost entirely
the work commenced by Bp. Fulbert&mdash;an
error only to be accounted for
by the most complete ignorance of
the laws of ecclesiastical architecture.
Contemporary writers, as, for instance,
William le Breton and Rigord,
monk of S. Denis, as well as
Robert of Auxerre, who adds that
a portion of the town was also consumed,
are unanimous as to the date
and principal particulars of the disaster.</p>

<p>Melchior, the legate of Pope Celestine
III., was at Chartres at the
time of its occurrence, and it was he
who revived and sustained the spirit
of the people, overwhelmed as they
were at first by their calamity. Assembling
them around the ruins of
their church, he did his utmost to
console and cheer them, winning
from them the promise to raise a
cathedral which should not have its
equal in the world, and which should
be built entirely of stone, so as to
render its destruction by fire impossible.</p>

<p>The impulse was easily given. At
the conclusion of the legate's stirring
address, the bishop, Regnault de
Mouçon, and all the canons of the
cathedral, gave up their revenues for
the space of three years towards the
expenses of the building, as may be
seen in the <cite>Poème des Miracles</cite> of
Jehan le Marchant; Philip Augustus
adding his offerings to those of
the clergy with a royal liberality.
The towns-people, also, considering
that their misfortune was not so great
by far as it might have been, seeing
that the reliquary containing the
sacred tunic of Our Lady was
saved, thanks to the devotion of certain
courageous men, who bore it
from the burning church into a place
of safety, felt bound to show their
gratitude by depriving themselves of
part of their possessions in favor of
the work.</p>

<p>A powerful and irresistible current
of devotion seemed in those days to
carry along with it the hearts of men;
and the enthusiasm of the Crusades
having been chilled by reverses, the
religious sentiment of the people
found its outlet in another channel&mdash;raising
sanctuaries of which the magnificence
should be a marvel to succeeding
ages.</p>

<p>Moreover, it must not be forgotten
that, in those ages of faith and fervor,
the fabulous sums which would be
required in our days for similar
erections were not necessary, even
taking into account all proportions
with regard to the respective value
of money. The time had not then
arrived for none but master-masons,
working for ready money only, and
of that a free supply; they who had
nothing but their strength and good-will
cheerfully gave the alms of their
toil, thus sharing equally with the
rich and great in forwarding the
enterprise. Everywhere architects
arose, ready to translate into stone
the religious thoughts and aspirations
of the time, which was not a period
of popular enthusiasm only, but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
in which Christian art was rapidly
expanding into its most remarkable
development, and replacing the heavy
and massive edifices of the Romano-Byzantine
style by those possessing
a boldness, freedom, and splendid
gracefulness hitherto unknown.</p>

<p>Where was found the marvellous
genius capable of conceiving and
executing the plan of the Cathedral
of Chartres?&mdash;this man who, careless
of human fame, and careful only to
work for God, has left no record of
his name, and is called by Jehan le
Marchant simply <i lang="fr">li mestre de l'œuvre</i>.</p>

<p>The "master of the work" for
three years wrought with incredible
ardor. The idea had sprung from
his mind complete, and he longed to
see it realized in its colossal harmony.
It is only in the crypt, in the
old spire, and in the western portal,
spared by the fire of 1194, that the
ancient style is to be recognized;
everywhere else the art of the XIIIth
century triumphs, and we behold the
poem of stone as it was hewn out in
the first purity of its beauty.</p>

<p>At the end of three years resources
failed, and the work could not go on.
"Then," says the poet Jehan, with
all the simplicity of a mediæval
chronicler&mdash;"then the Holy Virgin
prayed her divine Son to work fresh
miracles in her Cathedral of Chartres,
in order that the increase of alms
and offerings might be such as to
secure its completion:"</p>

<p>Miracles, which in this place had
at all times been numerous and remarkable,
and which we might cite
by thousands, are said to have now
greatly multiplied. Those which at
that period excited the enthusiasm
and gratitude of the people to the
highest degree were the cures of a
terrible malady very common in the
middle ages, and known by the
name of the "burning sickness."
The unfortunate persons who were
attacked by it, besides being consumed
by fever, suffered internally as if
from torture by fire, while outwardly
their bodies were covered with frightful
ulcers, of which the pain was intolerable.
The victims of this malady
came from all parts for relief and
healing to Our Lady of Chartres.
According to Jehan le Marchant and
other contemporary writers, the disease
never failed to disappear, either
during or immediately after the <em>novena</em>
which it was customary for each
sufferer to make in the church.</p>

<p>This increase of favors revived
the ardor of the faithful. Gifts and
thank-offerings were made in great
abundance, and the building of the
church went on, with what vigor may
be gathered from the fact that, in little
more than twenty years afterwards,
the cathedral was built and covered
with what William le Breton calls its
<i lang="fr">merveilleuse et miraculeuse</i> roof of
stone. It is in the year 1220 that
he writes: "Entirely rebuilt anew in
hewn stone, and completed by a
vaulted roof like the shell of a tortoise,
the cathedral has no more to
fear from fire before the day of judgment."</p>

<p>The new tower received a spire like
that of the old, excepting that it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>constructed of wood and lead, and
destined to perish in the very partial
fire of 1506, to be replaced by the
beautiful and delicately sculptured
steeple of the XVIth century, still so
greatly admired. The porches were
finished,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> as well as the sculptures, in
their finest details, and the windows
put in. On the 17th of October, in
the year 1260, the edifice was complete,
and on this occasion the Bishop
of Chartres, Pierre de Maincy,
seventy-fifth successor of S. Aventine,
solemnly consecrated his cathedral,
in presence of the king, S. Louis.</p>

<p>Description, however picturesque,
is utterly inadequate to convey a
worthy image or idea of a Gothic
cathedral in all the mysterious fulness,
richness, and variety of its details.
Chartres must be seen, must
have received many quiet hours of
contemplation, before its magnificences
will have shown to what
heights Christian art was raised by
Christian devotion in those early centuries
of enthusiasm and of faith.</p>

<p>And yet we cannot leave the reader
at the threshold without inviting
him to glance with us rapidly, and
therefore most imperfectly, within.</p>

<p>How grand is the perspective which
opens upon the view, when, looking
from the "Royal Gate" towards
the sanctuary, the eye takes in this
triple nave, with its forest of pillars,
amongst which fall, in rich and softened
splendor, warm rays of light and
color from the higher windows! All
the dimensions are on a scale of
grandeur. In its elevation, the cathedral
is divided into three parts, the
idea of the Blessed Trinity ruling this
arrangement. The arcades, springing
from the ground, form the first line,
under the triforium, which forms the
second, while above this rises the
third height, containing the clerestory
windows, which are lofty, double
lancets, each surmounted by a rose.
The lower walls are pierced by simple
lancets of very large size. To the
right and left of the nave are aisles
without side chapels; but in the
double aisle which is carried round
the choir are seven apsidal chapels,
of which the centre one, dedicated to
Our Lady, is the most important.
The pillars of the nave are massive in
their proportions, to bear the weight
of the lofty superstructure. There
are sixteen circular or octagon pillars
round the choir, with well-sculptured
capitals; and in the centre of the
transept rise four colossal pillars,
around which cluster a number of
smaller ones, which are carried up to
the spring of the roof. The latter
was the most beautiful in the world,
and was called <em>the Forest</em>, being
constructed of fine chestnut-wood,
which time colors with a sort of
golden hue, and which attracts
neither dust nor spiders. The roof
of St. Stephen's Hall at Westminster
gives a good idea of what this must
have been, with its exquisite fan
tracery and graceful pendants, until,
on the fourth of June, 1836, the
whole was destroyed by fire. The
iron roof by which it has been replaced,
though excellent in its kind, is
far from approaching the worth and
beauty of the ancient <em>Forêt</em>.</p>

<p>The church is paved throughout
with large slabs of stone, not one of
which is a <em>grave</em>-stone, as would be
the case in almost every other cathedral,
under the pavement of which
are buried numbers of ecclesiastics
and other persons; but this is virgin
earth, wherein no sepulture has ever
taken place. We give the reason in
the words of Sebastian Rouillard:
"The said church has this pre-eminence
as being the couch or resting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>-place
of the Blessed Virgin, and in
token thereof has been even until this
day preserved pure, clean, and entire,
without having ever been dug or
opened for any burial."</p>

<p>The choir is the largest in France,
and one of the most splendid in existence,
notwithstanding the unfortunate
zeal of the chapter in the year
1703 to alter and disfigure its mediæval
beauties according to their own
ideas, which appear to have been
warped to the lowest degeneracy of
"Renaissance." Happily, however,
the prodigious expense to which they
put themselves resulted in but a partial
realization of their plan, in which
ancient carving and mural frescos
were swept away to give place to
gilding and stucco, marble and new
paint, to say nothing of kicking
cherubs and arabesques gone mad.
It was at this time that the groups
representing the annunciation of Our
Lady and Our Saviour's baptism
were placed at the entrance of the
choir, which, even if they were
the work of a more skilful hand, instead
of being that of a very mediocre
artist, would yet be out of harmony
with the church; and the same
may be said of the group, in Carrara
marble, of the Assumption, which
rises behind the high altar, and which
is the work of the celebrated Bridan,
who finished it in 1773.</p>

<p>When, two centuries before, the
choir was still without enclosure, the
XVIth century provided for it one
of the rarest specimens of late Gothic
art ever seen. Jehan de Beauce, who
had been charged with the building
of the new spire, was chosen to make
the designs and direct the work; and
though he died whilst it was still unfinished,
his plan was carefully carried
to its completion. In this marvel
of conscientious labor there are
forty groups, each containing numerous
figures, nearly the size of nature,
representing the Legend of Mary and
the principal events in the life of Our
Lord. Around these groups cluster
pillars and arches, turrets, crocketed
spires, everything that can help to
give them, as it were, a framing and
background as full and elaborate as
possible, while all sorts of odd and
Lilliputian creatures are playing in
and out of the pediments, or clinging
to the columns in the most capricious
and fantastic manner. Besides these
forty principal subjects, the enclosure
is further enriched with thirty-five
medallions, the first of which represents
the siege of Chartres by Rollo,
followed by subjects from the Holy
Scriptures, and then, strange to say,
by others taken from heathen mythology!
The pagan spirit of the Renaissance
was already daring to invade
the sanctuaries of the Catholic
faith.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to mention other
architectural details, two of the especial
treasures of the cathedral require
some further notice. Besides
the Druidic Virgin, of which we have
already given the history, and whose
chapel has, since the Revolution,
been carefully restored, as well as the
twelve other subterranean chapels of
this marvellous crypt, there is in the
upper church another statue, almost
equally venerated, which dates from
the first years of the XVIth century,
and is called "Our Lady of the
Pillar," from the columnar pedestal
on which it rests. This figure is
enthroned, and adorned with gold
and painting of good execution, as
far as may be seen under the abundant
vestments of lace, silk, and gold
with which the loving piety of pilgrims,
greater in devotion than good
taste, delights to load this statue, of
which the dark but beautiful face
has an expression of great sweetness
and benignity, as well as that of the
divine Child, whose right hand is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
raised in benediction, while his left
rests upon the globe of the world.</p>

<p>It was to this venerable image of
<i lang="fr">Notre Dame du Pilier</i> that the Sovereign
Pontiff, Pius IX., granted the
signal favor of a solemn coronation,
which took place on the last day of
the month of May, 1855, in the presence
of seven prelates and a concourse
of clergy and people so immense
that the church could not
contain the multitudes. The dogma
of the Immaculate Conception had
just been promulgated, and a special
jubilee in honor of Our Lady of
Chartres had been granted by the
Holy Father, and the whole city
was in a state of indescribable joy.</p>

<p>With regard to the vestment of
Our Blessed Lady, to which allusion
has so frequently been made, and
which appears to be of indisputable
authenticity, we will give the remainder
of its history up to the present
time. When this was presented
to the cathedral by Charles the
Bald, it was enclosed in a chest of
cedar-wood covered with gold. The
veneration with which the precious
relic was regarded did not allow of
the chest being opened without necessity,
and its form was naturally
supposed to be that of a tunic or
undergarment. Numbers were made
after the imaginary pattern, and, after
being laid upon the reliquary, were
greatly valued as pledges of Our
Lady's protection, especially by those
about to become mothers. As to
one detail, however, everybody was
mistaken, the vestment not being by
any means of the form supposed.
This was for the first time discovered
in 1712, when, by order of the
bishop, Mgr. de Merinville, the coffer,
which was falling to pieces from
extreme age, was opened with the
most extraordinary care and precautions.
A kind of gauze, embroidered
with silk and gold, enveloped the
sacred relic, which proved to be a
veil of great length, woven of linen
and silk. It was then, in presence
of Mgr. de Merinville and other witnesses,
enclosed in a chest of silver,
and placed again in the ancient reliquary,
which had been strengthened
and repaired. This, being most richly
ornamented with precious stones,
was, in December, 1793, carried off
by the men of the Revolution, who
took the relic to Paris, and submitted
it to be examined by the members
of the Institute, without giving them
any information respecting it, and
anticipating from their verdict a triumphant
proof of its being nothing
more than a cheat and deception of
"the priests." It was with less satisfaction,
therefore, than surprise that
they were informed by the learned
members that, "although they found
it impossible to give the exact age
of the fabric, it was evidently of very
great antiquity, and the material was
identical with that of the long, folding
veils anciently <em>worn by women
in the East</em>." Owing merely to this
character of remote antiquity, it was
allowed a place among the curiosities
of a museum. When the Reign
of Terror was over, certain pious persons
obtained possession of it, but
had the want of judgment to divide
it, giving larger or smaller portions
to different churches and individuals.
In 1820, Mgr. de Lubersac succeeded
in collecting several of these portions,
and, after having had them carefully
authenticated, he placed them in a
reliquary of coral, which has since,
by Mgr. Clausel de Montals, been
replaced by one of greater richness,
so arranged as to allow the precious
relic to be visible.</p>

<p>We must, before taking leave of
the cathedral, bestow at least a passing
glance upon its glorious windows.
Here and there one has been broken
by revolutionary or other anti-reli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>gionists,
one or two others have had
a deep-toned color clumsily replaced
by one of brighter hue by certain
of the aforesaid XVIIIth century
canons, who required more light to
read their office; but, on the whole,
they are in admirable preservation.
We can linger but to read some few
of the characters of this vast book of
light, which is justly called by the
Council of Arras "The Bible of the
laity"; for months would be insufficient
to decipher its glowing pages.</p>

<p>There are one hundred and thirty-five
large windows, three immense
roses, thirty-five roses of a middle
size, and twelve small ones. These
are almost all of the date of the
XIIIth century, and are the gifts of
kings, nobles, ecclesiastics, burgesses,
and workmen of every trade, as may
be seen in each window, which usually
contains a kneeling figure of the
donor. The great roses are marvellous
in their splendor. That of the
north transept, which, from being
the gift of S. Louis, is called the Rose
of France, represents the glorification
of the Blessed Virgin, who occupies
the centre, bearing in her arms
her divine Son. The five great
windows beneath the rose make the
complement of the subject. In the
centre is S. Anne, with Our Lady as
an infant. On the right and left
stand Melchisedech and Aaron, types
of our Lord's priesthood; David and
Solomon, the types of his royalty.</p>

<p>The southern rose was given by
the Count of Dreux, and has for its
subject the glorification of our Lord,
which is also that of the sculpture
over the western entrance. In the
centre window of the five below is
the infant Saviour in the arms of his
Mother, while to the right and left
are the four greater prophets, bearing
on their shoulders the four Evangelists,
to symbolize the support
which the New Law receives from
the Old. The western rose represents
the Last Judgment. The three
splendid windows beneath it are
more ancient than the rest, and are
said by those who are learned in
stained glass to date from the XIIth
century at the latest. One of these
is the far-famed "Jesse Window," in
which the tree of Jesse bears among
the verdure of its branches the royal
ancestors of Our Lord; the second
represents scenes from his life, and
the third those of his passion and
death; while above appears the resplendent
figure of Mary, known by
the name of <i lang="fr">Notre Dame de la Belle
Verriere</i>, and justly celebrated for its
admirable beauty. In the seven
great windows of the apse, Mary is
still the centre. In those of the
choir occur amongst others the
figures of S. Louis, S. Ferdinand of
Castile, Amaury IV., Count of Montfort,
and Simon de Montfort, his
brother. The lower windows are
filled with scenes from the Holy
Bible and the <em>Golden Legend</em>, and
contain a great number of figures of
small size, while the higher ones are
principally occupied by grand and
separate figures of prophets, apostles,
and saints.</p>

<p>Standing in the middle of the transept,
one sees the extremities darkened
by the great masses of the
porches, but above them shine the
great roses, whose rainbow hues play
upon the entrance of the choir; the
aisles and chapels are softened by
that sort of half-luminous obscurity
in which we find ourselves on entering
the church; but the shadows flee
more and more before the light,
which, ever increasing, streams down
in torrents as we approach the centre
of the cross, making the sanctuary
resplendent with emerald and ruby
rays. And this marvellous picture
has ever-changing aspects, beauties
ever new, according to the hour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
the day, the brightness of the sun,
and the season of the year. Reader,
when <i lang="la">in propriâ personâ</i> you make
your pilgrimage to Notre Dame de
Chartres, you will feel how poor and
how inadequate has our description
been, and, with the Presence that is
ever there, will own that it is heaven
in all but the locality.</p>

<p>We will conclude our sketch with
a few historical notices of interest,
without which it would be incomplete.</p>

<p>Although we have lived to see occasionally
something approaching to
a renewal of the ancient throngs of
pilgrims, and notably so on the last
27th-30th of May, when a multitude
of more than sixty thousand
persons, including twelve prelates,
besides six hundred other ecclesiastics,
two generals, one hundred and
fifty officers, and one hundred and
forty members of the National Assembly,
went from Paris and various
parts of France on a pilgrimage to
Chartres, still this does not recall
the continuous concourse of former
days, when it often happened that
the town was not large enough to
contain the crowds of strangers, so
that on the eve of certain festivals it
was necessary to allow great numbers
of them to remain all night for
shelter in the church itself. The
parvis of the cathedral, which slopes
downwards from the choir to the
western door, rendered easy the
cleansing process which followed in
the early morning, when floods of
water were thrown upon the pavement.</p>

<p>This eager devotion of the common
people has in it something more
touching even than the innumerable
visits of the rich and great to this
chosen shrine. In the course of the
XIIth century, Chartres numbered
among its pilgrims no less than three
popes and five kings of France;
Philip Augustus being accompanied
by his queen, Isabella of Hainault,
who came to ask Our Lady's intercession
that she might have a son.
Whereupon, says William le Breton,
even whilst the queen was making
her prayer, the candles upon the
high altar suddenly lighted of themselves,
as if in token that her request
was granted, and which accordingly
came to pass.</p>

<p>Before the completion of the
church, it had been visited by two
princesses greater for their sanctity
than for their rank&mdash;namely, Blanche
of Castile, the mother of S. Louis,
and the gentle and pious Isabelle,
her sister. They were followed not
long afterwards by the holy monarch
himself, who, on his first visit,
was accompanied by Henry III., of
England, and on his second, in 1260,
was present at the consecration.
Philip the Fair, who attributed his
success at the battle of Mons en
Puelle entirely to the protection of
Mary, came thither to do her homage
by offering the armor he had
worn in the combat; and in like
manner Philip of Valois, after the
victory of Cassel, gave to the church
of Chartres his charger and his arms.
And when the times darkened over
France, and her king, John the
Good, was the prisoner of Edward
III., the latter refused to listen to
the entreaties of the Dauphin and
the Papal legate that he would
grant peace on reasonable terms,
although "the Father of Christendom
had again and again with his
own hand written letters to the
English king, calling on him to
'forbear from the slaughter of souls
redeemed by the Blood of Christ'";
success had made him relentless, and,
leading on his victorious army, he
laid siege to Chartres. We learn
from Froissart, among other chroniclers,
how Our Lady signalized her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
power, not only in saving the city,
but in leading, humble and submissive,
the lion of England to her feet:
"For there befell to the King of England
and all his men a great miracle:
a storm and thunder so great and
horrible came down from heaven on
the English host that it seemed as
if the end of the world were come;
for there fell down stones so great
that they killed men and horses, and
so that even the boldest trembled."<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> ...
"Thereupon the King of England,
leaping down from his saddle,
and stretching out his arms towards
the church of Our Lady at Chartres,
devoutly vowed and promised to her
that he would no longer refuse to
grant peace upon any terms consistent
with his honor." When, therefore,
he entered the city, it was not
as a warrior, but as a pilgrim; for he
repaired at once to the cathedral, in
company with the Prince of Wales,
the Duke of Lancaster, and many
other English knights, and shortly
afterwards signed the Peace of Bretigny.</p>

<p>Charles V., having revived the
glory of the French arms, was not
unmindful of his gratitude to Our
Lady of Chartres, to whom on two
occasions he made a pilgrimage barefoot,
prostrating himself before the
sacred image; "considering," as he
declares in his letters-patent, "the
splendid, great, and notable miracles
which our Lord God works day by
day in the said church," and praying
for the peace and prosperity of
his kingdom.</p>

<p>One other fact connected with the
kings of France ought not to be
omitted&mdash;namely, the sacring of Henri
IV., which, instead of taking place at
Rheims, according to, we believe, invariable
precedent, was, by his own
special desire, solemnized in the
church of Our Lady of France at
Chartres, when he made, as it were,
a second abjuration by thus publicly
declaring himself to be henceforth a
devoted client of the Blessed Virgin.
"Thus," observes the Abbé Hamon,
<em>Curé</em> of S. Sulpice, "Protestantism,
which had flattered itself with the
hope of mounting on the throne of
France, was broken at the feet of
Our Lady of Chartres, where also
paganism had expired before it in
the defeat and subsequent conversion
of Rollo."</p>

<p>Were we to attempt to name the
saints who have gone as pilgrims to
Chartres, from S. Anselm and S.
Thomas à Becket to S. Francis de
Sales, S. Vincent de Paul, M. Olier,
and the Blessed B. Labré, the enumeration
would be endless; and
though it would require, not pages,
but volumes, to recount the favors
obtained by the intercession of the
Blessed Virgin for her city, we cannot
refrain from selecting a few well-authenticated
historical facts in addition
to those already mentioned.</p>

<p>In the year 1137, Louis le Gros,
having great cause of displeasure
against Thibault, Count of Chartres,
resolved to chastise him in a signal
manner, and advanced against his
city, with the resolution to raze it to
the ground. The inhabitants were
in the utmost terror and distress,
knowing their helplessness before the
power of the irritated monarch.
The bishop, Geoffrey de Lieues,
causing the reliquary containing Our
Lady's tunic to be taken from the
church, carried it in procession with
his clergy and people outside the
gates, and advanced to the royal
tent. At this sight, the anger of
the king subsided. He fell on his
knees before the sacred relic, which
he then devoutly followed, entering
alone into the city, not to destroy it,
but to grant it special privileges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>More than four centuries later, in
1568, Chartres was besieged by the
Huguenots under Condé. They
opened a heavy fire against the Porte
Drouaire, above which gate the
Chartrians placed an image of the
Blessed Virgin. This greatly excited
their fury, and their utmost endeavors
were used to shoot it down.
But the sacred image remained untouched,
though every stone near it
was shattered. The rampart was
nevertheless so far weakened as to
be unable longer to stand against
the powerful artillery. A large
breach was opened, towards which
the besiegers crowded, that they
might carry fire and desolation into
the city. But while the defenders
believed that all was lost, the whole
of the population not in arms was
praying in the cathedral. In the
very moment of their success, the
enemy lost courage; the trumpets
sounded a retreat, and the Huguenot
army left the city, never to return.
It was in memory of this signal deliverance
that a chapel was raised
between the Porte Drouaire and the
river Eure, dedicated to "Our Lady
of the Breach," and which, after being
destroyed in 1789, was in 1844
rebuilt.</p>

<p>Whenever Chartres has been
threatened with pestilence or famine
it has been customary for the bishop
and dean of the chapter to bear the
holy tunic in procession from the
cathedral to the Abbey of Josaphat,
in the midst of an immense concourse
of the faithful, kneeling in the dust,
with heads uncovered. Even in our
own time there has been a recurrence
of these expiatory solemnities. The
cholera, which in 1832 made so
many victims in Paris, appeared also
in Chartres, and deaths multiplied in
the city. But no sooner had the
inhabitants, with all the religious
pomp and devotion of ancient days,
borne the venerated relic through
the streets, imploring her succor who
had for ages proved her right to the
title of <i lang="la">Tutela Carnutum</i>, than the
plague was stayed. All the sick
were cured, and two more deaths
only occurred&mdash;the deaths of two
persons who had publicly insulted
the procession on its way. A gold
medal was struck on this occasion,
having the following inscription;
"Voted to Our Lady of Chartres, by
the inhabitants of the city, in gratitude
for the cessation of the cholera
immediately after the solemn procession
celebrated to obtain her powerful
intercession, on Sunday, the 26th
of August, 1832."</p>

<h3>THE SEE OF S. FRANCIS OF SALES.</h3>


<p>The "arrowy Rhone" and Lake
Leman have become in modern literature
the counterparts of the classic
Anio and Nemi of antiquity. Peculiar
memories cluster about their
shores; they have been the intellectual
battle-field of systems, even while
poets and dreamers were seeking to
make a Lethe of their enchanted
waters; and perhaps on no other
northern spot in Europe has God
lavished such beauties of color, of
atmosphere, of outline, and of luxuriant
vegetation. Geneva rivals the
south in its growth of orange, oleander,
and ilex, in its lake of sapphire
hue, its sunsets of intense variety of
color, and its profusion of white
villas, homes of summer luxuriance,
and temples of delightful idleness.
The clearness of the mountain air,
the irregular outlines of the smaller
hills, the view of the Alps beyond&mdash;above
all, that of Mont Blanc&mdash;the
quantity of hardy Alpine flowers, the
dusky, mediæval beauty of the town,
and the unmistakable energy of its
sturdy-looking inhabitants, denote the
northern character of Geneva. The
old Cathedral of S. Peter, where
Calvin's chair is now the greatest curiosity
and almost the greatest ornament
(so bare is the church), and the
new Cathedral of Notre Dame, a building
hardly large enough for the now
numerous Catholic congregation of
Geneva, speak of the change that has
come over the town in the last four
hundred years. The religious phases
that have come and gone in this
small and seemingly insignificant spot
form an epitome of the religious history
of Europe. The age of faith,
the age of fanaticism, the age of
indifferentism, have reigned successively
in Geneva. In the XIIIth
century, as in many an earlier one,
High Mass was sung at S. Peter's,
and monks or canons sat in the
stalls which yet remain in the choir;
in the XVIth, Calvin and Beza sat in
plain black gown, teaching justification
by faith alone, and burning
Michael Servetus for tenets that
disturbed the new "personal infallibility"
of the Reformers; in the
XIXth, Socinianism is the creed of
the "national" church, and Catholics,
Evangelicals, and Anglicans have
each handsome and roomy buildings,
crowded on Sundays, and adorned
with every outward sign of freedom
of worship. Catholics form half the
population of the canton, and nearly
half that of the city itself. There
are few conversions, however, so that
this proportion does not sensibly increase.
Many of the suburbs are
entirely Catholic. The diocese extends
to many Savoyard parishes,
which are, of course, altogether Catholic.
Until the recent outbreak
against perfect liberty of conscience,
when that liberty was to be applied
to the old church, the position of
Catholics, clergy and laity, was comparatively
satisfactory; the bishop
(of whom we shall speak later) was
universally beloved by his people,
respected by his liberal opponents,
feared by his illiberal enemies; the
moderate party in politics, consisting
of the class corresponding to an
aristocracy, and all of them men of
polite bearing and strong religious
(Evangelical) convictions, were always
on the side of Catholics in upholding
their privileges as citizens of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
the state, voters, and freeholders;
the two churches, S. Germain on
"the hill," and Notre Dame on the
plain (among the new hotels and
villas), besides other chapels on the
Savoy side of the lake, and the new
suburb of Plainpalais, were always
crowded, and there were many
schools for rich and poor under religious
teachers. The Sisters of Charity
had a house, to which tradition
pointed as the house of Calvin; and
many English visitors knocked at
their door, to beg to be allowed a
peep into the courtyard, where they
would pluck a blade of grass as a
memento or <em>relic</em>. These have now
been suppressed; the clergy, who
were originally salaried by the state,
have been thrown on their own resources;
the bishop has been sent
beyond the frontier. He is said to
have remarked to the Holy Father,
<i lang="fr">à propos</i> of this measure: "Your
Holiness sent me to Calvin; Calvin
sent me to Voltaire (the bishop's
retreat is Ferney); but I have great
hopes of outliving them both."</p>

<p>Still, we would fain insist upon the
great difference between this mark of
intolerance and the old rules of the
Calvinistic theocracy. The <i lang="fr">Conseil
d'Etat</i> does <em>not</em> represent Calvin and
his personal fanaticism; it speaks
a language of its own, and one
which Calvin himself would be horrified
to listen to&mdash;the language of
state supremacy defying God. If
Calvin were alive, he would no
doubt feel a hearty satisfaction in
burning Mgr. Mermillod; but he
would have as great a relish for the
burning of Prince Bismarck. Calvinism
was at least sincere in its
fanaticism; the Bismarckian animus
is not even that of a fanatic, but of a
<em>cynic</em>. So it is not the spirit of the
pale, nervous reformer of the XVIth
century that is responsible for the
recent outrage against freedom of
conscience at Geneva; but a spirit
more potent, more ambitious, more
grasping, and, above all, more farseeing&mdash;the
spirit of open infidelity
boasting of its material power of
repression.</p>

<p>Of the political attitude of Geneva
we need not speak, further than to
say that its acknowledged neutrality,
and the intellectual culture of its inhabitants,
have given it a new life, and
made of the focus of the only "Reformation"
that had any sincerity or
inherent strength in it a new focus
of peaceful and dignified repose.
From the <i lang="fr">champ clos</i> of Calvinism, it
has become the arena of the world,
especially of diplomacy, and the city
of refuge of all exiles, royalist, Mazzinist,
and social. Among the latter
came one who has contributed to
Geneva's glory&mdash;Byron, the gifted
prodigal, who is among poets as the
"morning star" once was among
angels. We meant, however, to
speak rather of one of Geneva's citizens
than of the historic city itself;
though such are the manifold charms
of the place that only to name it is a
temptation to plunge at once into a
thousand speculations as to its past
and a thousand theories as to its future.</p>

<p>Mgr. Mermillod, the successor of S.
Francis of Sales, is a native of Caronge,
a suburb of Geneva, and was
born of a Catholic family, poor in
the world's goods, and obscure in its
estimation. He has a vivacity rather
French than Genevese, but with a
solid foundation of that more serious
character which distinguishes his
countrymen. As an orator, he is
hardly second to the Bishop of Orléans,
Mgr. Dupanloup; as a lecturer
to pious women on the duties of
womanhood, he is superior to most
ecclesiastics. In the guidance of
souls, the enlightened discrimination
between what is in itself wrong, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
what harmless if done in a proper
spirit, he seems to have inherited the
special gift of S. Francis of Sales in
directing women of good family, living
at court or otherwise, in the
world. His singular prudence and
the graciousness of his manner are
essential helps to him in the prominent
position he holds towards
modern governments, and the daily
contact which confronts him with
modern sentiment. He is the weapon
expressly fashioned for the last new
phase into which the eternal struggle
against the world, the flesh, and the
devil has entered. Like S. Francis,
he wraps his strength in gentleness,
and carries out the <i lang="la">suaviter in modo,
fortiter in re</i>. In conversation, of
which he is fond&mdash;for his is not the
monastic ideal of holiness&mdash;he is
sprightly, witty, and accurate. His
power of crystallizing ideas into a
<em>mot</em> is quite French, and the childlike
joyousness of his demeanor is no less
so. The word ascetic seems to imply
the very antipodes of his nature; and
yet his private apartment, which we
were once privileged to see, is almost
like a cell. Here is a description of it,
gathered from the impressions of two
worthy visitors: "I felt," says one,
"in this little <em>buco</em> (hole) as if I were
in the cell of a saint, and examined
everything with veneration. That little
<i lang="fr">prie-Dieu</i>, so simple in its build, which
daily witnesses the prayers and sighs
of the pastor, anxious for his flock and
the souls entrusted to him by God;
of the Christian humbling himself
and praying for his own needs....
Perhaps some day this little room will
be visited as S. Charles Borromeo's is
now at Milan. I am favored in that
I know it already. Two purple
stocks and the tasselled hat alone
recalled the <em>bishop</em>, while the framed
table of a 'Seminarist's Duties,' taken
in connection with the simplicity, nay,
poverty, of the room, might make one
think it the habitation of a young
cleric."</p>

<p>And another account adds: "What
a memory to have seen this room, so
narrow, so humble, so evidently the
home of a saint! We shall always be
able to fix the picture of the bishop
in our memory, night or day, praying
or working, at all times; ... and
that beautiful print of Blessed Margaret
Mary Alacoque, and that tiny
<i lang="fr">prie-Dieu</i>!"</p>

<p>The bishop's library, his ordinary
working-room, was also a very simple
retreat, and often fireless in the coldest
days of winter. The house stood
next door to the cathedral, and the
rest of the clergy, four or five in all,
lived there in community. Among
them was the old vicar, the second
priest to whose charge the reconstituted
parish of Geneva had been
entrusted before being raised to the
dignity of a bishopric. It was very
touching to watch this old man lovingly
deferring to the young bishop,
who was formerly but a curate under
him, and rejoicing as a father in the
elevation of one of whose fitness for
the episcopal office he, above all, had
reason to be certain.</p>

<p>"No man securely commands but
he who has learned well to obey."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
Another of the clergy was a very remarkable
man, the type of a character
found nowhere in these days save
under the cowl of the monk, and
even among religious probably nowhere
save in the Benedictine Order.
He was the bishop's private secretary,
and his right hand in the business
of the diocese. He belonged to
the Reformed Benedictines of Solesmes,
and was a friend and spiritual
subject of Dom Guéranger, author
of the invaluable <cite>Liturgical Year</cite>, the
beautiful <cite>History of S. Cecilia</cite>, and
other works. It was only by a special
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>dispensation that he was allowed
to hold his present position and live
outside his cloister; but having, in
early life, been the schoolmate of the
bishop, and being eminently fitted to
wield ecclesiastical sway, this privilege
(which was none to him, however)
had been obtained by Mgr.
Mermillod. He was called rather by
the title of his religious profession, <i lang="fr">le
père</i>, than by his name in the world&mdash;a
name since become known as
that of the author of a learned and
voluminous <cite>Life of S. Dunstan</cite>. He
was, as it were, a stranded pilgrim in
this age of compromise&mdash;a stern,
heroic soul cast in the giant mould of
the XIIIth century; rather a Bernard
of Clairvaux than a Francis of
Sales; in learning a descendant of
Duns Scotus, and a disciple of Aristotle;
an ascetic, a scholastic, a rigid
disciplinarian, an unerring director.
In person tall, dignified, spare of
form, with keen, eagle glance, clear-cut,
largely-moulded features; in dress
simple to rusticity, and a fit model
for an old monkish carving at the
foot of a pulpit or on the boss of an
arch.</p>

<p>They completed each other, these
two saintly characters, the bishop and
the monk, bound together in a mystic
marriage for the production of spiritual
children for God and the
church; and the contrast between
them seemed, as it were, typical of
that other union of distant ages, one
with another, for the furtherance of
a principle ever the same, whether
its accidental exponent be Peter the
fisherman, Hildebrand the Reformer,
Bernard the monk, Francis of Sales,
the gentle bishop, or Pius IX., the
yet more gentle and more persecuted
Pope.</p>

<p>Our stay at Geneva covered three-fourths
of a year, so that we grew
familiar with the beauties of the
neighborhood in its different aspects
of summer, autumn, and winter. It
would be difficult to chronicle every
detail of these beauties of earth, sky,
and water, which, as the seasons
brought them severally into prominence,
seemed to form a series of
cabinet pictures for memory to dwell
upon ever after. There is nothing
like a long stay in one place to make
one feel its loveliness; the transient
wayfarer among the most enchanting
scenes sees not a quarter as much
natural beauty as the constant dweller
in a less favored spot. In the wild
rush, named with unconscious satire
a <em>tour</em>, the traveller sees a kaleidoscopic
mixture of incongruous, discordant
beauties, and of each in detail
he sees but one phase, sometimes
an abnormal one, sometimes an obscured
one, and not seldom he sees
but the vacant place where this beauty
should be. His opinions are hastily
formed, and, strange phenomenon!
the more hastily the more ineradicably,
and they are often erroneous,
or at least one-sided. A man looking
for the moon during the week when
the moon is new, and concluding,
therefore, that no moon exists or is
visible at any time, would not be a
rasher tale-teller than he who asserted
that because he passed twenty-four
hours in Venice during a fog, therefore
the sun never shone in the
Adriatic city; or that since in a week's
scamper through the environs of
Naples he never came across a beautiful
woman, therefore the type of the
Grecian goddess was extinct among
the women of Parthenope. Sweeping
statements are as invariably wrong as
they are temptingly easy to make; it
is needless to say how intellectually
absurd they are. Give your experience
<em>as</em> your experience, and you
will have contributed something to
the sum total of acquisition on any
given subject; but do not give it as
the only, absolute, indisputable, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
final result of research. All knowledge
is but partial; it is subject to
all kinds of qualifications. Few men
can speak with authority of more than
a grain of it at a time, and it is equally
unwise and undignified to put yourself
in the position of the Pharisee
whom the lord of the feast directed
to give place to a guest of worthier
and seemlier station. But this is a
digression. We began by saying that
long residence in one place is the
true way to see, learn, and probe its
beauties; as well as its resources.
Until your heart <em>grows to</em> a place, you
do not <em>know</em> it, and no place unassociated
with family or patriotic connections
can teach your heart to <em>grow
to</em> it without long residence. Perhaps
there are exceptions, corresponding
to "love at first sight," but even this
in human relations is only an exception.
We remember one place, seen
for one day only, for which this
sadder feeling of kinship and yearning
grew up in our heart&mdash;it was
Heidelberg; but intimate knowledge
in ordinary cases is the only channel
to a great and appreciative love.</p>

<p>Geneva won its way to our love
thus, and, more than any one spot we
visited&mdash;not excepting even Rome&mdash;came
to represent to the memory the
happiest, most peaceful, and most
fruitful period of our lives. We shall
be forgiven if we draw a sketch of
the surroundings which are associated
with our knowledge of the Bishop
of Geneva. In all our reminiscences
his figure is the central one, and the
group of persons who formed our
circle of friendship seems naturally
to revolve around his person. Our
summer life was spent in a shy little
villa, invisible from the high-road, and
embowered in groves of pine, chestnut,
and oak; our winter days were
passed, perforce, at the uncongenial
but perfectly appointed Hôtel
de la Paix. The party consisted of
our own family only, with one or two
accidental additions from England
for a week at a time. The house was
slightly built and cottage-like, with a
flight of steps on each side, the front
stoop being festooned with a jessamine-vine,
and the wide, grand drive,
flanked by a bed of flaming balsam-flowers,
sweeping up to the door under
the shade of two or three massive
horse-chestnuts. No room in
the house was carpeted, and only
the drawing-room had a <em>parquet</em> floor.
The bed-rooms were miracles of simplicity
and cleanliness&mdash;milk-white
boards, white-washed walls, no curtains
to bed or window, and an absence
of any furniture, save a narrow
bed, a washstand, a dimity-covered
table, and one cane chair, making
them seem so many dormitory sections
partitioned off. We made the
"best" room a little more picturesque,
as that of a loved invalid never
fails to be, by the help of crimson
velvet coverlets, blue silk and knitted
wool in cushions, a portable easy-chair,
muslin bed-curtains, and a display
of cut-glass bottles with gold
stoppers&mdash;in short, the contents of
an English dressing-case on the
pretty, white-robed table. Books,
also, and any pretty thing that struck
our fancy in the treasure-houses of
the town, accumulated here, and
made of it the choicest room in the
house. We had a severer trysting-place
on the ground-floor, where
reading was carried on systematically,
illuminating and ecclesiastical embroidery
filled up many an hour,
and our journals (from which we
have already quoted) were compiled.
But there was a rarer treasure
yet&mdash;a chapel. A tiny room, darkened
<em>all' Italiana</em>, with red curtains,
and containing a portable altar suitably
draped, recalled the oratories
of Roman <em>palazzi</em>; and here was
often seen the tall figure of <i lang="fr">le père</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
a little chorister from Notre Dame,
as we had Mass said there generally
twice a week. It was a sanctification
to the house, and we felt it an
incitement in our "labor of love" of
reading and manual work. Another
gathering-spot was the wall on the
garden side, forming the parapet between
the terrace and the lower
level of meadow-land. There was a
whole colony of spiders nestled in
the miniature grove of jessamine that
hid the wall; and, as we sat with our
books on the steps leading from the
terrace, we assisted, as it were, at a
perpetual natural history lecture <i lang="fr">in
actu</i>. The webs were generally very
perfect, and, as the autumn came on,
the early dews transformed them into
a jewelled network, shining rainbow-wise,
with the loveliest prismatic
hues. Sometimes, when they were
broken, they seemed like a cordage
of diamonds&mdash;the tangled ruins of
some fairy wreck clinging to the
mast, represented by a green twig.
But there was in the grounds another
more sylvan and lonely retreat still&mdash;our
own especial haunt. It was a
damp valley, below the level of the
high-road, carpeted with periwinkles
and decaying leaves, and shut out
from human observation by a grove
of oaks and chestnuts. A peculiar
darkness always brooded over it, and
one might have forgotten the existence
of noontide had he spent
twenty-four hours in its gloom. A
little brook ran along the bottom, its
waters carrying miniature freight-barks
in the shape of half-opened
horse-chestnuts or curled and browned
oak-leaves. If anything so small
could bear so lofty a likeness, we
should say that this sombre valley
was akin to a Druidical grove.</p>

<p>Our outdoor pleasures were few,
as the world understands them; they
mostly consisted of long drives into
the interior, where we would often
pass dignified, melancholy-looking
iron portals, let into a wall festooned
profusely with the Virginia creeper,
and giving a glimpse of some deserted,
parklike expanse of meadow.
Other less pretentious entrances
showed a wilderness of roses, flowering
shrubs, and vines, but always in
contrast with the luxuriant Virginia
creeper, which nowhere else in Europe
grows in such perfection. A
variety of shades absolutely Western
greets the eye and delights the imagination;
the hues of the Indian summer
seem concentrated in this one
plant, and, from its rich glow, an artist
can easily guess what a forest of indefinitely
multiplied trees, painted in the
colors of this creeper, would look
like. Two of our visitors were welcome
additions to our party and sympathetic
sharers in our pleasures&mdash;one,
a lady well known for her energetic
and active charity, whose presence
in any place pointed invariably
to some hidden work of mercy to be
performed there, and whose mission
just then was to comfort a lonely
and despairing widow under peculiarly
trying aggravations of her sorrow;
the other an artist whose name
in his public capacity has already appeared
more than once in the pages
of <span class="smcap">The Catholic World</span>, and whose
character of childlike simplicity and
reverent earnestness has endeared
him to us in private life as a friend
and a model.</p>

<p>People staying at Geneva&mdash;at least,
English people&mdash;always make a
point of going through the arduous
expedition to Chamouni and the
Mer de Glace. We do not mean to
disparage the spirit which inevitably
urges on our countrymen and countrywomen
to put their necks in jeopardy
on the slightest provocation;
but, turning the adventurous instinct
of our Anglo-Saxon blood to a better
purpose, we chose rather to make two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
or three expeditions to sites hallowed
by the presence of the Apostle of
Geneva&mdash;S. Francis of Sales. Mont
Blanc could not, from any point of
view, appear more majestically beautiful
than it does from the shores of
Lake Leman; and we preferred to
gaze upon the monarch with the eye
of an artist rather than that of a gymnast.
We here lean upon the authority
of Ruskin, whom we are glad
to appeal to in an instance where his
naturally reverential mind makes him
a safe and unbiassed guide. Our
first pilgrimage was to the Castle <em>des
Allinges</em>, on the Savoy side of the
lake, a ruin now, but where, in former
days, the saint often said Mass
in a chapel, which is the only part of
the castle still untouched. There is
no lack of visitors to this shrine during
the summer, and each party is
generally accompanied by a priest.
We were happy in persuading <i lang="fr">le père</i>
to be our companion, and started
overnight for the village of Thonon.
The lake was unruffled, and the sun
shining tropically, as the little steam
boat carried us over the waters.
Thonon is a Catholic village, with an
ugly church, adorned by carved and
gilded cherubs and other unsightly
excrescences ambitiously striving to
be Michael Angelos and Donatellos.
Frogs never can let oxen alone, especially
in art. We slept at the inn,
a picturesque and proportionately dirty
hostelry, very little changed, we
should say, from what it was in the
days of S. Francis. It stands on a
high terrace above the lake, the top
of which terrace forms a drilling-ground;
for Thonon has fortifications
and the ghost of a garrison. The
road from the boat-landing winds up
through stunted vines to a dilapidated
gateway, and is often dotted by
the curious one-horse vehicle of the
country, called <em>char-à-banc</em>&mdash;<em>i.e.</em> a sort
of diminutive brougham turned sideways,
and hardly capable of holding
two persons&mdash;a kind of side-saddle
locomotion rather curious to any one
accustomed to sit with his face to the
horses. The view over the lake by
sunrise the next morning was dreamlike
in its beauty&mdash;each rounded
peak veiled in mist, and the motionless
waters lying at their base as a
floor of azure crystal. As we went
further up into the mountains, the
sun's rays flashed on hill after hill,
throwing a softened radiance over
each, and shooting darts of gold
across the clear blue of the lake. We
met carts laden with wheat-sheaves,
and men and boys going to their
day's work; passed farms and dairies
before coming to the heathery waste
that separates the lonely hill-top of
<i lang="da">les Allinges</i> from the cultivated lands
below; jolted over the stony path,
called, in mockery, a <em>road</em>; and, having
seen in a short two hours' drive as
many beauties as we could conveniently
remember, arrived at the
Chapel of S. Francis. It has been
changed since his time, but the altar
is said to be the one at which he
celebrated Mass. The chapel is a
white-washed room like a rough
school-room, fitted up with painted
benches and cheap prints; but the
feeling that draws so many Christian
hearts to this refuge of the missionary
Bishop of Geneva hallows the
bare walls and open poverty of the
chapel, and a spirit seems to rise
from the altar recess to rebuke any
worldly sense of disparagement or
even disappointment. The manner
in which <i lang="fr">le père</i> said Mass was
enough to make one feel the solemnity
of the occasion and the gratitude
that ought to possess one after
having had the privilege, doubtless
not to be repeated in a lifetime, of
praying on this consecrated spot.
We all received holy communion
during Mass. An old man is station<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>ed
at <i lang="da">les Allinges</i> as <em>custos</em>, sacristan,
and Mass-server; and his little garden,
in full view of the lake, makes a
pretty domestic picture grafted on to
the mediæval one of the "ruined castle
ivy-draped."</p>

<p>S. Francis, so says tradition, often
wandered day and night over this
mountain on his apostolic missions,
and, being once overtaken by darkness,
found no better resting-place
than the fork of a chestnut-tree.
Wrapped in his cloak, he there went to
sleep, lulled by the howling of the
wolves, which abounded in that
neighborhood. Many similar stories
are told in Savoy of his missionary
adventures; one of them recording
that one day he presented himself,
with two or three companions, at one
of the gates of Geneva. The guard,
not knowing him, asked who he was,
before he would allow him to pass;
the saint calmly and smilingly replied,
"I am <i lang="fr">l'évêque du lieu</i>" (the
bishop of the place). The guard,
concluding he was some foreign
visitor, and that <em>Dulieu</em> was the
name of his diocese or manor, nonchalantly
opened the gate, and let
him in. When the magistracy discovered
<em>who</em> had thus got entrance into
the city of Calvin, there was a terrible
outcry; the too innocent guard
was summoned and threatened with
death for his gross neglect of his
duty, and a hasty search was begun
for the hated Papist bishop. S.
Francis had by that time quietly finished
his business and left the hostile
walls of Geneva. This is not unlike
the incident related by Cardinal
Wiseman in <cite>Fabiola</cite>, where a Christian
substitutes for the watchword
<i lang="la">Numen Imperatorum</i>, without repeating
which he could not pass out to
his secret worship in the catacombs,
the words similar in sound, though
widely different in meaning, <i lang="la">Nomen
Imperatorum</i>, and succeeds in cheating
the guard, who was a Pannonian,
and whose knowledge of Latin was
but elementary. It was probably
during one of these stolen visits that
S. Francis administered the sacraments
to a poor Catholic servant-girl
in the cellar of the <em>Hôtel de l'Ecu
d'or</em>&mdash;an old inn still standing at Geneva,
and where the identical apartment
is now shown.</p>

<p>From Thonon we took the boat to
Lausanne, on the opposite side of the
lake, visited the Castle of Chillon,
and returned to Geneva, after another
night spent at the Vevay end
of Lake Leman; where the mountains,
purple and rounded; the vegetation,
southern in its quality and
luxuriance; the winding road by the
shore&mdash;all contribute to remind you
of the Bay of Naples and the Sorrento
road along the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Lausanne itself, its cathedral, monuments,
fortifications, and general
quaintness of architecture and beauty
of position, was the goal of another
expedition, in which our English
friend, Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;, accompanied us,
and became our commentator and
artistic guide.</p>

<p>There were many other places we
also visited; one of us was indefatigable,
and followed the bishop to
Thonex, where he solemnly deposited
a <i lang="pt">corpo santo</i>; to Collonge, where he
blessed a new cemetery with all the
pomp of ritual, made easy by this
village being situated on Savoyard
ground; and to Caronge, where he
distributed the prizes at a girl's
school, and gave an excellent and
appropriate lecture on the education
of women in this century.</p>

<p>But the most beautiful ceremony
of all was the consecration of the
new parish church of Bellegarde,
the French frontier post and custom-house.
This village is a mere
handful of white-washed cottages
dropped among the spurs of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
Jura range. The mountains, though
not high, have all the beauty of
the Alps; their varied outline, their
abrupt gorges, and their swift torrents
being yet more beautiful because
embowered in a vegetation of
softer aspect than the monumental
pineries which close-clothe the
Alps. Within half a mile of Bellegarde
is a curious natural phenomenon&mdash;<i lang="fr">la
perte du Rhône</i>. The river,
here scarcely more than a mountain
brook, after struggling through
a barren, sandy bed, strewn with
boulders of a porous white stone
worn by the action of the water
into strange shapes of vases, cauldrons,
and urns, suddenly plunges
under an arched entrance in a wall
of rocks, and disappears. Its subterranean
course is some miles long,
and it re-emerges, on a lower level,
a placid, shallow stream. Around
the mouth of this unknown cavern
the scenery is very striking; deep
clefts of rock, with fringes of Alpine
flowers, alternate with thick growths
of oak and chestnut; and from
every peaklet of the mountains some
charming pastoral scene comes into
view. The new church was a plain
white building, of no architectural
pretensions, but strong and impervious
to the weather. The internal
decorations were simple in the extreme;
no frog emulation here, as
in ambitious Thonon. For once we
saw French peasants <i lang="fr">au naturel</i>;
they really seemed the fervent, hospitable,
unsophisticated people one
longs to see. The Jura protects
Bellegarde from Geneva; there is no
large town near on the French side,
and there is neither hotel, nor mineral
springs, nor iron mines, nor natural
resources of any kind to attract
the acquisitive mind of the XIXth
century. So God still reigns undisturbedly
in this narrow kingdom&mdash;narrow,
indeed, if measured by the
numerical strength of its inhabitants,
but noble and precious if measured
by the worth of each immortal soul
which it holds. The people were
collected outside the church, as the
full ceremonies of consecration were
going to be performed, and many of
these take place before the people
can canonically be admitted into
the interior. A priest stood on the
natural pulpit of a low stone wall,
describing to the faithful the symbolic
meaning of each ceremony, as
the bishop and his assistants passed
round and round the walls, chanting
psalms and anointing the building,
or, entering the portals, inscribed the
Greek and Latin alphabets in the form
of a cross on the floor of the church,
made seven crosses on the different
internal walls, and recited psalms
and litanies before each. The men
stood in the burning sun, bare-headed
and motionless, often kneeling
in the dust, and singing hymns in
French corresponding to the meaning
of the Latin prayers; a line of
<i lang="fr">Gardes Nationales</i>, in uniforms rather
the worse for wear, and many wearing
the Crimean medal, stood opposite
the entrance, while an excruciating
brass band played with
a will a mixture of national and
religious airs. When at last the congregation
all poured into the church,
High Mass was sung, the brass band
doing duty in a scarcely less subdued
tone than before, but being as much
of an improvement upon the theatrical
and sensuous exhibitions nicknamed
<em>sacred</em> music in many grander
churches, as a rough but pious print
is&mdash;religiously speaking&mdash;an improvement
on a lascivious Rubens. The
sermon (we forget whether preached
by the bishop or not) was a touching
exhortation to the people to remain
knit in heart and soul to this church,
the emblem at once of their hopes in
the future and their spiritual struggles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
in the present. In the afternoon,
the bishop sang solemn Vespers, and
towards dusk we all returned to
Geneva, happy in having witnessed
a ceremony so seldom seen in its
beautiful entirety. Mgr. Mermillod
was throughout the summer our frequent
guest at the villa, and as we
purposed staying through the winter
as well, he promised to accompany
us to Annecy, in Savoy, to visit
S. Francis of Sales' tomb and other
places hallowed by his memory, on
his own feast (29th of January). We
started on the eve in two or three
close carriages, with postilions. The
road lay over a low pass of the
Savoy Alps; the cold was intense&mdash;such
as we have never felt in any
other temperate climate in Europe,
and which nothing but the unexpectedly
rigorous winters of the Northern
States have surpassed in our American
experience. The road was lined
with trees, and valleys here and there
opened a vista which in summer
must have been gorgeous. It was
scarcely less lovely now. Each
slender twig was sharply defined,
and covered with a clinging garment
of frost; the white mist wreathed
itself round the mountain-tops, falling
down the river-sides like shadowy
waterfalls, and, mingling with
the white sky overhead, formed, as it
were, a vast dome of snow. No
noise disturbed the silence save the
creaking wheels of our vehicles, and
as far as eye could reach there was
no sign of life but our own presence.
We might have been in cloud-land,
or below the surface of the ocean,
among hedges of gigantic white
coral! After two hours of this elf-like
journey, we came to a ravine
over which was thrown an iron suspension
bridge, and here the intensely
earthly resumed its dominion and
made itself clearly felt in the prosaic
necessity of paying toll and listening
to profane language, rendered yet
more uncouth by the Savoyard
<i lang="fr">patois</i>.</p>

<p>Annecy is a little, old-fashioned
town, with a cathedral in not much
better taste than the church of Thonon.
The place wears a deserted
look, and, the cold being terrible,
yet fewer of the inhabitants cared to
be seen loitering in the public squares.
We adjourned first to the inn (we
fear modern pilgrims are less fervent
than of old), but could get no fire.
Grates are unknown, and a miserable
stove, badly managed and half filled,
is the starveling and inefficient substitute.
The old inn was a characteristic
place. We went through the
kitchen, the general meeting and
<em>table-d'hôte</em> room, to our upper
chambers. The staircase was wide
enough for a palace, of beautiful
carved oak, as was all the wood-work
in the house. The next morning the
bishop said Mass for us at the shrine
of S. Francis. The building of greatest
interest after this is the Convent
of the Visitation, a rambling house
with a large kitchen-garden, which
we crossed to reach it. We were
shown, through a double grating
(the Visitation nuns are enclosed),
the various relics which form the
spiritual wealth of the convent. They
have the original manuscript of S.
Francis' <cite>Treatise on the Love of God</cite>
written by his own hand, the pen
with which he wrote it, and a shirt
embroidered for him by S. Jeanne
Françoise de Chantal. In the lower
part of the house, corresponding to
the position of a cellar, is a little
chapel partly hewn in the rock,
which serves as the foundation,
where S. Francis gave the veil to S.
Jane and one companion, or rather,
blessed the first semi-religious costume
which the founders of the order
wore. This consisted of a black
gown and cape, and a large, close,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
white cap in one piece covering the
neck and shoulders as well as the
head. This house then belonged to
S. Jane in her own right. In the
chapel to the right of the altar is a
picture of her in this dress, and on
the other side a description of the
simple ceremony. Later on, when
the order was constituted, the dress
became thoroughly monastic, as it has
remained ever since. The cell of S.
Jane is exactly as she left it; not
made into a regular chapel, but, on
days connected with her memory or
that of S. Francis, Mass is said there
at a temporary altar. Her cloak is
kept in a press in the room, and one
of us was privileged in having it
thrown over her shoulders for a few
minutes by the superioress. The
order is not at all austere, but there is
an immense deal of moral sacrifice
imposed by the spirit of the rule. S.
Francis designed it rather as a discipline
of the mind than of the body;
and since saints have differed about
this point, we are not at a sufficient
elevation to pronounce upon it.
Individually, however, we prefer the
spirit of the older and more ascetic
orders, as involving a more complete
oblation of the whole being to God;
but&mdash;to every age its own institutions,
and, we might add, its own saints.</p>

<p>Mgr. Mermillod is surely one of
those saints of our day. Indefatigable
in preaching (once the distinctive
duty of a bishop), his own
flock sometimes complain, not without
reason, that he is always away,
preaching a retreat here, a mission
there&mdash;Lent in Paris, Advent at
Lyons, etc.; but in the winter of
1866, he fortunately preached five <em>conférences</em>
at S. Germain, at Geneva
itself. The church was in the old,
hilly part of the town, but neither
that nor the difficulty of approach&mdash;the
frost made steep roads impassable
that winter, and even the cabs went
on runners&mdash;seemed to diminish the
ardor of the people. All denominations
were represented at these evening
lectures, and the subject was invariably
one accessible to the understanding
and commanding the interest
of all. One, on the regeneration
of fallen man, was peculiarly fine; but
the arguments were perhaps inferior
to the language in which they were
clothed. It wound up with a forcible
peroration on that "brutal and
atheistical democracy which, in its
most hideous exponent (the French
Revolution of 1793), prostrated itself
before a courtesan, and knelt
before a scaffold. When the worship
of God perished, the worship of
shame was the substitute; and when
the blood of God ceased to flow upon
the altar, the blood of man began to
flow on the guillotine." The orator's
enthusiasm in speaking sometimes
carried him beyond his argument,
and he even lost the thread of his
similes in the ardor of his utterance.
His watch invariably stopped before
he had been twenty minutes in the
pulpit, and this <em>entraînement</em> was all
the more vivid from being quite
spontaneous, as he never wrote his
sermons, but preached extempore
from a few scattered notes. How
much study he must have gone
through at a previous time to make
him so polished, as well as so forcible,
an orator, we can only conjecture.</p>

<p>In ordinary social intercourse, his
charm was chiefly sweetness and
sprightliness, with a certain happy
diction which is a special gift, seldom
found except among Frenchmen or
those to whom French has become
a second mother-tongue. Our long
winter evenings at the Hôtel de la
Paix (the cold having driven us
from the villa) were often enlivened
by his genial presence; other friends,
too, came sometimes, and one, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
Russian and an acute thinker, M.
S&mdash;&mdash;, was one of the most welcome.
He was blind, but his infirmity only
seemed to enhance his powers of
conversation, and made his company
more agreeable than it might otherwise
have been. One night, the
bishop was speaking of Lamennais
and his more hidden life. There
were soul-struggles and temptations
assaulting him even in his chosen
retreat of La Chênaie, in the midst
of his triumph, when the Christian
youth of France clustered round
him, and sat at his feet as his humble
disciples. He sometimes fancied
himself irretrievably destined to
eternal loss, and experienced paroxysms
of terrible agony. The Abbé
Gerbet, his confessor, once surprised
him in one of these fits of despair,
and did his best to strengthen and
comfort him; but the demon was
not to be laid so easily. The bishop,
telling us this, added: "The three
greatest geniuses of France in this
age have fallen, the one through
pride, the others through vanity&mdash;Lamennais,
Victor Hugo, and Lamartine."
The conversation having
rested upon these two failings, some
one quoted the saying that "The
greater part of mankind is incapable
of rising to the level of
pride." A Russian lady who was
present then said: "Indeed, one
ought to have a great deal of pride
to save one's self from petty vanity."</p>

<p>Thereupon M. S&mdash;&mdash; quickly remarked:
"Oh! therefore, we should
burn down a city to prevent fires."
Our Russian friend was very sharp at
repartee. Another evening, when he
brought with him a young German,
the conversation fell upon Duke
Ernest of Saxe-Coburg, Prince Albert's
brother. He had lately had an
immense forest awarded to him as
damages for some losses sustained
during the Austro-Prussian war of
the previous summer; so S&mdash;&mdash;
said:</p>

<p>"There are people who make arrows
out of any wood, but he has
contrived to make wood out of any
arrow." This is a French rendering
of "'Tis an ill wind that blows no
one good"; but the connection in
this case between an arrow, a weapon
typical of the war, and the wood,
or forest gained in compensation, is
better expressed by the French form.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
Later on, some one remarked that in
that war the telegraph had been
<em>Prussianized</em> throughout Germany;
and when the young German, S&mdash;&mdash; 's
friend, was trying to give us an idea
of Duke Ernest's ticklish position,
S&mdash;&mdash; interrupted:</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; I know what you
mean; in short, he played the part ...
of the telegraph!"</p>

<p>Mgr. Mermillod had a winning
way of turning everything into a
moral, and at the same time giving
balm to a rebuke and strength to a
counsel. For instance, one day, as he
visited a sick penitent of his, whose
mental energy was for ever soaring beyond
her physical capabilities, he said:</p>

<p>"You will do more good on your
sick-bed than you could in the best
of health in the London <i lang="fr">salons</i>. Remember
that Our Blessed Lord lay
but three hours stretched upon the
cross, and thereby converted the
world; while, during his three years'
ministry, he scarcely converted a
handful of Jews."</p>

<p>On New Year's Eve, 1866-7,
gave us a few little books of devotion
as a souvenir, and then, making
the sign of the cross on each of
our foreheads, said:</p>

<p>"Here are crosses to disperse the
crosses of 1866 and frighten away
those of 1867."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>
<p>Another time, on one of his penitents
going to him with a load of
doubt, uneasiness, almost despair, he
gave her the wisest and gentlest counsels,
after which he said sympathizingly,
comprehending the whole in a
dozen words:</p>

<p>"I understand, my child; you go
from one extreme to another&mdash;from
sadness to laughter, from melancholy
to irony."</p>

<p>Once when some one in his presence
expressed a wish that all priests
were like him, he answered humbly:
"My dear child, every priest is in
some sort an incarnation of the Spirit
of God."<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>It is sad to think of Geneva without
the presence of its pastor, so
admirably fitted as he is to carry
on the work of S. Francis and
execute the designs of God in
this important see. The faith is
most vigorous just where the attack
is hottest, and it is on the missionary
bishoprics, flung thus into the warring
bosoms of non-Catholic nations, that,
humanly speaking, the future&mdash;and
let us say the triumph&mdash;of the church
very much depends.</p>

<p>With such internal bulwarks as the
Benedictine secretary of Mgr. Mermillod
represents, and such external
champions as the eloquent, energetic,
and enlightened bishop himself, it is
not too much to say that not even
the faintest heart has reason to dread
the fall of the rock-built citadel of
Peter.</p>

<h3>CATHOLIC LITERATURE IN ENGLAND SINCE THE REFORMATION.</h3>


<p>It is not surprising that Catholic
literature was at a low ebb for many
years after Henry VIII., of evil memory.
Deprived of the means of
knowledge in their own country
under Edward VI., Elizabeth, and
James I., Catholics were compelled
to seek education abroad in colleges
where they forgot their mother-tongue
and the writers of their native
land. As to their brethren who remained
at home, it was dangerous
for them even to possess books, and
they seldom had time or opportunity
to make themselves acquainted with
their contents. A prayer-book, black
with use and carefully secreted, was
all the library of those who were liable
at any moment to be ferreted out
of vaults and wainscots, and hanged,
drawn, and quartered for believing in
the Papal supremacy. The Puritan
movement in the time of Charles I.
and the Commonwealth was highly
unfavorable to literature in general;
and the Catholics who joined the
royal standard were more anxious
to wield the sword than the pen.
But the fewer the authors who broke
the long literary silence of the Catholic
body in England, the more their
names deserve to be cherished. We
will endeavor, therefore, to make a
<i lang="la">catena auctorum</i>, and to offer a few
comments on each link in the chain.
Though all of them were Catholics
at some period or other of their lives,
they were not all persistent in their
faith nor exemplary in their practice.
It will be understood that they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
cited in their literary capacity, and
not as saints, martyrs, and confessors
in a calendar.</p>

<p>Robert Southwell, however, must
head the list, as he was both author
and martyr. He published many
volumes in prose and verse, though
his life was closed prematurely in
his thirty-fifth year. Educated at
Douay, he labored in England eight
years during Elizabeth's reign. He
was a member of the Society of Jesus,
and he touched the hearts of his suffering
brethren by his tender and
plaintive verse. <cite>S. Peter's Complaint,
with Other Poems</cite>, appeared in 1593,
and <cite>Mœoniæ, or Certaine Excellent
Poems and Spirituall Hymnes</cite>, in 1595,
the year in which he was hanged,
drawn, and quartered at Tyburn,
under a false charge of being engaged
in a political movement. His
real offence was that of the Bishop
of Ermeland and the Jesuits of Germany
in the present day&mdash;his allegiance
in spiritual matters to the authority
of the Holy See. Robert Southwell's
memory is still cherished in
England, and it is not long since
selections from his poems were read
to a crowded audience in Hanover
Square Rooms, London, by the
Rev. F. Christie, S.J. They do
not rise high in poetic merit, but
they are full of noble, just, and devout
sentiments. "Time Goes by
Turns" is found in most collections
of British poetry. The following are
the last stanzas of his "Conscience":</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No change of fortune's calms<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Can cast my comforts down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When fortune smiles, I smile to think<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How quickly she will frown.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And when in froward mood<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She moves an angry foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Small gain I find to let her come,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Less loss to let her go."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Religious writings&mdash;sermons, meditations,
and even works of controversy&mdash;had
more importance, in a
literary point of view, in Queen Elizabeth's
reign than they have now.
At that time, people read little; books
were few and dear. Books of piety
cultivated the mind, though used
chiefly to edify the heart. They
exercised many persons in the art of
reading, who, but for that branch of
literature, would have read nothing
at all. They kept up a habit which
was good on secular grounds, apart
from the higher spiritual consideration.
Looked upon in this light,
the tracts and letters of such holy
men as Campion, Persons, and Allen
(afterwards cardinal) had a twofold
value. Edmund Campion was an accomplished
scholar. He received his
education at S. John's, Oxford, and
being courteous and refined, as well
as clever, he was universally beloved.
After leaving college, he went to Ireland,
and wrote a history of that country,
which was highly esteemed. Having
been reconciled to the church, he
repaired to the new college at Douay,
that he might there study theology;
and after following the usual course,
he was admitted into the Society of
Jesus, and sent to England to comfort
and strengthen his brethren who
were contending for the faith. His
friendship for Persons, his publication
of a work written by that father, entitled
<cite>Reasons for not Going to Church</cite>
(that is, to the parish Protestant
church), and the seizure of a private
press, which a Catholic gentleman
had given to the friends, that they
might work off edifying books and
tracts, led to his apprehension. He
was dragged through the streets of
London, with a paper fixed on his hat,
stigmatizing him as "Campion, the
seditious Jesuit" (July, 1581), and
being tried for treason, of which he
was quite guiltless, he was barbarously
executed, after suffering the
most horrible tortures. The life of
Cardinal Allen, if carefully written,
would be an important addition to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
English Catholic literature, and involve
numerous particulars of thrilling
interest respecting the political
and domestic history of the times.
His writings lie in the border-land
between theology and politics. His
<cite>Apology or Defence of the Jesuits and
Seminarists</cite> was a reply, written in
1582, to the proclamations of the
government which denounced the
Catholic priests as traitors. Persons
engaged in the same controversy,
dwelling chiefly on the dogmatic and
practical side of the question. All
honor to these heroes of the cross,
whom literature as well as religion
claims as her own!</p>

<p>In placing "Rare Ben Jonson"
among Catholic authors, it is not
meant to claim him altogether as one
of the church's children. In early
youth, he bore arms and served a
campaign in the Low Countries.
His troop being disbanded, he took
to the stage; but a hot temper often
led him into brawls, and in one of
these he had the misfortune to kill a
brother actor. Being in prison, he
contracted an intimacy with a fellow-prisoner,
a Catholic priest, which
ended in his conversion. During
twelve years he remained a Catholic,
and then returned to the Established
Church. It was the only pathway
to worldly success, and he became
a favorite with James I., as Shakespeare
had been with Queen Elizabeth.
We name them together, for,
indeed, they were rivals; yet what a
difference between the texture and
the productions of their brains! Ben
Jonson was made poet-laureate,
and wrote comedies and masques
without number. Here and there
we find in his works noble sentiments
worthily expressed, as in
that classical drama, <cite>Catiline's Conspiracy</cite>.
We find also rhythmical
sweetness, as in the song, "To
Celia,"</p>

<p class="center">"Drink to me only with thine eyes,"
</p>

<p>and in the "Hymn to the Moon,"</p>

<p class="center">"Queen and huntress, chaste and fair."
</p>

<p>Now and then he touches a more
sacred chord, and such as might suit
a Catholic lyre, as in the following
hymn:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hear me, O God!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A broken heart<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is my best part.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Use still thy rod,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That I may prove<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Therein thy love.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If thou hadst not<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Been stern to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But left me free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had forgot<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Myself and thee;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For sin's so sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As minds ill bent<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rarely repent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until they meet<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their punishment."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The way had been prepared for
Ben Jonson's success as a dramatist&mdash;not
to speak now of Shakespeare,
Beaumont and Fletcher, Massinger,
and Marlowe&mdash;by the miracle plays
or mysteries of the middle ages, similar
to those which are acted at the
present time among the Indians in
Mexico, and the famous Ammergau,
or Passion Play, in Bavaria. In
these plays, <cite>The Fall of Man</cite>, <cite>The
Death of Abel</cite>, <cite>The Flood</cite>, <cite>Lazarus</cite>,
<cite>Pilate's Wife's Dream</cite>, <cite>St. Catharine's
Wheel</cite>, and the like, were brought on
the stage with the approbation of the
clergy, in order that they might bring
home the mysteries of the faith to
people's heart and imagination, and
supply in some measure the place of
books. The miracle plays had been
succeeded in time by moral plays,
which, from the early part of Henry
VI.'s long reign, had represented
apologues, not histories, by means
of allegorical characters. Vices and
Virtues, however, did not stand their
ground long at the theatre. They
gradually changed into beings less
vague and shadowy, who, while they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
represented vices or virtues in the
concrete, had, in addition, the charm
of resembling real life.</p>

<p>Richard Crashaw's fame as a poet
rests mainly on one line, and that in
Latin; nor was the rest of his poetry
of sufficient force and merit to
enable him always to retain the credit
of that single line. It has over and
over again been attributed to Dryden
and other hands. Yet it is positively
his, and a poem in itself. It
is to be found in a volume of Latin
poems published by Crashaw in the
year in which he graduated at Cambridge
(1635). The line is a pentameter&mdash;on
the miracle at Cana of
Galilee&mdash;and consists of two dactyls, a
spondee, and two anapests. It is often
quoted inaccurately, but we give it
exactly:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i lang="la">Nympha pudica Deum vidit, et erubuit.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The modest water saw its God, and blushed."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The author's mind was devotional
from his earliest years. He had always
been hearing about religion; for
his father preached at the Temple,
and took part largely in the controversies
of the day. There was one
favorable feature in the religious
polemics of that period&mdash;both sides
professed belief in God and in the
Christian religion; now our warfare is
with atheists, deists, pantheists, positivists,
with whom we have scarcely
any common ground. After his election
as a Fellow of Peterhouse in
1637&mdash;about the time that Hampden,
Pym, and Cromwell himself were
embarking for New England, and
were forcibly detained from sailing&mdash;he
became noted in the university
as a preacher, and passed so much
of his time in devotion that the author
of the preface to his poems says: "He
lodged under Tertullian's roof of angels.
There he made his nest more
gladly than David's swallow near the
house of God. There, like a primitive
saint, he offered more prayers in
the night than others usually offer in
the day. There he penned these
poems: <cite>Steps for Happy Souls to climb
to Heaven by</cite>."</p>

<p>In 1644, sorrow came to his calm
nest; and as he would not sign the
covenant, he was driven from the
university he loved and from surroundings
increasingly dear. Accomplished
in Hebrew, Greek, Latin,
Italian, and Spanish, skilled in drawing,
music, and engraving, he was still
more noted for his talent in the higher
art of poetry. He belonged to what
is called the fantastic school of Cowley,
which is full of conceits. But
"conceits" are often original and
beautiful ideas quaintly expressed.
The poetry of conceits was a reflex
of the times, and is, with all its faults,
far preferable to classic platitudes in
flowing verse.</p>

<p>The overthrow of the Church of
England by the Commonwealth was
to Crashaw a cause of poignant
regret. He could no longer bear to
look on the towers and spires of venerable
churches given over into the
hands of bawling, nasal Puritans.
He quitted England, and, crossing
the Channel, found that, in France,
he was a member of no church at all.
His own communion was extinct,
and he was a stranger to the Catholic
Church, before whose altars he
now stood as an alien. But he had
taken up his residence in France, and
it was not long before he decided on
embracing the faith which that land
prized as its most precious heritage.
After the decisive battle of the Civil
War had been fought at Naseby, the
poet Cowley, who was an ardent
royalist, visited Paris, and found
Crashaw in great distress. He represented
his case to Henrietta Maria,
the exiled queen of England, and
presented him to her. He received
kindness from her majesty, and letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
of recommendation to her friends
in Italy. Having made his way to
Rome, he became secretary to one
of the cardinals, and was subsequently
appointed canon of the church
of Our Lady at Loretto. Here he
resided during the remainder of his
days, and died "a poet and a saint"
(as Cowley calls him) in 1650, the
year after the execution of Charles I.</p>

<p>Two years after his death, a volume
of his posthumous poems was
published; and his memory was
honored by Cowley in what Thomas
Arnold calls "one of the most loving
and beautiful elegies ever written."
His <cite>Steps to the Temple: Sacred
Poems, and other Delights of the Muses</cite>,
which appeared in 1646, had reached
a second edition before his decease,
and a third was published in 1670.
In 1785, his entire poems were published
in London, and included a
translation of part of the <cite>Sospetto di
Herode</cite> of Marini. His style resembled
that of Herbert, and a few lines
breathing a Catholic spirit shall be
quoted from his works. It is called
<cite>A Hymn to the Nativity</cite>:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Gloomy night embraced the place<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where the noble Infant lay:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The babe looked up, and showed his face&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In spite of darkness, it was day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We saw thee in thy balmy nest,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bright dawn of our eternal day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We saw thine eyes break from the east,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And chase the trembling shades away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We saw thee, and we blessed the sight:<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>We saw thee by thine own sweet light</em>.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"She sings thy tears asleep, <em>and dips</em><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><em>Her kisses in thy weeping eye;</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>She spreads the red leaves of thy lips</em><br /></span>
<span class="i2">That in their buds yet blushing lie.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet when young April's husband-showers<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shall bless the faithful Maia's bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We'll bring the first-born of her flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To kiss thy feet and crown thy head:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thee, dread Lamb! whose love must keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shepherds while they feed their sheep."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Sir William Davenant was another
poet-convert to the Catholic Church,
and his conversion took place nearly
at the same time as Crashaw's. Like
that poet, also, he was in the favor
of Queen Henrietta Maria during
her exile in France. His life was
full of adventure. As a child, he was
acquainted with Shakespeare, who
frequented the Crown Inn in the
Corn Market, Oxford, kept by his
father. That father rose to be
mayor, and William entered at Lincoln
College. Leaving Oxford without
a degree, he became page to the
Duchess of Richmond, and subsequently
was attached to the household
of the poet, Lord Brooke. Exhibiting
a decided talent for dramatic
composition, he was employed
to write masques for the court of
Charles I. These light plays, of
which Milton's <cite>Comus</cite> is the best
specimen ever produced, were highly
popular, and served for private theatricals
in the mansions and castles
of lords and princes. William
Davenant had fame enough to be
celebrated in his time, and to be
made poet-laureate when Ben Jonson
died; but his writings had not body
of thought, original conception, or
sweetness of expression enough to
preserve them long from oblivion.
His ballad, "My Lodging is on the
Cold Ground," seems to have had
more of the principle of life in it than
anything else he wrote. During the
Civil War, like many other authors,
he flung aside his books, and girded
on the sword. He was then known
as General Davenant, and he negotiated
in the king's name with his
majesty's friends in Paris. Twice
captured, and having twice escaped
to France, he nevertheless returned,
took part in the siege of Gloucester,
and was knighted by the king for his
services on that critical occasion.
In 1646, we find him in France, in
the service of the exiled Queen of
England, attending Mass, and conforming
to the discipline of the Catholic
Church. Living in the Louvre
with Lord Jermyn, he had once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
more leisure to cultivate his taste for
poetry. There he began writing his
longest poem, and a very tedious
production it is.</p>

<p>But his versatile mind was now
occupied by a new scheme. He
promoted an emigration of colonists
from France to Virginia, and, having
embarked for the distant settlement,
the ship in which he was sailing fell
into the hands of one of Cromwell's
cruisers. He was captured and taken
to Cowes Castle, and is said to
have escaped trial for his life through
the kind intercession of his brother
poet, Milton. It was not till after
two years of imprisonment that he
regained his liberty; and when at
last he did so, all his efforts were directed
to a revival of dramatic performances,
which the austere Puritans
had entirely suppressed. He
succeeded at last in establishing a
theatre, and, gaining support by degrees,
he ultimately restored the
regular drama. With the return of
Charles II. his difficulties ended.
King and people alike heaped their
favors on him. He died at his house,
in Lincoln's Inn Fields, in 1668, and
was buried with distinction in Westminster
Abbey. He was very handsome,
of ready wit and a singularly
fertile mind; but it is to be supposed
that his attachment to the Catholic
religion was not by any means a
prominent feature in his character
and career.</p>

<p>Like several of those already mentioned,
John Dryden is but an imperfect
link in the chain of English
Catholic authors since the Reformation.
It was not till a late period of
his life that he entered the true
church, but he lived long enough to
impress on his works a decidedly
Catholic stamp. Indeed, <cite>The Hind
and the Panther</cite>, published in 1687,
some months after his conversion, was
looked upon as a defence of Catholicism.
The hind represented the
Roman Church, and the panther the
Church of England. It was a singular
circumstance, to which, so far as
we have observed, attention has
never been drawn, that three poets-laureate
in succession, Ben Jonson,
Sir William Davenant, and Dryden,
were converts to Catholicity.
The life of the last of these poets
was too long and too eventful to allow
of our recalling even the chief
occurrences by which it was marked.
Suffice it to say that before he was
twenty-eight years old he had passed
from Westminster School to Trinity
College, Cambridge, and had acted
as secretary to his kinsman, Sir Gilbert
Pickering, who stood high in the
Protector's favor, and went by the
name of "Noll's Lord Chamberlain."
On the death of Cromwell, Dryden
wrote an elegy upon him, which was
also a eulogy; and soon after the
Restoration, he commenced writing
for the stage coarse comedies and
stilted tragedies. Married to a daughter
of the Earl of Berkshire, he was
appointed poet-laureate, with £200
a year. This was in 1670, the tenth
year of the reign of his licentious
majesty, Charles II.</p>

<p>When that sovereign expired (having
been reconciled on his death-bed
to the Catholic Church), Dryden
eulogized him as he had eulogized
Cromwell, and in the same poem
turned with alacrity to the praises of
James II. Nor was it long before
he embraced the religion of the Duke
of York. The motives which induced
him to take this step have often been
made the subject of debate. The
authority of Lord Macaulay is constantly
adduced in support of Dryden's
venality and insincere conversion.
But in opposition to this, it
must be remembered that Dr. Johnson
and Sir Walter Scott arrived at
a different conclusion. The latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
biographer of Dryden contends that
the poet's writings contain internal
evidence of his convictions having
been in complete accordance with
the step he took, and that many
external circumstances contributed
to make it easy for him to act in
the way he thought right. Duty and
interest are not always at variance;
and if Dryden gained by the change
in the first instance, when James II.
was on the throne, he lost eventually
many temporal advantages. Having
refused to take the oaths of allegiance
or forsake his religion, he was dismissed,
under William III., from his
offices of poet-laureate and historiographer;
he had the mortification of
seeing Shadwell, the dramatist, whom
he had often ridiculed, promoted to
wear his laurel; and for the rest of
his life, he was more or less harassed
by the ills of poverty. He educated
his children in the faith which he
had embraced, and they showed the
strongest signs of heartfelt attachment
to the person of the Sovereign Pontiff
and the church of which he is the
head. One of them entered a religious
order, another was usher of the
palace to Pope Clement XI. In
writing to them both in September,
1697, Dryden said: "I flatter not
myself with any manner of hopes,
but do my duty and suffer for God's
sake, being assured beforehand never
to be rewarded, even though the
times should alter.... Remember
me to poor Harry, whose prayers
I earnestly desire.... I never
can repent of my constancy, since
I am thoroughly persuaded of the
justice of the cause for which I
suffer." This is not the language of
one who had sold himself for a pension
of £100 a year. Dryden did
not, like Chillingworth, return after a
time to the Established Church. He
died in the religion of his choice, and
many of his poems, particularly the
paraphrase of the <cite>Veni Creator</cite>, and the
two odes on St. Cecilia's Day, breathe
alike the devotion and the well-ordered
ideas of a Catholic. There
is much force in the closing line of
this stanza:</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>When Dryden, in <cite>The Hind and the
Panther</cite>, describes the different Protestant
sects, he very naturally gives
the preference to the Church of England,
and speaks of her with a becoming
tenderness, she having been
the church in which he was nurtured:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The panther, sure the noblest next the hind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fairest creature of the spotted kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! could her inborn stains be washed away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She were too good to be a beast of prey!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How can I praise or blame, and not offend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or how divide the frailty from the friend?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her faults and virtues lie so mixed that she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not wholly stands condemned, nor wholly free.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then like her injured lion (James II.) let me speak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cannot bend her, and he would not break.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If, as our dreaming Platonists report,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There could be spirits of a middle sort.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too black for heaven, and yet too white for hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who just dropped half-way down, nor lower fell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So poised, so gently she descends from high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seems a soft demission from the sky."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Dryden's successor on the throne
of letters in England was Alexander
Pope, who was also a Catholic,
though not a convert. His father, a
linen merchant of Lombard Street,
London, was a Catholic before him,
and had been led to embrace the
faith by a residence in Lisbon.
His were the days of penal laws and
various disabilities, among which was
exclusion from the public schools
and universities. Alexander's education,
therefore, was private, and not
of a first-rate kind. He may almost
be called a self-taught man. He had
seen Dryden when a boy, and he
knew Wycherley, the dramatist, who
is here mentioned because he was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
the number of those who adopted the
Catholic profession under the auspices
of James II. Wycherley was, as
Arnold calls him, "a somewhat battered
and worn-out relic of the gay
reign of Charles II." Macaulay has
little respect for him, for the very
reason that he could interest us&mdash;because
he became a Catholic. He
styles him "the most licentious and
hard-hearted writer of a singularly
licentious and hard-hearted school."
But the gentle Charles Lamb was
more indulgent to his memory and
his works. "I do not know," he says,
in the <cite>Essays of Elia</cite>, "how it is with
others, but I feel the better always
for the perusal of one of Congreve's&mdash;nay,
why should I not add even of
Wycherley's?&mdash;comedies. I am the
gayer, at least, for it; and I could
never connect those sports of a witty
fancy in any shape with any result to
be drawn from them to imitation in
real life. They are a world of themselves
almost as much as fairyland."</p>

<p>We will not pause to discuss the
soundness of this criticism; we
have to do with Pope, and chiefly
with his religious character. No
one can read his "Dying Christian's
Hymn," beginning,</p>

<p class="center">"Vital spark of heavenly flame,"
</p>

<p>without being convinced that the author
was capable of the deepest religious
feeling. The times were not favorable
to a Catholic poet, nor is it in
Pope's writings that we must look for
the strongest evidence of his faith. The
"Letter of Eloisa to Abelard," indeed,
could hardly have been written by a
Protestant; but it says nothing of his
personal religion. We find, however,
by his correspondence with Racine
and others, that though infidelity and
gallantry were the fashion of his day,
he was known among his friends as a
<em>Papist</em>, and that he speaks of himself
as such unreservedly. The words of
Dr. Johnson on this subject are as
follows: "The religion in which he
lived and died was that of the Church
of Rome.... He professes himself
a sincere adherent.... It does
not appear that his principles were
ever corrupted, or that he ever lost
his belief of revelation.... After
the priest had given him the last sacraments,
he died in the evening of
the 30th day of May, 1744."</p>

<p>It is pleasing to reflect that this
illustrious poet, so distinguished by
his deep thought, his affluent imagery,
his pathos, his scathing satire and
matchless versification, recoiled in his
solitude and sickness from the false
philosophy of his friends, and closed
his weary and painful existence at
the foot of the cross; that he departed
hence, not only with laurels on
his brow, but with the Viaticum on
his lips and the church's blessing on
his drooping head. But it was not
at the awful hour of death merely
that he began to prize the religion
which England proscribed. There
is a little anecdote related of him
which shows that he had a distinct
and warm feeling on the subject long
before he came face to face with the
last enemy. He and Mrs. Blount
had been invited on one occasion to
stay with Mr. Allen, at Prior Park,
near Bath, on a visit. Pope left the
house for a short time to go to Bristol;
and while he was absent, it
happened that Mrs. Blount, who was
a Catholic as well as himself, wished
to attend Mass in the chapel in
Bath, and requested the use of Mr.
Allen's chariot for that purpose. But
her host, at that time being mayor of
the city, had a decided objection to
his carriage being seen at the doors
of such a place, and begged to be
excused lending it. Mrs. Blount
felt deeply offended at this time-serving,
and, when Pope returned, told
him her feelings on the subject. The
poet was so incensed at this offence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
offered to his religion and his friend
that he, and Mrs. Martha Blount too,
abruptly quitted the house.</p>

<p>There is, happily, no need of our
contending for the places which
Dryden and Pope should occupy
among literary celebrities. Their attachment
to Catholicism at a time
when it was especially distasteful to
the English people&mdash;during the
reigns, we mean, of William the
Third and Queen Anne&mdash;did not
detract from the popularity of their
writings even while they lived. The
striking genius of Dryden as a translator,
his racy language and manly
style, have been fully appreciated by
posterity; and if we put Pope above
him in the rank of poets, it is because
we discover in the latter more profound
philosophy and rhythmical
sweetness. He enjoyed, too, an advantage
over his distinguished predecessor
in that he was not a convert,
but had from childhood been imbued
with the doctrines of the ancient
faith. The Catholic system, even
more than he knew, lent force and
color to his imagination, restrained
his philosophic speculations within
orthodox bounds, and imparted a
certain majesty and consistency to
his verse, even when it was concerned
with purely secular topics.
It had done the like for Dante,
Chaucer, Calderon, and Corneille
before him, and it has done the
like since for Thomas Moore, as we
shall endeavor to show in a future
number.</p>

<h3>CATHOLIC YOUNG MEN'S ASSOCIATIONS.</h3>


<p>The saying is becoming almost
trite that the Catholic Church has
done wonders in this country. Its
rapid rise, growth, and spread are
little short of miraculous. Half a
century ago, the church was scarcely
known here, save in a misty way, as
something very remote and powerless.
To-day it stands up as a factor
to be counted in American polity.
It points to its five or six millions of
believers. It points to its cathedrals,
its magnificent churches, its splendid
educational establishments, its parochial
schools, its illustrious hierarchy,
its active and zealous priesthood, its
religious orders and societies of men
and women, its lay associations for various
pious purposes, its newspapers,
and its multiplying writers. It has
seized upon the very genius of this
new people. It lags not behind, but
keeps apace with their enterprise;
and scarcely are the piles driven in
for the building of a new city or
town than the cross is seen above
the growing settlement.</p>

<p>Protestants have recognized this
fact. They are daily bearing witness
to its truth. It is but recently
that the press, secular and religious,
was alive with a discussion on "The
Decline of Protestantism," here, in
this very land. And the two foes
that Protestantism had most to dread
were, as all agreed, the one from
without&mdash;Catholicity; the other from
within&mdash;infidelity. It was expected the
Evangelical Council would take into
consideration the same subject: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
best means to be adopted in order to
beat off those two terrible foes&mdash;Catholicity
and infidelity.</p>

<p>All this is well. It is well that the
foes of the church should themselves
testify to the irrepressible spread of the
truth; that they should cut the dividing
lines so clearly between Catholicity
and infidelity&mdash;their Scylla and
Charybdis, either of which is destruction
to them. It is well that the men
who within living memory despised
the church should now come forward
and testify that that church has conquered
them. That they themselves
should thus bear witness to the spread
of Catholicity and the corresponding
decline of Protestantism is flattering
enough, if mere human feeling were
allowed to enter into a question
which involves man's eternal salvation;
but it is well, also, that Catholics
lay not too flattering unction
to their souls.</p>

<p>They may occasionally point with
pardonable pride to their swelling
numbers and all that has been indicated
above; but at the same time,
it would be a fatal mistake to imagine
that everything has now been
done for the church of God; that it
has nothing to do but run on smoothly
in the eternal grooves fixed for it,
sweeping triumphantly through the
country, and bearing away all in its
track. A young and a new Catholic
generation is coming into possession.
It does not know, and can scarcely
appreciate, at what terrible cost, after
what long and painful struggles,
cathedral after cathedral, church
after church, college after college,
school-house after school-house, were
built. It finds them there and is
content, as an heir finds the woods
and the fields won inch by inch by
the toil and the sweat of his father.
If the young generation would not
squander its inheritance, would not
see it dissipated before its eyes, and
slip away out of its nerveless grasp,
it must be up and doing while the
morning of life is on it; tilling,
trenching, delving, casting out the
weeds, watching for the enemy that
would sow tares among the wheat,
that it may leave a larger, a richer,
and a brighter inheritance to its own
children when it is gathered to the
soil of its fathers&mdash;the good soil consecrated
by their bones.</p>

<p>Yes, a goodly inheritance has fallen
upon the young Catholic generation
of America to-day; and a
goodlier yet is in store, to be won by
their own endeavor. Never in this
world's history was there a fairer field
to fight the battle of God in than in
this great country; and never yet,
take them all in all, were there fairer
foes and less favor to contend against.
But let it be borne well in mind, the
battle is a severe one; all the severer,
perhaps, because the field is so open
and Catholics are so free. Here in
America there is nothing of the glory
of martyrdom to sustain us&mdash;a glory
that turns defeat into victory, and by
one death wins a thousand lives.
Ours is not the clash of arms and of
battle, but of intellect. We have to
reason our way along. The cry of
"the decline of Protestantism" is a
cry well grounded. The churches
are losing their children. A reaction
against Puritanism has set in as decided
and as disastrous in its results
as that which set in in England on
the accession of Charles II. The
children throw off even the gloomy
cloak of religion to which their fathers
clung long after the many deformities
and defects it concealed had
shone through the threadbare garment.
The thought of young America
to-day is, "Let the doctors wrangle
about their creeds. All we know
or care to know is that we have life,
and let us enjoy it while we may."</p>

<p>And thus the battle of the age is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
coming to be fought out among
and by the young&mdash;young America
Catholic and young America non-Catholic.
True, our ranks are swelling
daily, and nowadays principally
by native growth. The birth-rate, if
classified as Catholic or non-Catholic,
is so strikingly in favor of the former
as to attract the universal attention
of the medical faculty. Converts,
too, crowd in upon us; but, numerous
as they are, they are only
driblets compared to the vast ocean
that roars outside. Five or six millions
is a mighty number; but there
are thirty millions or more left.
Were it not remembered that God,
although the God of battles, is not
always on the side of the big battalions,
our hearts might sicken at the
mustering of the forces&mdash;our six millions
surrounded, absorbed, as it
were, by that mighty army five times
greater, stretching away dim in its
immensity, yet meeting us at every
turn, and, directly or indirectly, contesting
stubbornly every inch of
ground.</p>

<p>It is true that they are broken
whilst we are one. They fight under
a thousand different banners; and
even while presenting a united
front against us, they are rending
each other in the rear. The deserters
from our side are few&mdash;practically
none&mdash;and such as do go become
objects of infamy even to those who
make a show of welcoming them.
But besides the two directly opposing
forces, Catholics, and Protestants of
some professed creed, there is a
neutral ground, vaster than either,
and equally opposed to both&mdash;infidelity;
and thither is young America
drifting.</p>

<p>And truly it looks a fair region for
a young man to enter. There is no
constraint upon him beyond the pleasant
burden, light to bear, of fashionable
etiquette. A dress-coat and a
banker's account will pass him anywhere.
The man under the dress-coat
does not matter much; and the
inquiry as to how the banking account
came into his hands is not
scrupulously close. He will meet
there the lights of modern science
and literature&mdash;men who can trace
the motions of the world, and find no
Mover; who have sifted the ashes of
nature, to find only matter; who have
analyzed the body of man, to find no
soul in him; to whom life is simply
life, and death, death. There is the
abode of wit, and scoffing, and irreligion,
and bold speculation, and the
unshackled play of the undisciplined
intellect, and under it all the power
to do as you please, because you may
believe as you please, provided you
sin not against the laws of etiquette.</p>

<p>Now, the work of the church is to
break up that neutral ground, which,
indeed, is the most formidable of the
day. It must keep its own young
men from being drawn thither, and
win those that are there into its bosom.
But although in very truth the yoke
of Christ is sweet and his burden
light, it takes a long time to impress
that fact upon youth in the heyday
of life. And with all the power of
the prayer of the faithful, with the
voice of the preacher, and the attractions
of the ceremonies of the church,
there is no merely human agency to
win youth like youth itself; no sermon
so powerful as the unspoken
sermon preached by a Christian
young man, set in the midst of a
world that practically knows not
Christianity. And this is one great
point of the present article.</p>

<p>Our young men and young women
who mix daily in the army occupying
that neutral territory of infidelity
are, or may be made, our best missionaries.
There the voice of the
preacher never or rarely penetrates.
His voice is as "the voice of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
crying in the wilderness." But
though the preacher's words may not
reach there, the effect of his words
may be visible in the conduct of those
whom his words do reach&mdash;the Catholic
youth who live and move in the
daily world.</p>

<p>Hitherto this point has been, perhaps
necessarily, much neglected.
Catholics have not half utilized their
forces. They have not made use
enough of the young. Indeed, the
work of reclaiming them at all has
been a severe one, and is still far from
even the full means of accomplishment;
for it may here be noted
how Protestants cling to the godless
school system, though many of their
best thinkers and leading organs acknowledge
that a system of education
founded on no faith at all must
naturally produce scholars of no
faith at all. But it is time for Catholics
to see that if they would not
only keep their own&mdash;hold fast to
the inheritance that their fathers bequeathed
them&mdash;but also win more,
something more definite must be
done to hold together the young, and
unite them in one common cause.
If you want missionaries, you must
educate them. If you wish the
young to be Catholic, not on the
Sunday only, but always, you must
take the proper means to that end.</p>

<p>Our meaning is this: Catholicity
must not be confined to the churches
only. Half an hour's Mass weekly
is undoubtedly a great deal when
rightly heard; but it is, after all, only
a portion of the spiritual food necessary
to carry a man safely through
the week. The poison of the atmosphere
of utter worldliness that our
young people breathe can only be
counteracted by an antagonistic Catholic
atmosphere; and this can
only be created by having Catholic
centres of attraction under church
auspices, where Catholics may meet
occasionally to converse, to read, to
hear a lecture, or to amuse themselves
in a healthful manner.</p>

<p>It is not long since, at the "commencement
season," we were listening
to the young orators of the graduating
classes of our various educational
establishments. Kind eyes looked
on as they poured forth their eloquent
ten minutes of benison on the
heads of the comrades they were
leaving behind them. It was pleasant
to hear the words of wisdom, of
eloquence, and the soundest morality
fall from their lips. But the
listeners, the admiring parents or
friends, felt, nevertheless, that their
boys were speaking comparatively
from "the safe side of the hedge,"
and that it remained to be seen how
far the good thoughts to which they
gave utterance on leaving the college
would guide them and rule
them in the real battle of life that
was only then about to begin.</p>

<p>What has become of the thousands
of young men who have gone out
and continue to go out, year after
year, from our colleges? For the
most part, they are lost to the eyes
of those who trained their boyhood.
They may continue to hold fast by
the principles they imbibed at school,
or they may not. In our large
cities and towns, there are always
more or less of our Catholic college
graduates, most of whom are unknown
to each other, or rarely meet.
How different would it be had they
places in which to assemble! Something
has been done to meet this very
striking want. Very many churches
have attached to them this or that
young men's association, devoted
generally to literary pursuits; but
for the most part, these excellent
associations have not effected much;
not because they have not the right
spirit and energy, but purely from
lack of organization, from not know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>ing
exactly what to do or what not
to do, from not being united with fellow-associations,
and generally from
lack of funds.</p>

<p>In New York, for instance, where
Catholics boast of half a million of
their creed; where they have so many
magnificent churches, some of them
with very wealthy congregations;
with so many wealthy Catholic residents,
professional men, and large
business firms; with half a dozen
weekly newspapers or more&mdash;where
are the young men? Where is our
Catholic hall, club, reading-room,
library? Nowhere. Nevertheless,
there are, in one shape or form, numbers
of associations of Catholic youth
scattered through the city, and greater
numbers of Catholic youth still who
do not and will not join them, because
they do not find in them attraction
enough.</p>

<p>Now, this is a thing worthy of being
investigated closely, and remedied
speedily. We Catholics ought to be
ashamed of ourselves to see what the
Protestants have done in the organization
known as the Young Men's
Christian Association, with its splendid
reading and meeting-rooms, gymnasium,
and lecture-hall, where the
ablest lecturers of the world hold
forth and draw the crowds of the
city to hear them. Nor does this
association stop here. It has multiplied
itself, not only throughout the
city, but throughout the country.
Branch houses are covering the whole
land; and, whatever may be its present
or its future, it is certainly admirable
in conception and organization.
Its honor and reputation
rest in its own hands.</p>

<p>There is only one association to
which the Catholics of New York,
speaking generally, can point as having
achieved something; as not purely
local, but general, in its character; as,
in fact, a success, though it is still
struggling almost in its infancy. This
is the Xavier Alumni Sodality and
its correlative, the Xavier Union.
That admirable association, the Catholic
Union, is designedly omitted
from the present article, which deals
only with the young men.</p>

<p>The Xavier Alumni Sodality was
established in New York on December
8, 1863. It was intended originally,
as its name implies, for graduates
and ex-students of the College
of S. Francis Xavier. It began with
about half a dozen members. It
gradually and very wisely widened
its scope so as to take in the alumni
of any Catholic college who might
choose to join, as also merchants in
business and professional men. Its
objects may best be set forth by
quoting from the printed "Constitution":</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I. The encouragement of virtue,
Christian piety, and devotion to the
Blessed Virgin among educated Catholic
gentlemen, the perpetuation of friendships
formed by them during their college life,
and the promotion of Catholic interests.</p>

<p>"II. The means to obtain this end
shall be principally the daily practice of
certain devotions, the frequent and worthy
reception of the sacraments, and religious
and social meetings at stated intervals."</p></div>

<p>In the following sections of the
"By-laws" we find:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sec. 14.</span> On the Sunday following
December 8, and on a Sunday during
Easter-time, there shall be a general communion,
at which all members shall be
expected to assist. The first general
communion shall be preceded by a Triduum,
or three days' spiritual retreat.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sec. 17.</span> In case any member of the
Sodality falls sick, the Rev. Father Director
and the President (who is elected
of and by the members) shall appoint one
or more members to visit him.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sec. 20.</span> There shall be a Requiem
Mass for the repose of the soul of a deceased
member as soon after his death as
convenient. The members of the Sodality
are expected to assist at this Mass.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sec. 22.</span> There shall be a standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
committee called the 'Committee on
Employment,' and consisting of the President
and six members of the Sodality,
appointed by him at the January meeting.
[The members meet on the first Sunday
of every month.] Its duties shall be to
assist young men to procure mercantile
or professional employment."</p></div>

<p>There are quite a number of special
indulgences attached to the Sodality,
whose genuine worth and practical
tendencies may be faintly imagined
from this short statement. Its effects,
and the success attained by it, may
best be judged from the fact that the
half a dozen members of ten years ago
have swollen to the number of over
four hundred, notwithstanding losses
by death and by members leaving the
city. This number is being increased
at every meeting; whilst out of the
Sodality has sprung the Xavier Union,
which, though established only two
years ago, already numbers two hundred
members.</p>

<p>To quote the "Preamble" of its
printed "Constitution and By-laws"&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Xavier Union was organized
in March, 1871, by a number of gentlemen,
members of the Xavier Alumni
Sodality&mdash;a Society established in 1863,
and having for its object the encouragement
of virtue and Christian piety among
the educated Catholic young men of this
city [New York], and the promotion of
Catholic interests by their united efforts.</p>

<p>"From this body, in order to unite its
members more intimately, better to carry
out its objects, and to effect other desirable
ends not strictly within the scope of
a purely religious body, the Xavier Union
has been formed.</p>

<p>"This Union has in view both the mental
and moral improvement of its members.</p>

<p>"By a regular and proper representation
of Catholic questions, by association
with men of mature years and study, and
by their frequent meetings with each other,
it hopes to keep alive among its members
a spirit of true Catholicity, and to encourage
by example all Catholic young men
in fidelity to the teachings and practices
of their religion.</p>

<p>"It further proposes to promote the
study of good books, and to foster a taste
for the sciences and arts; but it intends
more especially to exert itself in awakening
and keeping alive an interest in Catholic
history and literature.</p>

<p>"While pursuing these ends, it has in
view the furnishing its members with
every desirable means for their proper
recreation, both of mind and body. Thus
it hopes, by guarding youth against the
temptations of youth itself, and withdrawing
it from the no less insidious than dangerous
associations of a city, to encourage
our educated young men to a proper use
of both mind and body, and to make them
ambitious to be and do good, that they
may exert that influence on society which
is to them indeed a duty.</p>

<p>"In furtherance of these objects, the
Union shall, through its management,
provide&mdash;</p>

<p>"I. A library.</p>

<p>"II. A reading-room having all desirable

<p>"III. Literary and musical entertainments."</p></div>

<p>The best comment on these objects
and the desirability of them is to point
to the success which has already attended
this movement.</p>

<p>The Union, which is recruited exclusively
from the Xavier Alumni
Sodality, rents for its use a building
containing a reading-room, reception-rooms,
billiard-room, and a handsome
library of six thousand volumes. It
is found already that the accommodations
are far too small, and a proposal
is on foot to erect a building adequate
to the growing wants of the
society, and containing a large hall
for the giving of lectures and for other
purposes. The want of this was
found last year, when, for a series of
lectures given under the auspices of
the Xavier Union, it was found necessary
to hire one of the public halls.
Of course, the question is mainly one
of funds.</p>

<p>However, here is something practical,
tangible, which can point to
results, and which challenges the attention
of all Catholics, particularly
of our Catholic young men. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
Xavier Alumni Sodality and the
Xavier Union have so far done everything
for themselves under the guidance
of their able director. Their
work, as may be imagined, has been
very up-hill, for the entrance fees
are not large; nevertheless, with the
profit of lectures, they have constituted
their only source of revenue. In
the face of all difficulties, however,
there they stand, an active and ever-increasing
organization of educated
young Catholic laymen, with their
rooms for reading and amusement,
and their library. They form already
the nucleus of a great Catholic centre,
which, with a little tact, a little generosity
on the part of those who can
afford to be generous, and who could
not be generous for a better purpose,
a steady perseverance in the way
they have entered upon, may rival
any club in the city, may be a rallying-point
for the Catholic laity, and
may furnish a constant supply of
amusement, information, and recreation
of mind and body for Catholics
of all ages, but particularly the
young.</p>

<p>Special attention has been devoted
to these two organizations, because
they are, beyond doubt, the most
prominent associations of Catholic
young men in New York. Indeed,
at the present writing, we know of none
equal to them in the United States.
This is not at all said by way of
flattery to the societies mentioned;
rather by way of reproach to those
who have neglected to form similar
societies. Educated young Catholics
are plentiful in most of our
large cities; and wherever a number
of educated young Catholics exist,
there such societies as the Xavier
Alumni Sodality and the Xavier
Union ought to exist, with their
rooms for association, meeting, reading,
and amusement. Much the
same programme, and much the
same organization, and much the
same aims and tendencies, would answer
for all. A new and wonderful
impetus would thus be imparted to
Catholic thought, Catholic work,
and, above all, to Catholic literature
and education. An <i lang="fr">esprit du corps</i>
would be engendered among our
Catholic youth that is sadly wanting
at present, and that would inevitably
tell upon society. Any large Catholic
project might be almost instantaneously
taken up and discussed
throughout the country; and, above
all, Catholic young men would find
places where healthy amusement was
blended with instruction and blessed
by a religious spirit.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>Neither need such organizations
be restricted, as it were, to any special
class. The Sodality of the Blessed
Virgin, of which the Xavier
Alumni Sodality is a branch, may be
made to embrace all classes. It was
founded in the Roman College of the
Society of Jesus, on December 8,
1563, exactly three hundred years
prior to the foundation of this promising
offshoot in New York. The
society has an eventful history. It
began in the Jesuit Colleges, and was
restricted to the students. It speedily
spread thence throughout the
world, embracing all ranks from the
crowned head to the peasant. One
branch took up one good work,
another devoted itself to some other.
It entered the world, society, the
army, everywhere. Popes belonged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
to it, kings, astute statesmen, great
generals, as well as the rank and file,
and the humblest craftsmen. Many
a saint's name glitters on its scroll.
S. Aloysius Gonzaga, S. Stanislaus
Kotska, S. Charles Borromeo, S.
Francis of Sales, Blessed Berchmans,
and many another consecrated in
Catholic history, were all members
of the Sodality of the Blessed Virgin
Mary. So great was the good it
wrought that popes have bestowed
upon it many rights and privileges.
It has had the glory of persecution.
Infidel governments suppressed it from
time to time, in France particularly,
fearing lest it should lead men back
to God; for if there is one thing
more than another that the devil
fears, it is seeing the young go from
him wholesale.</p>

<p>Now, this matter is worthy the attention
of all Catholics. Enough
graduates go out yearly from our
colleges, and enough intelligent and
zealous Catholic young men are
scattered through our great cities and
towns, to take this matter up earnestly,
and establish Catholic societies
of this kind for practical, pious, and
sanitary purposes. They might embrace
in a short time all the Catholic
youth of America. As has been
seen, the Sodality of the Blessed Virgin
Mary is very elastic in its constitution,
though one in its organization
and aims; and it may be made to
embrace all classes and states of life.
It has history, stability, saintly members,
and good works innumerable to
recommend it. It has been specially
blessed and favored by many popes,
and it has for its head the Blessed
Mother of God, whilst those who enroll
themselves in it do so as children
of Mary.</p>

<p>Coming back to the opposing
forces here at home&mdash;Catholicity,
Protestantism, and infidelity&mdash;we see
nothing more powerful to withstand
the assault of the latter particularly
than Catholic societies of this nature.
The social atmosphere to-day is full
of insidious poison. The young unconsciously
breathe it from their infancy
up. The edifice of faith in
God was never more persistently assaulted
by the united forces of the
powers of this world. No persecution
of the Roman emperors, unless,
perhaps, that of Julian the Apostate,
ever threatened the religion of Jesus
Christ, the Son of God, with a tithe
of the bitterness and hatred that
frown upon it now. Men nowadays
do not so much seek out the chiefs
of the church, the pontiffs, and the
bishops as the little children and the
young of all ages. In some cases, as
in Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and
Brazil, they add open and violent
persecution to its secret and more
fatal forms. The great cry of the
age&mdash;a good and earnest cry&mdash;is for
education. Educate the masses!
Educate all at any cost! That cry
is good in itself, and is as old as the
church of Christ, and no older. But
to it is joined another cry: The
church is out of date. It cannot
educate. It has failed. It will keep
the people ignorant and superstitious.
That is just the right state for
the priests. We know that of old.
The priests in pagan times were just
the same. They kept the people
blind for their own sakes. But the
newspapers have broken all that
up. Men who read their daily
<cite>Herald</cite> or their daily <cite>Times</cite> know a
little too much for that nowadays.
So out with the priests and their
church altogether. We want the
children to know how to read, and
write, and cipher, and be intelligent.
If they want religion, they
may find it where they can. But
religion is quite a secondary consideration
nowadays. It used to
be the first thing. That was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
great mistake. We must now make
it the last.</p>

<p>That is pretty much how the lights
of the age&mdash;the scientific apostles&mdash;talk.
Their opinions are re-echoed
in the pages of journals which, compared
to Christian or Catholic, are as
a thousand, nay, ten thousand, to one;
so that they are ever before the public
eye in one form or other. Consequently,
religion is not only thrown
out of the school, but, to a great extent,
out of the world altogether; nay,
if the accounts our Protestant friends
give of themselves be true, out of the
pulpit also, when preachers preach
"a theology without the <em>Theos</em>, and
a Christianity without Christ." It is
perhaps only natural, then, to find
public morality at a sad discount;
private morality, on a large scale, a
thing ugly to inquire into, and commercial
morality broken down before
commercial gambling. It is not
strange to find the loosest ideas on
the marriage tie prevail, and a corresponding
disregard of the sanctity
of the household and the mutual
obligations of husband and wife, of
father and child, spreading wider and
further every day. It is no wonder
to find public amusements, as a rule,
unfit to be witnessed by the eye of
a decent man or woman. It is not
surprising to see well-dressed crowds
listening eagerly to brilliant lecturers,
who in mellifluous accents and the
chastest English, and in evening costume,
pleasantly and quietly, and in
the best possible taste, laugh away the
idea of God and Christianity; and
it is no surprise to find the children
of those well-dressed crowds growing
up and moving about the world, with
no sense of Christian morality at all,
and at best, to use an ordinary expression,
a human sense of what is
"square."</p>

<p>Right in the face of this scornful
infidelity or shaky faith, it is noble
to see the Catholic world, especially
the young Catholic world, rising up
everywhere to proclaim openly, boldly,
and with no hesitation in the
tone, its whole-souled faith in the
Roman Catholic Church, its tenets,
its doctrines, and its practices. Allusion,
as will be understood, is made
chiefly to the pilgrimages in Europe,
and more particularly to the contingent
furnished by Protestant England.
A pilgrimage, composed of Catholic
young men, visited, the other day,
the shrine of S. Thomas of Canterbury;
another soon after crossed over
to France, to visit the shrine of the Sacred
Heart at Paray-le-Monial; and
doubtless others will follow. We see
it advocated in the Catholic press
that our young men here do likewise.
They would do well; but whether
their desire take living form or not,
certain it is that in this country they
are just as eager to give evidence of
their Catholic faith as in any other.
And just here, in this proposal to
make an American pilgrimage to
some of the Catholic shrines in Europe,
step in the want and necessity
of such Catholic organizations, distinct
enough individually, but linked
together more or less, and springing
from a common centre, to aid effectually
in making such a proposal
feasible.</p>

<p>Coming back to ourselves, the
rising Catholic generation may congratulate
itself that it has fallen upon
good times. It would be well for it
to remember that these good times
are the result of the labors of their
fathers; and that as they were won by
incessant conflict, so they must be retained.
The present generation has
not so many odds to contend against.
That fact is perhaps as much a danger
as a benefit. The Catholic generation
that is passing away had to
suffer more or less a social ostracism.
The barriers between class and class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
are dwindling down; and to-day,
on the whole, a Catholic does not
find his religion mark him off from
his fellow-citizens as a man to be left
out in the cold.</p>

<p>That is no doubt very satisfactory.
At the same time, however painful
may be this kind of social ostracism,
certain it is that the class who come
under its ban are more apt to be
circumspect in their conduct than
classes removed from it. To-day the
spirit of liberality is abroad; but
liberality often means liberalism,
which is a very different thing. The
order of the day is that it does not
matter what you are, Protestant, Catholic,
Jew, or pagan, provided you
only act as everybody else acts.
This sudden effusion of brotherly
love among all castes and creeds is
no doubt very gratifying, and a vast
improvement on old-fogy barriers;
but, at the same time, it involves often
a sacrifice of principle. It is a rank
and unhealthy growth, springing from
the neutral ground of infidelity, or
that unpronounced infidelity known
as indifferentism.</p>

<p>Catholics cannot enter the world
as non-Catholics. Their religion
must be more than a Sunday religion.
It cannot be left outside on
entering their office, nor in the hall
on entering society. It must accompany
them everywhere, not aggressively,
indeed, so as to be outwardly
offensive to the neighbor who does
not believe in it, because he does
not know it, or because he may not
see its effects visible in those who
profess to believe in it; its principles
must guide them in the transaction
of their business, in the amusements
or recreation they take, as
well as in the confessional or at the
altar. Without this, it is no religion.
Without this unaggressive, but none
the less real, atmosphere of piety,
surrounding and emanating from
Catholics in the world as well as in
the church, the heaviness of the present
social atmosphere can never be
lifted. It requires a constant current
to and fro, and this can only be
obtained by the creating of a Catholic
influence right in the heart of
the world.</p>

<p>This is for our young men to do
by their societies and associations;
by knowing each other, meeting together,
consulting, and creating a
tone that will tell sooner or later
upon society. Many a fine young
fellow is lost for pure lack of a good
companion. Many a one spends his
evenings in places and amid society
that, if not actually sinful, are undoubtedly
demoralizing in tendency,
because he has no other society or
place of amusement to enter. It is
too hard upon the young to tell
them that they must not follow the
way of the world, if no better mode
of recreation is provided for them.
The blood of youth is coursing
through its veins, and the heat will
find vent, if not in good, then in
evil. It is the place of all true
Christians to help and provide that
good, by aiding in the work of building
up societies, halls, reading-rooms,
and libraries for our young people.
The blessing will come back upon
their own heads in their children, in
their children's children, and in the
building up of a sound, moral, Christian
tone among the young in these
days, when it is considered more
manly to deny than to inquire; to
sneer at all religion than to kneel
down and adore the God that made
us to his own image. With our
young men linked together thus,
working together throughout the
whole country, showing by deeds,
and words, and open profession that
they are Catholics, those who to-day,
in 1873, wonder at the marvellous
growth of the church within the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
half-century, if God spares them another
half-century, may find their
country, if not Catholic, covered, at
least, and blest from end to end, with
Catholic homes of learning, piety,
and charity; whilst the church may
respond to the foolish taunt that is
flung at her, that her religion is a
foreign religion, and her children
nursed in foreign ideas, by pointing
silently to what her children are&mdash;by
contrasting her Christian sons with
the product and growth of an education
with God left out.</p>

<h3>ENGLISH SKETCHES.<br />

AN HOUR IN A JAIL.</h3>


<p>There is nothing in the exterior of
the building to indicate its real character,
nor is it in any way calculated
to strike terror into the mind of the
beholder whose imagination, fed by
early prejudices, connects the idea
of a jail with gloomy precincts, drawbridges,
and armed sentinels pacing
before frowning gates. The jail of
Reading, the chief town of the royal
county of Berks, presents the very
antithesis of all this. This is a gay edifice
of variegated red brick and white
stone, in the style called carpenter's
Gothic&mdash;a rather appropriate name for
the jocular mongrel performance it
designates, and which is one of the
most surprising hallucinations of the
modern architect's mind. The building
stands close by the Forbury gardens
and at the back of the Catholic
church. The delusion as to
the character of the place is not dispelled
on entering; the uninitiated
stranger might, on passing the great
door, still fancy himself in some free
dwelling, where no abnormal impediments
prevented his exit; but crossing
the court, he ascends by a
flight of steps to a second gate of
ominous appearance, and before
whose glittering steel bars the spell
of liberty dissolves. Within this second
gate there is another, equally
formidable, which opens into a broad
gallery lighted from the roof and
crossed by light bridges at intervals,
to which you ascend by a steep, ladder-like
iron staircase. The second
story is occupied by the women prisoners,
the lower one by the men.</p>

<p>As few of our readers may have had
the opportunity or the curiosity to
go through an English jail, perhaps
they would like to do so vicariously,
as the Shah enjoyed dancing&mdash;sitting
quietly in his chair, while foolish people
fatigued themselves for his entertainment.
We were accompanied
by a young priest, whose ministry
had frequently led him within the
steel gates on another errand than
curiosity; and, thanks to his friend's
(Canon R&mdash;&mdash;) introduction to the
governor, we had permission to see
every detail of the place. The
aspect of the long galleries, with
the bright-tiled flooring and white
walls glancing in the flood of sunshine
flowing from the roof, kept up
the first impression of cheerfulness.
There was nothing so far to suggest
unnecessary rigor or broken spirits,
still less cruelty and demoralization.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
All was airy and exquisitely clean.
Warders in official uniforms paced
leisurely up and down the corridors
and galleries; and though the silence
was broken only by their foot-falls
and our own voices as we conversed
with the warder who acted as our
guide, there was no oppressive gloom
in the atmosphere. The cells opened
on either side of the gallery.
They were each lighted by a good-sized
window looking on the prison
garden and protected by strong iron
bars; in one corner was a complete
washing apparatus, with a water-pipe
over the basin; in another there was
a gas-pipe. The furniture consisted
of a small table, a stool, and a
stretcher-bed, which is rolled up during
the day. On a shelf were the
prisoner's plate and mug. The Protestants
are allowed the use of their
Bible and the <cite>Common Prayer-Book</cite>;
the Catholics have the Douay edition
of the Bible and <cite>The Garden of the
Soul</cite>; special good conduct is rewarded
by the loan of story-books.
Some of the cells were ornamented
with prints from the <cite>Graphic</cite> and the
<cite>Illustrated London News</cite>. A man
with a good conscience and sound
health might live comfortably in one
of these cells.</p>

<p>The Reading jail is worked entirely
on the isolated system, each prisoner
being virtually as much alone amidst
two hundred fellow-captives as if he
were the only inmate. It is urged
against this system that it frequently
leads to madness, total solitude being
the most cruel form of punishment,
and the one against which the human
mind is, by its very essence, least
calculated to bear up. But the theory
applies in its chief force to solitary
confinement, where the sound of the
human voice and the sight of his
fellow-creature's face never intrude
upon the tomblike silence of the
dungeon; where complete inaction of
the body feeds the despondency of
the imagination dwelling on the one
fixed idea of an interminable perspective
of silence and solitude. In the
case of short periods of incarceration,
the separate system must be regarded
as an immense improvement on the
old gregarious one. It prevents the
spread of vice, and protects the comparatively
innocent subject from being
utterly corrupted by the hardened
sinner. In France, where the gregarious
system is in full force, its
effect is too plainly visible in the
most deplorable results. A youth or
a girl goes in a mere novice in iniquity,
and, after a short sojourn in the
midst of the offscourings of society,
comes out utterly depraved. Nowhere
is this truth more lamentably
apparent than in those cases that
come under the head of <i lang="fr">prison préventive</i>,
where any suspected person,
on the smallest amount of evidence,
is thrown into these social sloughs
for weeks, nay, months sometimes,
and held in hourly contact with
thieves, forgers, burglars, and every
species of offender. Strong indeed
must be the principles, and pure the
heart, that come out unshaken and
unsullied from such an ordeal.</p>

<p>The men were at work on the day
when we arrived at the jail, so we saw
the penal system in full operation.
The mildest form of hard labor is the
oakum-picking. It is performed partly
in the open air, partly in the cells,
and consists of untwisting old cables,
and then tearing them into loose
hemp, which is used for caulking the
seams of ships.</p>

<p>The next category was the stone-breaking.
One side of a yard is
walled off into separate compartments,
with a railing at each end,
and from these the ring of the pick-axe
resounds dismally for many hours
in the day. One of these cages was
occupied by a lunatic, who had at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>tempted
the life of his brother. The
poor fellow was only there for the
day, awaiting an order for removal
to some government asylum for the
insane. He stood bolt upright, without
leaning against the wall, with
his hands hanging by his side, and
his head bent downwards, the picture
of melancholy and sullen despair.
We noticed with satisfaction that
the warder compassionately avoided
passing before the poor creature's
railing, and did not even speak within
earshot of him.</p>

<p>On re-entering the house, we came
into a corridor where the air was
filled with a grinding noise of ominous
import. On either side of us
were cells, where the forced labor
in its most severe aspect comes into
view. Warders were walking slowly
up and down, peeping at intervals
into the cells through a narrow little
aperture in the doors, where the prisoners
were undergoing the sentence
of the law. Some were grinding
corn, others were turning the crankpump.
The former is done by a
machine which it takes all the
strength of the workman's two arms
to keep going. In one of these
cells, the door of which was unlocked
for us to examine closely,
there was a lad of a little over
twenty, of middle height, and with a
countenance which, but for the sinister
leer of the mouth, might have
been called mild and almost prepossessing.
We were startled to learn
that this juvenile criminal had been
taken up for highway robbery, with
attempt to murder.</p>

<p>The cell opposite his was occupied
by a middle-aged, broad-shouldered
man, who was turning the crankpump.
This is the most severe of
all the forms of labor in the jail. To
a superficial observer it would seem
almost easy labor, so smooth is the
movement of the crank as it gyrates
under the clenched hands of the prisoner,
his body rising and falling in
rhythmic movement with the rotation
of the crank he is propelling; but the
strain upon the spine becomes after
a while intolerable. This man was
a very hardened criminal, and had
just undergone seven days on bread
and water in the dark cell, twenty-four
lashes of the cat-o'-nine tails
having proved unavailing; and he
was still unsubdued. His misdemeanor
in the prison was swearing
at one of the warders, and threatening
to break his skull against the
wall; even after the fearful infliction
of the dark cell, he repeated his
threat to "do for him."</p>

<p>Coarse-matting weaving is another
prison employment; it is far less
laborious than either of the two
preceding, yet working the heavy
looms must be a great discipline to
unpractised arms. One man's face
in this category struck us as different
from the others; it bore the unmistakable
stamp of education; we
found that the weaver was properly
a man of a better class, and who,
with half the ingenuity he had shown
in getting into his present condition,
might have been a well-to-do member
of society.</p>

<p>In the lower basement there are
admirably constructed baths, immersion
in which is compulsory on the
prisoners once a month. The dark
cell above referred to is also in these
lower regions. Refractory subjects
are consigned to it for three, five, or
seven days, as the case may be, for
insubordination or idleness. It must
be a very obdurate spirit indeed, one
would imagine, which this awful punishment
could leave unbroken. The
darkness is like that of the grave, so
dense that it is suffocating; and when
the warder, to show how utterly
every ray of light was excluded from
the cell, suddenly went out, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
locked the double doors upon us as
we stood in the gloom, we all felt a
chill of indescribable horror creep
over us. The ventilation is, however,
perfect, though we could not
see how it was contrived.</p>

<p>The kitchen department is as
bright and as complete in its appointments
as the rest of the building.
Great and desirable reforms
have of late been effected in the
prison fare, which a few years ago
was so luxurious as to call loudly
for remonstrance from all wise rulers
and thoughtful men. The thief and
the burglar a little time ago fared
far better than the poor working-man
struggling to put honest bread into
his children's mouths, and infinitely
better than the inmate of the workhouse.
All this is happily changed,
and the hospitality of the jail is now
proportioned to the quality of the
guests. The bread is coarse and
brown, but sweet and wholesome.
Each prisoner gets six ounces of it
at breakfast, with a pint of gruel;
eight at dinner, with a pound of
potatoes; and on three days in the
week three ounces of bacon; the
other four he gets cheese instead; at
supper, bread and gruel again. The
quantity is less for a short-period
man, namely, those who are condemned
for a week or a fortnight;
the reason being that the constitution
could not resist for a lengthened
period the low diet, which acts with
salutary effect on the spirit for a
short time. In answer to our inquiries
how far the present system or any
system acted as reformatory on criminals,
the warder said he believed it
very seldom attained that end. A
man who once came to jail was
pretty sure to come twice. "When
a man gets the name of a jail-bird,"
he said, "it is all over with him; he
can never hold up his head again
amongst honest folk, and so he goes
back to his old ways and haunts."
He added that the one chance he
had was to go out of the country to
a place where he had no past to
live down; and for this reason he observed
that the Prisoners' Aid Society
ought to be upheld by all humane
people. It offered the only plank
to the shipwrecked that was possible.</p>

<p>Amongst the two hundred prisoners
which the jail accommodates,
there happens at the present moment
not to be a single Catholic. We
were surprised to hear this, for we
noticed more than once that the
men into whose cells we entered cast
a wistful look at the young priest
who was with us; and when he
smiled and nodded to them on turning
away, their faces relaxed into a
smile too. Mr. S&mdash;&mdash; told us that
this was no uncommon thing; that, as
a rule, the prisoners, whatever be their
religion, welcome the Catholic priest
with a smile, and seem thankful for
the chance of speaking to him. The
parson, on the contrary, they look on
with suspicion, and even with aversion,
frequently listening in sullen
silence to his questions, and refusing
to answer them. This does not betoken
any dislike to the Protestant
minister personally; it arises from
the fact of his having a sort of official
character, and being thus associated
in their minds with the cruel strength
of the law; whereas the priest only
comes in the capacity of a helper&mdash;one
who pities them, and would
serve them in body and soul if he
could; his errand is purely one of
mercy and kindness. Our companion
told us that this jail has for him
many beautiful memories of grace
and repentance. He has gone there
frequently in the course of the winter
to hear the confessions of penitents
who have approached the sacraments
in their little cells with sentiments
of the most touching humil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>ity
and sorrow. These prodigals are
almost invariably Irish. "Wherever
you find a Paddy, you find
the faith," observed Canon R&mdash;&mdash;;
"and where is the spot on earth
where you don't find one?" To illustrate
the truth of this remark, he
told us a curious anecdote, which was
related to him many years ago by
the priest to whom it occurred. This
priest went on the mission to America,
and for some years his labors lay
in the wild regions of the far West.
The missionary led pretty much the
life of the children of the virgin forests
that he traversed, and where the
footprint of the white man was never
seen. He rode for miles and miles
through the wilderness, feeding, like
the anchorites, on what he could
gather by the way, and sleeping in
the branches of some thick-foliaged
tree, to the stem of which he tied
his horse; and at daybreak he was
off on his rambles again. One morning,
as he was riding through a wood
in search of food, he descried a little
wreath of smoke curling above the
trees. He made for the spot, thinking
he had come on a field of labor in
the shape of a little colony to be
baptized; but, on approaching, he
found only a solitary wigwam, at
the door of which a wild woman was
squatting with a brood of small children
about her. The good father
was exhausted with hunger, and
managed, by signs and a few words
of the Indian dialect, to convey this
fact to the woman. She rose at once,
and placed before him her frugal store.
While he was doing justice to it, the
lord of the wigwam returned, and
great was his amazement to behold
the guest whom his lady was hospitably
ministering to. The priest was
trying to air his small store of words,
when his host, who was attired in the
scanty costume of his tribe, with a
plentiful crop of feathers sprouting
from his head-gear, after surveying
him silently for a moment, exclaimed,
"Your reverence is a Catholic priest,
I'll be bound, and an Irishman into
the bargain!" His listener nearly
capsized with astonishment. But it
was neither a vision nor a delusion.
The wild Indian was himself an
Irishman, who, with two older companions,
had come to those remote
forests many years before in search
of fortune in some form or other;
the trio had been captured by the
Indians, who put two of them to
death, and only spared the youngest
on account of his expertness with the
bow and arrow and other kindred
accomplishments which made him
useful to the tribe. He learned in
time to speak their language and
adopt their mode of life, even to the
extent of marrying a wild woman of
their race. But the faith of his childhood
survived amongst the vicissitudes
of this strange career. He welcomed
the priest with joy and the reverence
of a genuine Irish heart; and
before the missionary left his wigwam,
he received the wife into the church,
married the pair, baptized and instructed
the children, and administered
the sacraments to the father. Then
he sallied forth once more on his
life of danger and self-sacrifice, which,
though it afforded many consoling
and romantic episodes, never furnished
such another as this. "Now,"
exclaimed Canon R&mdash;&mdash; triumphantly,
"just tell me if such an adventure
as that could happen to any two men
under the sun but a pair of Irishmen!"
And no one contradicted him.</p>

<p>But to return to the jail. We
visited the church last. It was the
saddest spectacle of all, though the
building itself was bright and just
then full of sunshine. The seats rise
in the form of a steep amphitheatre,
almost touching the ceiling at the
last tier; and they are so contrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
that each prisoner is as isolated in
his own seat as if he were the
only one looking up at the bare
pulpit, where no crucifix, nor pitying
Madonna, nor kindly angel face looks
down upon him, but only the wooden
box, where the preacher once a
week tells him of the message of
mercy, and points to the home where
the Father awaits each prodigal son.
There, locked up between four narrow
boards that rise high above his
head, the prisoner assists at the service
on Sunday. So rigorously is
the separate system maintained that
the two men who were employed in
washing the stairs and floor of the
church were masked, so as not to
recognize each other even in passing,
while a warden stood by to prevent
their exchanging a word together.
The men are exercised in batches
every morning from six to a quarter
past seven in the prison garden&mdash;a
dreary place to call by that flower-suggestive
name. They wear masks,
and walk at a distance of four yards
from one another, holding a rope
with the left hand. Such a system
naturally disarms the dangers of
agglomeration, and makes mutiny
or concerted rebellion impossible.
The strength of union is not theirs,
and they are as feeble as if, instead
of being two hundred against nine,
the proportions were reversed. Attempts
to escape are almost unknown.
The reason of this may be that the
inmates are never condemned to a
longer term than two years, which
would be trebled, both in duration
and in severity, if the attempt failed;
so, in face of such a risk, it would
hardly be worth while to make it.
We did not visit the female department,
which is conducted on precisely
the same principle, the only difference
being the greater lenity of the
enforced labor. It was painful
enough to see strong men brought
to just humiliation for their misdeeds;
but our hearts failed us to look at
women in the same position. On
the whole, we left the Reading jail
with our minds disabused of many
illusions concerning the strong hand
of the law. Its application is as humane
and merciful as is compatible
with the interests of justice and the
professed object of legal punishment.
There is nothing to demoralize or to
harden a culprit whose misfortune
it is to undergo a term of durance
within its walls. Before, however,
such punishment can be really reformatory,
the whole community must
be reformed on the highest Christian
ideal. We must learn not to despise
or unduly mistrust the weak brother
who has fallen once, but to practically
recognize the vital truth implied
in the prayer taught us by our Master:
"Lead us not into temptation;"
remembering that if we have not fallen
it is from no merit or strength of our
own, but of the gratuitous mercy of
God, whose providence has prevented
us in temptation, and saved us
from our own weakness; and that the
measure of our preservation from
evil should be the measure of our
charity to the fallen. When we have
all learned this, we may see our
prisons reformatory as well as penitential;
we doubt if we ever shall
otherwise.</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><span class="smcap">The Divine Sequence.</span> By F. M. London:
Longmans, Green &amp; Co. 1873.</p></div>

<p>This is a small volume, but one replete
with thought. It treats of the relation
existing between some of the principal
doctrines of the faith, with special reference
to the office of our Blessed Lady as
mediatrix of grace. The topics treated,
though they are the most sublime and
mysterious dogmas of faith, are handled
with a theological precision and with a
depth of contemplative piety which show
that the author has drawn her doctrine
from the purest sources, and meditated
on it profoundly within her own soul;
for the author of this admirable treatise
is a lady, though we refrain from giving
her name out of respect to the modesty
which has induced her to hide herself
behind the veil of initials. There are
some copies of the English edition&mdash;which
we regret very much not to see
reprinted here&mdash;for sale at The Catholic
Publication House; and we feel sure
that if the lovers of the choicest gems of
spiritual thought and sentiment knew
the value of this one, they would lose no
time in securing it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Life of Luisa de Carvajal.</span> By
Lady Georgiana Fullerton. London:
Burns &amp; Oates. 1873. (New York: Sold
by The Catholic Publication Society.)</p></div>

<p>This book is an addition to the sum
total of sound Catholic literature. We
almost lose sight of the merit of the
translator's style in admiration of the motive
that led her to undertake the task.
The life of this holy Spanish woman is
strange and pathetic. Her lifelong sacrifice
of worldly, and, what is more, of
national, associations for the sake of an
apostleship in England during the dark
days of the faith in that country, is indeed
a triumph of grace and a heroic
model to all after-ages. Luisa de Carvajal
was a woman of rare strength of mind,
energy, perseverance, and endurance.
Her holiness was that of the champion
rather than of the novice. Her
mind was richly cultivated. Latin was
familiar to her; English she acquired
after she was thirty years of age&mdash;a feat
requiring much patience in a Spaniard.
Her theological knowledge, patristic lore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
and minute acquaintance with the Scriptures
were distinguishing traits of her subsequent
self-education. Involved in a
tedious lawsuit, her accurate memory,
excellent understanding, and unflagging
presence of mind were no less remarkable
than her sweet temper and great patience.
Although never setting her will in opposition
to that of her spiritual advisers,
she invariably conquered their objections,
and by her very humility proved
her superiority. Her vocation to a life
of poverty, without at the same time being
called to a conventual life, was a peculiar
dispensation; and when we think of the
greater ridicule that attended such an
unconventional manner of "leaving the
world," we see how much greater the sacrifice
was than we at the present day
can imagine. Her life in England seems
a romance of self-devotion, and her English
biographer has lovingly dwelt upon
its interesting details. One pregnant
suggestion is made by the translator,
which is, that it would be a specially
holy work for a woman to undertake to
train in a species of semi-religious community
life those young girls whose
future destiny is the instruction of
youth in the higher classes. This, although
applicable chiefly to England,
and of less significance on this side of
the ocean, is a suggestion that deserves
more notice than it is perhaps likely to
get, embedded as it is in the crowded
narrative of Doña Luisa's life. One
thing shines forth out of this exceptional
record of a holy and strong woman's
days, and it is this&mdash;that God somehow
or other always removes all obstacles to
his <em>real</em> will in his own good time. In
her youth, Luisa was foiled, by her natural
guardians and really best-intentioned
friends, in her desire to adopt the
strange life to which God called her&mdash;that
of a recluse without a cloister&mdash;and
in a few years these friends were taken
away, leaving her her own mistress.
Later on, when the seemingly Quixotic
wish came over her to leave Spain to
minister to the English martyrs under
James I., and preach the Catholic faith in
London, her long lawsuit, which was
urged as a reason for giving up this design,
suddenly came to a favorable and</p>

<h3>A TALK ON METAPHYSICS.</h3>


<p>One of the greatest obstacles to
the spread of philosophical education
is the false opinion which, through
the efforts of a school of low scientists,
has gained much ground&mdash;viz.,
that metaphysics, the central and
most important part of philosophy, is
only a mass of useless abstractions
and unintelligible subtleties; a science
<i lang="fr">à priori</i>, telling us nothing about facts;
a dismal relic of mediæval ignorance
and conceit; a thing, therefore, which
has no longer a claim to hold a place
in the world of science. This is a
shameless misrepresentation, and as
such it might be treated with the
contempt it deserves; but it is so
carefully insinuated, and with such an
assurance, that it succeeds in making
its way onward, and in gaining more
and more credit among unreflecting
people. We intend, therefore, to give
it a challenge. A short exposition of
the nature and object of metaphysics
will suffice, we hope, to show our
young readers the worthlessness of
such mischievous allegations.</p>

<p>What is metaphysics? <em>It is</em>, answers
one of the most eminent metaphysicians,
Francis Suarez, <em>that part
of philosophy which treats of real
beings as such</em>. This definition is
universally accepted. It is needless
to remark that a being is said to be
<em>real</em> when it exists in nature; whereas
that which has no existence except
in our conceptions is called <em>a being
of reason</em>. But it is well to observe
that the expression, <em>real being</em>, is used
in two different senses. In the first
it means a <em>complete</em> natural entity,
which has its own separate existence
in nature, independently of the existence
of any other created thing; as
when we say that <em>Peter</em>, <em>John</em>, and
<em>James</em> are real beings. In the second
it means some <em>incomplete</em> entity,
which has no separate existence of
its own, but is the mere appurtenance
of some other thing to the existence
of which it owes its being; as Peter's
<em>life</em>, John's <em>eloquence</em>, James' <em>stature</em>.
Of course, every substance, whether
material or spiritual, simple or compound,
is a complete entity; but
every constituent, attribute, property,
or quality of complete beings is an
incomplete entity, inasmuch as it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
no separate existence, but only partakes
of the existence of the being to
which it belongs.</p>

<p>A real, complete entity is said to
be a <em>physical</em> being, because it possesses
all that is required to exist separately
in the physical order of things. On
the contrary, a real, incomplete entity
is said to be a <em>metaphysical being</em>.
Thus, <em>movement</em>, <em>velocity</em>, <em>time</em>, <em>force</em>,
<em>attraction</em>, <em>repulsion</em>, <em>heat</em>, <em>cold</em>, <em>weight</em>,
<em>work</em>, <em>resistance</em>, <em>figure</em>, <em>hardness</em>, <em>softness</em>,
<em>solidity</em>, <em>liquidity</em>, etc., are metaphysical
beings. Those modern men of
science who shudder at the very name
of metaphysics would do well to consider
for a while this short catalogue
of metaphysical entities. They would
find that it contains the very things
with which they are most familiar. If
metaphysical entities are only abstractions&mdash;empty
and useless abstractions,
as they declare&mdash;what shall we
say of all their scientific books? Are
they not all concerned with those
dreadful metaphysical entities which
we have enumerated? Yet we would
scarcely say that they treat of <em>useless
abstractions</em>. Certainly, when a drop
of rain is falling, the <em>action</em> by which
it is determined to fall is not an
abstraction, the <em>velocity</em> acquired is
not an abstraction, and the <em>fall</em> itself
is not an abstraction. In like manner,
the <em>rotation</em> of the earth, the
<em>hardness</em> of a stone, the <em>sound</em> of a
trumpet, are not abstractions; and
yet all these are entities of the metaphysical
order. Therefore, to contend
that metaphysics is a science of
pure abstractions is nothing but an
evident absurdity. The object of
metaphysics is no less real than the
object of physics itself.</p>

<p>It may, perhaps, be objected that,
though the material object of metaphysics
is real and concrete in nature,
we despoil it of its reality as soon as
we, in our metaphysical reasonings,
rise from the individual to the universal;
for universals, as such, have
no existence but in our conception.</p>

<p>The answer is obvious. The <em>metaphysical</em>
universals must not be confounded
with the <em>logical</em> universals.
The logical universal&mdash;as genus, difference,
etc.&mdash;expresses a mere concept
of the mind, and is a mere being of
reason, or a <em>second intention</em>, as it is
called; but the metaphysical universal&mdash;as
figure, force, weight, etc., is
not a mere being of reason; for its
object is a reality which can be found
existing in the physical order. It is
true that all such realities exist under
individual conditions, and therefore
are not <em>formally</em> but only <em>fundamentally</em>,
universal; for their formal universality
consists only in their mode
of existing in our mind when we drop
all actual thought of their individual
determinations. But, surely, they do
not cease to be realities because the
mind, in thinking of them, pays no
attention to their individuation; and,
therefore, metaphysical universals,
even as universal, retain their objective
reality.</p>

<p>We might say more on this subject,
were it not that this is hardly the
place for discussing the merits of
formalism, realism, or nominalism.
We can, however, give a second answer,
which will dispose of the objection
in a very simple manner. The
answer is this: Granted that abstractions,
<em>as such</em>, have no existence but
in our intellect. Nevertheless, what
we conceive abstractedly exists concretely
in the objects of which it is
predicated and from which it is abstracted.
Humanity in our conception
is an abstraction, and yet is to
be found in every living man; velocity,
likewise, is an abstraction, and
yet is to be found in all real movement
through space; quantity also,
is an abstraction, and yet is to be
found in every existing body. Therefore,
abstract things do not cease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
to be real in nature, though they are
abstract in our conception. This
is an evident truth. If the adversaries
of metaphysics are bold enough
to deny it, then they at the same
time and in the same breath deny all
real science, and thus forfeit all claim
to the honorable title of <em>scientific</em> men.
Statics and dynamics, geometry and
calculus, algebra and arithmetic, are
abstract sciences. No one will
deny that they are most useful; yet
they would be of no use whatever if
what they consider in the abstract
had no concrete correspondent in
the real world. Chemistry itself, and
all the experimental sciences, inasmuch
as they are sciences, are abstract.
Atomic weights, inasmuch
as they fall under scientific reasoning,
are abstractions; genera, species, and
varieties in zoölogy and botany are
abstract conceptions; crystalline
forms in mineralogy are as abstract
as any purely geometric relation.
Indeed, without abstractions, science
is not even conceivable; for all science,
as such, proceeds from abstract
principles to abstract conclusions.
But though the process of scientific
reasoning be abstract, <em>real</em>
science deals with <em>real</em> objects and
real relations. And such is exactly
the case with metaphysics, which is
the universal science of all reality, and
the queen of all the real sciences.</p>

<p>These general remarks suffice, without
any further development, to vindicate
the reality of the material object
of metaphysics. But here the question
arises, Are <em>all</em> real beings without
exception the object of this science?</p>

<p>Some authors, in past centuries,
thought that the only object of metaphysics
was to treat of beings <em>above
nature</em>; and accordingly taught that
God and the angels alone were <em>metaphysical</em>
beings&mdash;that is, beings ranging
above nature. On the contrary,
man and this visible world&mdash;that is, all
creatures liable to local motion&mdash;they
called <em>natural</em> beings, and considered
them to be the proper and exclusive
object of <em>physical</em> science. This view
was grounded, apparently, on the
latent assumption that metaphysics
meant <em>above physics</em>; which, however,
is not correct, as μετὰ does not
mean <em>above</em>, but <em>after</em>; and therefore
metaphysical is not synonymous with
supernatural.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> On the other hand,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>God and the angels are undoubtedly
<em>physical</em> beings; for they are complete
beings, having their complete
physical nature and their separate
existence. We cannot call them
<em>metaphysical</em> beings; for we know of
no beings which deserve the name
of metaphysical but those incomplete
entities which are attained
through the intellectual analysis of
physical and complete beings.</p>

<p>As to man and all the other
natural things, every one will see
that though they are, in one respect,
the proper object of physics, yet they
are also, in another respect, the proper
object of metaphysics; and this
too, without in the least confounding
the two branches of knowledge.
The attributions of physics and of
metaphysics are, in fact, so distinct
that there can be no danger of the
one invading the province of the
other, even though they deal with
the same subject. The office of the
physicist is to investigate natural
facts, to discuss them, to make a
just estimate of them, and to discover
the laws presiding over their production.
This, and no other, is the
object of physics, to accomplish
which it is not necessary to know the
essence of natural things. Hence,
the physicist, after ascertaining the
phenomena of nature and their laws,
cannot go further in his capacity of
physicist. But where he ends his
work, just there the metaphysician
begins; for his office is to take those
facts and laws as a ground for his
speculations in order to discover the
essential principles involved in the
constitution of natural causes, and
to account by such principles for
all the attributes and properties of
things. This is the duty of the
metaphysician. Thus natural things,
although an object of physics when
considered as following certain laws
of action or of movement, are nevertheless
an object of metaphysics
when considered in their being and
intimate constitution.</p>

<p>On this point even physicists
agree. "Instead of regarding the
proper object of physical science as
a search after essential causes," says
one of the best modern champions of
scientific progress, "it ought to be,
and must be, a search after facts and
relations."<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Hence, physical science
deals with natural facts and their
relations exclusively; the search
after causes and essential principles
constitutes the object of a higher
science; and such a science is real
philosophy, or metaphysics proper.</p>

<p>I was surprised at finding in Webster's
<cite>English Dictionary</cite> (v. Metaphysics)
the following words:</p>

<p>"The natural division of things
that exist is into body and mind,
things material and immaterial. The
former belong to physics, and the
latter to the science of metaphysics."
From what we have just said, it is
clear that this division is not accurate.
We must add that it is not consistent
with the definition of metaphysics
given by the same author only a few
lines before. Metaphysics, says he, is
"the science of the principles and
causes of <em>all</em> things existing." Now,
if material things existing do not
belong to metaphysics, it evidently
follows that either material things
existing have no principles and no
causes, or that such principles and
causes are no object of science. But
it is obvious that neither conclusion
can be admitted. Furthermore, it
is well known that all metaphysicians
treat of the constitution of bodies&mdash;a
fact which conclusively proves that
material things are not excluded
from the object of metaphysics.</p>

<p>Here, however, we must observe
that some modern writers, while conceding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
this last point, contend that
material things <em>must be mentally freed
from their materiality</em> before they can
be considered as an object of metaphysics.
Their reason is, that this science
is concerned with real things only
inasmuch as they consist of principles
known to the intellect alone.
Matter, they say, is not an object of
the intellect. Therefore, the object
of metaphysics must be immaterial&mdash;that
is, either a thing which has no
matter of its own, or at least a thing
which is conceived, through mental
abstraction, as free from matter.</p>

<p>But we should remember that, according
to the common doctrine, the
true and adequate object of metaphysics
is <em>all</em> real being as such,
whether it be material or immaterial;
and that it is, therefore, the duty of
the metaphysician to divide substance
into material and immaterial, and to
give the definition of both; for it belongs
to each science to point out
and define the parts of its own object.
Hence, the metaphysician is
bound to explain how things material
differ from things immaterial, and
has to ascertain what metaphysical
predicates are attributable to material
substance on account of its very materiality.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
Now, it is evident that
nothing of the kind can ever be
done by a philosopher who, through
mental abstraction, considers material
substance as freed from its matter.
For when, by such an abstraction,
he has taken away the matter, what
else can he look upon as a ground
of distinction between material and
immaterial beings? We must admit,
then, that material things, inasmuch
as they are <em>real</em> things, and only in
that manner in which they are real
(that is, with their own matter), are a
proper object of metaphysics.</p>

<p>To the patrons of the opposite
view we confidently answer that their
argument has no sound foundation;
for though it is true that no material
thing, owing to the complexity of its
simultaneous actions on our senses,
distinctly reveals to us its material
constitution, yet it is not true that
material things cannot be understood
by our intellect unless they are mentally
stripped of their matter. To
understand them thus would be simply
to misunderstand them. Matter
and form are the essential constituents
of material substance, as all
metaphysicians admit; it is, therefore,
impossible to understand the essence
of material substance, unless the intellect
reaches the matter as well as
the form.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Let us add that those
very authors who in theory affect to
exclude matter from the object of
metaphysics find it impossible to do
away with it in practice, and, in spite
of the theory, devote to matter, as
such, a great number of pages in
their own metaphysical treatises.</p>

<p>Thus far we have defined the object
of metaphysics. We now come
to its method, on account of which
it is so frequently assailed by the votaries
of experimental science. Metaphysics,
they say, is a science <i lang="fr">à priori</i>;
it is, therefore, altogether incompetent
to decide any matters of fact;
and, if so, what is the use of metaphysics?
To this reasoning, which
claims no credit for perspicacity,
many answers can be given.</p>

<p>And first let us suppose for a moment
that metaphysics is a science
altogether <i lang="fr">à priori</i>. Does it follow
that it has no claim to our most careful
attention? Geometry, algebra,
and all pure mathematics are <i lang="fr">à priori</i>
sciences. Are they despised on this
account? We see, on the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
that for this very reason they are
held in greater honor and lauded as
the most thorough, the most exact,
and the most irrefragable of all sciences.
Some will say that the object
of mathematics is not to establish
natural facts, but only relations;
but this is equally true of metaphysics.
The metaphysician, when
treating of physical subjects, assumes
the facts and laws of nature as they
are presented to him by the physicist;
he has not to establish them anew,
but only to account for them by
showing the reason of their being.
Metaphysics would, therefore, be as
good, as excellent, and as interesting
as geometry, even if it were an <i lang="fr">à
priori</i> science.</p>

<p>But, secondly, what is the real
case? To proceed <i lang="fr">à priori</i> is to
argue from the cause to the effect,
and from antecedents to consequents;
whereas, to proceed <i lang="fr">à posteriori</i> is to
argue from the effect to the cause,
and from consequents to antecedents.
Now, it is a fact that in metaphysics
we frequently argue from the cause
to the effect, as is done in other sciences
too; but it is no less a fact
that we even more frequently argue
from the effect to the cause. The
very name of <em>metaphysics</em>, which is
the bugbear of our opponents, clearly
shows that such is the case. Real
philosophy, in fact, is called <em>metaphysics</em>
for two reasons, the first of which
is extrinsic and historical, the second
intrinsic and logical. The historical
consists in the fact that Aristotle's
speculations on those incomplete entities
which enter into the constitution
of things were handed down to
us under the name of metaphysics.
The logical is, because the knowledge
of such incomplete entities must be
gathered from the consideration of
natural beings by means of an intellectual
analysis, which cannot be
made properly without a previous
extensive knowledge of the concrete
order of things. This latter knowledge,
which must be gathered by observation
and experiment, constitutes
physical science. Hence, the rational
knowledge which comes after it,
and is based on it, is very properly
called <em>metaphysical</em>, and that part of
philosophy which develops such a
knowledge <em>metaphysics</em>&mdash;that is, after-physics.</p>

<p>Now, all analysis belongs to the
<i lang="fr">à posteriori</i> process; for it proceeds
from the compound to its components,
and therefore from the effect
to the cause. Therefore, metaphysics,
inasmuch as it analyzes natural
beings and finds out their constituents,
is an <i lang="fr">à posteriori</i> science; and
since such an analysis is the very
ground of all metaphysical speculations,
we must conclude that the
whole of metaphysics is based on
the <i lang="fr">à posteriori</i> process, no less than
physics itself.</p>

<p>Thirdly, that metaphysics cannot
decide any matter-of-fact question
is a silly objection; as it is evident
that to establish the existence of
God, the spirituality of the human
soul, the creation of the world, etc.,
is nothing less than to decide matters
of fact. It may be that, in the
opinion of the utilitarian, such facts
are not very interesting; they are
facts, however, as much and as truly
as the rotation of the earth, atmospheric
pressure, and universal attraction
are facts; and they are much
more important, too.</p>

<p>We might also maintain that metaphysics
is mainly a science of facts;
for there are facts of the intellectual
as well as of the experimental
order. That every effect must have
a cause is a fact. That every circle
must have a centre is another fact.
That a part is less than the whole
is a third fact. Intellectual facts are
as numerous and as certain as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
facts of nature; and it is through
them that our experimental knowledge
of natural things is raised to the
dignity of <em>scientific</em> cognition. For
there is no science, whether inductive
or deductive, without reasoning,
and no reasoning without principles;
and every principle is a fact of the
intellectual order. Those critics
who are wont to slight metaphysics
as an <i lang="fr">à priori</i> science would, therefore,
do well to consider that no true
demonstration can be made but by <i lang="fr">à
priori</i> principles, and that true demonstration
constitutes the perfection
of science.</p>

<p>We may here remark that metaphysics
is usually divided into <em>general</em>
and <em>special</em>, and that the <i lang="fr">à priori</i>
character, for which it is assailed,
belongs to general metaphysics only.
General metaphysics treats of the
constituents, attributes, and properties
of being in general, and is called
ontology. Ontology is considered
as a necessary preparation for the
study of special metaphysics, which,
from the knowledge of being in general,
descends to the examination of
the different classes and genera of
beings in particular. Our men of
science, accustomed as they are to
the inductive method, do not approve
of this form of proceeding.
On what ground, they ask, do you
impose upon the student notions, definitions,
and principles <i lang="fr">à priori</i>, as
you do in ontology, affirming in general
that which has not yet been examined
in particular, and taking for
granted what has yet to be established
and verified?</p>

<p>The answer is obvious enough.
General metaphysics assumes nothing
but what is already admitted as evident
by all mankind. It is mainly
concerned with the notions conveyed
by such words as <em>being</em>, <em>cause</em>,
<em>effect</em>, <em>principle</em>, <em>essence</em>, <em>existence</em>, <em>substance</em>,
<em>accident</em>, etc. These notions
are common, and their methodical
explanation is based on common-sense
principles&mdash;that is, on evident,
intellectual facts. Thus far, therefore,
no one can say that we invert
the natural order of science; for we
start from what is known.</p>

<p>Next comes the analysis of the
notions just referred to. The object
of this analysis is to point out distinctly
the different classes of being,
the different genera of causes, the
variety of principles, reasons, etc.,
implied in those general notions, to
show their ontological relations, and
to account for their distinction. This
important investigation, as well as
the preceding one, is based on common-sense
reasonings, but sometimes
not without reference to other truths,
which are established and vindicated
only in special metaphysics, to which
they properly belong. Thus, it is
the custom to treat in ontology of
the intrinsic possibility of things, and
its eternity, necessity, and immutability;
but it is only in natural theology
that such matters find their full
and radical explanation. Of course,
whenever an assertion is made, of
which the proof is totally or partially
deferred to a later time, the assent
of the student to it is more or less
provisional. It is not, however, in
metaphysics only that a student must
accept certain things on trust; he
thus accepts the equivalents in chemistry,
the distances of the planets
from the sun in astronomy, and the
logarithms in trigonometry.</p>

<p>Yet we confess that philosophical
writers and teachers sometimes expose
themselves to just criticism by
treating in general metaphysics certain
matters which it would be better
to reserve intact for special treatises.
It is doubtless necessary, immediately
after logic, to treat of the nature of
being, and its principles and its properties
in general; but it is extreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>ly
difficult, and even dangerous, to
undertake the settlement of some
questions of ontology connected
with the physical department of
science before these same questions
are sufficiently explored by the light,
and disentangled by the analysis, of
special metaphysics, to which their
full investigation really appertains.
What is the use of giving, for instance,
an unestablished, and perhaps preposterous,
notion of corporeal quantity
to him who has as yet to learn
what is the essential composition of
bodies? Is a student prepared to
realize the true nature of the quantity
of mass, or of the quantity of volume,
who has never yet explored either the
mysterious attributes of formal continuity
or the intimate constitution
of material substance? Certainly
not. He may, indeed, make an act
of faith on the authority of his professor;
but philosophy is not faith,
and no professor who understands
his duty would ever unnecessarily
oblige his pupils to admit anything
as true on his own sole authority.
Questions connected with the physical
laws of causation and movement,
or with the nature of sensible qualities
and properties, should similarly
be deferred to a later time; for no
one will be able to deal successfully
with them, unless he has already acquired
a distinct knowledge of many
other things, on which both the
right understanding and the right
solution of these questions essentially
depend. Accordingly, such matters,
instead of being treated lightly and
perfunctorily at the beginning of the
course of metaphysics, should be
treated with those others to which
they are naturally allied, in order
that they may be fully examined and
competently decided.</p>

<p>From this it will be seen that we
do not want a metaphysical science
based on <i lang="fr">à priori</i> grounds. In all
times, metaphysics has been a science
of facts; and it could not be otherwise,
since its object is real, and all
that is real is a matter of fact. Experiment
and observation have always
supplied the materials of its speculations.
All its conclusions about the
nature of the soul are drawn from the
facts of consciousness; all its affirmations
concerning the constitution of
bodies are founded on the facts and
laws of the physical world; and all its
theses on God, his existence and his
attributes, are likewise deduced from
a positive knowledge of contingent
things. To suppose that metaphysical
knowledge can be obtained otherwise
is such an absurdity that nothing
but the most stupid ignorance
can be made to believe it. And yet
this absurdity is what many of our
modern scientists fall into when they
contend that metaphysics is an <i lang="fr">à
priori</i> science.</p>

<p>It is not difficult, however, to account
for such a dislike of metaphysical
reasonings. The greatest number
of our scientific men have been
brought up under the influence either
of Protestantism or of its legitimate
offspring, indifferentism; and absolute
truth, such as is attained by rigorous
metaphysical reasoning, is not
congenial to their habit of thought.
Protestantism is a system made up of
half-truths, half-premises, and half-consequences.
A Protestant must at
the same time believe the authenticity
of the Bible, and reject the
authority by which alone the Bible
can be proved to be authentic; he
must conciliate the liberty of his
private judgment with the obedience
due to the teaching of his church; he
must have the courage to believe that
true Christian religion is not that
which, from the apostolic times down
to our own, has formed so many generations
of saints, changed the face
of the world, confirmed its own divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
origin by a perpetual succession of
prodigious works, but that which,
starting from Luther or some other
mischievous innovator, has never and
nowhere produced any fruit of high
sanctity or witnessed a single miracle.
Hence, to a Protestant mind, truth
in its entirety must be embarrassing;
since the very essence of Protestantism
is to cut truth into pieces, to believe
and relish a portion of it, and to
reserve some other portion unbelieved
and unrelished, lest nothing should
be left to protest against.</p>

<p>It is clear that minds so disposed
in religious matters cannot be much
better disposed in other branches of
speculative knowledge; and it is but
natural that they should despise
metaphysics altogether. "To the
healthy scientific mind," says a modern
writer, "the fine-spun arguments
and the wonderful logical achievements
of metaphysicians are at once
so bewildering and so distasteful that
men of science can scarcely be got to
listen even to those who undertake to
show that the arguments are but cobwebs,
the logic but jingle, and the
seeming profundity little more than a
jumble of incongruous ideas shrouded
in a mist of words."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Indeed, when
men of science are thus satisfied with
their ignorance of philosophy, and
shut their eyes and their ears, lest the
light, or perhaps the jingle, of logic
compel them to learn what mere experimentalism
cannot teach, we cease
to wonder that they countenance
such theories as the <em>Descent of Man</em>,
the eternity of matter, or the meteoric
origin of the principle of life.</p>

<p>We do not wish to deny the progress
of modern science; we fully
acknowledge that experimentalism
has led to the discovery of important
facts. But this is no reason why our
men of science should disregard philosophy.</p>

<p>An increase of positive
knowledge regarding facts, far from
bringing about the exclusion of
philosophical reasoning, extends its
range, enlarges its foundation, and
makes its employment both easier
and surer. Accordingly, while we
profess gratitude to the modern scientists
for their unceasing labors and
untiring efforts towards the development
of experimental knowledge, we
beg leave to remind them that this
knowledge is not the <i lang="fr">ne plus ultra</i> of
natural science. Subordinate sciences
account in a certain measure for
such things as form their special
object; but philosophy, the highest,
the deepest, and the most universal
of sciences, not only embraces in its
general scope all the objects of human
knowledge, but accounts for them
by their highest principles and causes,
and makes them not only known, but
understood. To know facts is an excellent
thing; yet the human mind
craves something higher. We are
all born to be philosophers. Indeed,
our rational nature teaches us
very early the first elements of philosophy,
and compels us to philosophize.
As soon as we acquire the
use of reason, we detect ourselves
tracing effects to causes, and conclusions
to principles; and from that
time we experience a strong tendency
to generalize such a process, till it
extends to all known objects and to
the ultimate reasons of their being.</p>

<p>Yet we should reflect that our
rational nature, while thus prompting
us to such high investigations, does
not lead us freely to the goal, but
leaves it to our industry to acquaint
ourselves with the proper methods of
discovering philosophical truth. Negligence
in the study of such methods
hinders intellectual advancement, and
leaves men exposed to the snares of
sophistry. Such a negligence on the
part of men who are looked upon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
the lights of modern science is one
of the great evils of the day. Distaste
for philosophical instruction,
when confined to the lower classes
of society, is of little consequence:
even in the middle classes it might
be comparatively harmless if men
were ready to own their ignorance,
and forbore judging of what transcends
their intellectual acquirements.
But in an age like ours, when every one
who has a smattering of light literature
or of empirical science thinks
himself called upon to decide the
most abstruse and formidable questions;
when countless books and
periodicals of a perfidious character
are everywhere spread by the unholy
efforts of secret societies; and, when a
confiding public allow themselves to
be led like sheep by such incompetent
authorities, then ignorance, supported
by presumption or malice on the one
side, and by credulity on the other,
cannot but be the source of incalculable
evils.</p>

<p>Hence it is that all prudent and
experienced men have come to the
conclusion that one of the greatest
necessities of our times is to popularize
the study of sound philosophy.
Young America needs to be taught
that there is a whole world of important
truths ranging above the grasp
of the vulgar, uncultivated mind, unknown
to the pretentious teachers of
a material and spurious civilization,
and unattainable by those who are
not trained to the best use of their intellectual
powers. It needs to realize
the fact that modern literature and
thought in general is full of deceits. It
needs to be instructed how to meet a
host of high-sounding assertions, plausible
fallacies, and elaborate theories,
advanced in support of social, religious,
or political error. It needs to be
enabled, by a sound, uniform, and
strong teaching, gradually to form
into a compact body, held together
by the noble ties of truth, powerful
enough to stem the torrent of infidelity,
and always ready to defend right
and justice against learned hypocrisy,
as well as against ignorant sophistry.
Grown-up men cannot be reclaimed;
they are too much engrossed with
material interests to find leisure for
the cultivation of their higher faculties;
but we are glad to see that
our brilliant and unbiassed youth can
be given, and are ready to receive, a
more intellectual education. Let us
only convince them of the importance
of philosophy; let us provide
them with good, kind, and learned
teachers, and the future will be
ours.</p>

with <em>supernatural</em>:

<p>
Clemens Alexandrinus (<cite>Strom.</cite> i.) considered
<em>metaphysical</em> as equivalent to <em>supernatural</em>;
and is supported by an anonymous Greek commentator,
etc."
</p>
<p>
That Shakespeare's <em>metaphysical aid</em> means
the aid of some mysterious power above nature
may be conceded. But that in Latin <i lang="la">metaphysica</i>
is synonymous with <i lang="la">supernaturalia</i> is an
assertion which can be easily refuted by a simple
reference to any of the great Latin works of
metaphysics. Nor is it true that Clemens Alexandrinus
considered <em>metaphysical</em> as equivalent
to <em>supernatural</em>. He only remarks that Aristotle's
<cite>Metaphysics</cite> is that part of philosophy
which Plato at one time styled "a contemplation
of truly great mysteries," and at other times
"dialectics"&mdash;that is, "a science which investigates
the reasons of the things that are" (τῆς
τῶν ὄντων δηλώσεως εὐρητικὴ τίς ἐστιν ἐπιστήμη).
Now, the science which investigates the reasons
of the things that are extends to <em>all</em> real beings.
It is not true, therefore, that Clemens Alexandrinus
considered <em>metaphysical</em> as equivalent to
<em>supernatural</em>. The truth is that he does not
even use the word <em>metaphysics</em> as his own, but
only says that Aristotle's <cite>Metaphysics</cite> contains
the investigation and contemplation of "mysteries"&mdash;that
is, of abstruse things. And since
Aristotle's <em>metaphysics</em> is not a science of the supernatural,
Clemens Alexandrinus, in quoting
the word <em>metaphysics</em> in connection with Aristotle,
cannot have considered it as equivalent to
the science of the supernatural. Lastly, Clemens
Alexandrinus explains that the science
which Aristotle called <em>metaphysics</em>, and Plato
<em>dialectics</em>, has for its object the consideration of
things, and the determination of their powers and
attributes, from which it raises itself to their
very essence, whence again it ventures to go
further, even to God himself, the master of the
universe. Επισκοποῦσα τὰ πράγματα, καὶ τὰς
δυνάμεις, καὶ τὰς ἐξουσίας δοκιμάζουσα, ὐπεξαναβαίνει
περὶ τὴν πάντων κρατίστην οὐσίαν, τολμᾶ τε
ἐπέκεινα ἐπὶ τῶν ὄλων Θεὸν (<cite>Strom.</cite>, lib. i. c. 28).
This shows that metaphysical science, according
to Clemens Alexandrinus, extends to the
investigation of all natural things. It cannot,
therefore, be said that he considered <em>metaphysical</em>
as equivalent to <em>supernatural</em>, whatever may
have been the opinion of the anonymous Greek
commentator.</p></div>

<h3>DANTE'S PURGATORIO.<br />

CANTO FOURTH.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This Canto, being somewhat abstruse, was passed over at its due place in the series of these
translations. As its omission has been regretted by some students of Dante, it has been thought
best to publish it now, although the first portion of it may seem a little difficult to any but a mathematical
reader. Perhaps its dryness may be somewhat relieved at the close by the humorous picture
of the lazy sinner Belacqua, which is the first slight touch of the comic in this most grave
comedy, and here for the first time Dante confesses to a smile.</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Whene'er the mind, from any joy or pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In any faculty, to that alone<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bends its whole force, its other powers remain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unexercised, it seems (whereby is shown<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Plain contradiction of th' erroneous view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which holds within us kindled several souls).<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hence, when we hear or see a thing whereto<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mind is strongly drawn, unheeded rolls<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The passing hour; the man observes it not:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That power is one whereby we hear or see,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And that another which absorbs our thought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This being chained, as 'twere&mdash;the former free.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">A real experience of this truth had I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listening that soul with wonder at such force,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For now the sun full fifty degrees high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had risen without my noticing his course,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When came we where the spirits, with one voice all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried out to us, "Behold the place ye seek!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A wider opening oft, in hedge or wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some farmer, when the grape first browns its cheek,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Stops with one forkful of his brambles thrown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than was the narrow pass whereby my Guide<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Began to climb, I following on alone,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And lighted me my way. Advancing higher<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In through the broken rock, it left no scope<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On either side, but cramped us close; the ledge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er which we crept required both feet and hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When we had toiled up to the utmost edge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the high bank, where the clear coast expands,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
<span class="i2">"Which way," said I, "my Master, shall we take?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he to me, "Let not thy foot fall back;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Still follow me, and for the mountain make,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until some guide appear who knows the track."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Its top sight reached not, and the hillside rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With far more salient angle than the line<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That from half-quadrant to the centre goes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most weary was I: "Gentle Father mine,"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I thus broke silence, "turn and see that if<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou stay not for me, I remain alone."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Struggle, my son, as far as yonder cliff,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, and pointed upwards to a zone<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Terracing all the mountain on that side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His word so spurred me that I forced myself<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And clambered on still close behind my Guide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until my feet were on that girdling shelf.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Here we sat down and turned our faces towards<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The East, from which point we had made ascent<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(For looking back on toil some rest affords);<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the low shore first mine eyes I bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then raised them sunward, wondering as I gazed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How his light smote us from the left. While thus<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I stared, he marked how I beheld amazed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Day's chariot entering 'twixt the North and us.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Were yonder mirror now," the Poet said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"That with his light leads up and down the spheres,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In Castor and Pollux, thou wouldst see the red<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Zodiac revolving closer to the Bears,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Which fact to fathom wouldst thou power command,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Imagine, with thy mind's collected force,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This mount and Zion so on earth to stand<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That though in adverse hemispheres, the twain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One sole horizon have: thence 'tis not hard<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To see (if clear thine intellect remain)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How the Sun's road&mdash;which Phaeton, ill-starred,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Knew not to keep&mdash;must pass that mountain o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On one, and <em>this</em> hill on the other side."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Certes, my Master,&mdash;ne'er saw I before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So clear as at this moment," I replied<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(Where seemed but now my understanding maimed),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"How the mid-circle of the heavenly spheres<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And of their movements&mdash;the Equator named<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In special term of art&mdash;which never veers<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From its old course, 'twixt winter and the Sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet for the reason thou dost now assign,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Towards the Septentrion from this point doth run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While to the Jews it bore a South decline.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
<span class="i2">But if it please thee, gladly would I learn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How far we have to journey; for so high<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This hill soars that mine eyes cannot discern<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The top thereof." He made me this reply:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Such is this mountain that for one below<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first ascent is evermore severe,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It grows less painful higher as we go.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So when to thee it pleasant shall appear<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That no more toil thy climbing shall attend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than to sail down the way the current flows,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then art thou near unto thy pathway's end;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There from thy labor look to find repose.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I know that this is true, but say no more."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this word uttered, not far off addressed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Me thus a voice: "It may be that before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That pass, thou wilt have need to sit and rest."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At sound thereof we both looked round, and there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld a huge rock, close to our left hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whereof till now we had not been aware.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thither we toiled, and in its shade a band<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Behind it stood with a neglectful air,<br /></span>

<h4>NOTE.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Rev. Edward Everett Hale, in a most interesting paper intended for presentation to the
American Antiquarian Society, in Boston, makes this record:</p>

<p>"When Columbus sailed on his fourth voyage, he wrote to Ferdinand and Isabella a letter which
contains the following statement with regard to the South Sea, then undiscovered, known to us as
the Pacific Ocean:</p>

<p>"'I believe that if I should pass under the equator, in arriving at this higher region of which I
speak, I should find there a milder temperature and a diversity in the stars and in the waters. Not
that I believe that the highest point is navigable whence these currents flow, nor that we can mount
there, because I am convinced that there is the terrestrial paradise, whence no one can enter but by
the will of God.'</p>

<p>"This curious passage, of which the language seems so mystical, represents none the less the impression
which Columbus had of the physical cosmogony of the undiscovered half of the world. It
is curious to observe that the most elaborate account of this cosmogony, and that by which alone it
has been handed down to the memory of modern times, is that presented in Dante's <cite>Divina Commedia</cite>,
where he represents the mountain of Purgatory, at the antipodes of Jerusalem, crowned by
the terrestrial paradise. It is this paradise of which Columbus says, 'No one can enter it but by
the will of God.'</p>

<p>"Of Dante's cosmogony a very accurate account is given by Miss Rossetti, in her essay on Dante,
recently published, to which she gives the name of 'The Shadow of Dante.' Her statement is in
these words:</p>

<p>"'Dante divides our globe into two elemental hemispheres&mdash;the Eastern, chiefly of land; the
Western, almost wholly of water.'"</p>

<p>It is much easier to praise Mr. Hale's valuable comments than to agree with Miss Rossetti. To us
it seems that her confused account lets no light in upon Dante's cosmogony, which was simply that
of the age he lived in, poetized after his own fashion. According to the interpretation of <span class="smcap">The
Catholic World</span>'s translation, Dante divides our globe into two hemispheres&mdash;<em>Northern</em> and
<em>Southern</em>. In the story of Ulysses (<cite>Inferno</cite>, Canto xxvi.) he alludes to a Western hemisphere, and,
as far as we remember, nowhere else. Mr. Hale says in conclusion of his able paper, "I am not
aware that any of the distinguished critics of Dante have called attention to the fact that so late
as the year 1503, a navigator so illustrious as Columbus was still conducting his voyages on the
supposition that Dante's cosmogony was true in fact."</p>

<p>This, indeed, is quite curious, but ought not to surprise one who reflects that the cosmography of
Columbus was not much advanced from the time of Dante. In this very canto the poet shows
that he knew about the variation of the ecliptic and the retrogression of the equinoxes. From his
age to that of the great navigator, science had hardly taken a forward step. In fact, before 1300,
Dante was acquainted not only with the sphericity of the earth, but with the first law of gravitation&mdash;the
tendency of things to their centre. Few consider how very slow was the growth of science
from that which Dante had learned in Florence, and Columbus had studied in Pavia and Sienna, up
to the time of Copernicus, at whom, so late as 1625, Lord Bacon had the hardihood to give this fling:
"Who would not smile at the astronomers&mdash;I mean, not those <em>carmen</em> which drive the earth about,
but the few ancient astronomers, which feign the moon to be the swiftest of the planets in motion,
etc.?"</p>

<p>The pages of this magazine will not permit us to prolong an inquiry that may hereafter, and
which ought to, be made as to the Ptolemean astronomy of the schools in the age of Dante. The
one scholar in this country most capable of such investigation is too busy&mdash;we mean Professor
Peirce, of the U. S. Coast Survey.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Translator.</span></p></div>

<h3>GRAPES AND THORNS.</h3>


<p class="center">BY THE AUTHOR OF "THE HOUSE OF YORKE."
</p>


<h4>CHAPTER VII.<br />

MOTHER CHEVREUSE AGAIN.</h4>

<p>If one would take the trouble to
search into the subject, it would,
perhaps, be acknowledged that the
apparently unreasonable emotion
that women display on occasions
when men find themselves unmoved
is not, after all, entirely ridiculous.
It may be annoying, it may partake
of the hysterical; but, if genuine, it
is the sign of a more subtile, though
often vague, perception.</p>

<p>A woman whom the Creator has
endowed so nobly with intellect as to
make it a source of painful regret
that the infinitely higher supernatural
gifts are lacking in her has written
words which may be quoted in this
connection: "That element of
tragedy which lies in the very fact
of frequency has not yet wrought
itself into the coarse emotions of
mankind; and perhaps our frames
could hardly bear much of it. If we
had a keen vision and feeling of all
ordinary human life, it would be like
hearing the grass grow and the
squirrel's heart beat, and we should
die of that roar which lies on the
other side of silence. As it is, the
quickest of us walk about well wadded
with stupidity."</p>

<p>Had George Eliot been gifted
with faith as with reason, she could
not have written that paragraph
without recollecting that the saint on
earth is an exception to her rule; that
the soul illumined by the Holy Spirit
has so keen a perception, not of
natural things as such, but of natural
things in their relations to God; that
but for the divine strength and peace
which accompany the holy presence,
it could not endure that vision of
eternal results hanging on apparently
trivial causes. To such a soul
there are but two paths, and every
smallest step is in the road to heaven
or the road to hell.</p>

<p>Look at those saints, and listen to
them. They were worn and pallid;
they were consumed by a fiery zeal
because of this awful tragedy they
saw in the perpetually recurring
common events of life. They heard
for ever that roar of eternity from the
other side of the silence of death.</p>

<p>But regarding the natural, of which
our author speaks, she is right. The
greater number of us are "well-wadded
with stupidity," though women
are by nature far less so than men.
Their view is often distorted and
vague; they tremble at shadows, and
do not know where to look for
the substance which casts them; but
the substance is there, nevertheless.
They feel the tragedy hidden in common
things, whether they can explain
it or not. It must be remembered
that while man was made of the slime
of the earth, woman was formed of
flesh; and that the material part
which is the veil between her spirit
and the outer world has felt twice
the refining touch of the Creator's
hand.</p>

<p>Is all this too large an <i lang="fr">à propos</i> to
the tears which women are accused
of shedding whenever they see a
marriage? Think a moment before
deciding. Not the happiness or
misery of these two alone is in question,
but that of an endless line of
possible descendants. There is, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>deed,
no kind of tragedy which may
not follow on a marriage.</p>

<p>After this long preamble, we may
venture to say that both Mme.
Ferrier and Mrs. Gerald were moved
to tears at the marriage of their children;
the former crying openly and
naturally, the latter showing her
emotion with that restraint which
conventional life imposes. Each
understood the other, and was cordially
drawn to the other for, perhaps,
the first time in all their acquaintance.
They stood side by side on the
wharf as the steamer which bore the
young couple left it, and gazed after
their children, who waved handkerchiefs
and kisses to them from the
deck. A few hours in the steamer
would carry them to the city, where
they were to take the cars for Niagara.
Annette wished to see the falls
when the autumn foliage should form
a setting for them, and Lawrence
had his own reason for liking the
place.</p>

<p>"I have the greatest sympathy
and affection for waterfalls," he said;
"and I would like to live near Niagara.
One gets so tired of hearing of
rising and aspiring that it is a real
relief to see some object in creation
that lets things slide, and lays all its
cares on the shoulders of gravity. I
like to see those green waters just go
to sleep and tumble along without
troubling themselves. As I remember
that river, it looked like melted
chrysoprase."</p>

<p>"It is true, my son," the mother
had answered, tremulously tender
and smiling. "But to let things
slide, as you express it, is to go downward."</p>

<p>"And just as inevitably," he rejoined,
kissing her, "does my pretty
mother find something to moralize
about in every random word her
worthless son utters."</p>

<p>They were going, then, to Niagara.
The steamer threw the waters of
the Saranac backward from her prow,
and left a snowy wake, like a bridal
veil, trailing after her. The sun was
going down, and the new moon hung,
a crescent of fire, in the cloudless
west.</p>

<p>"The new moon is over our right
shoulders. Let's wish," said Lawrence.
"That is one of my pet superstitions."</p>

<p>The bride shook her head playfully.
"Then I must forbid your wishing.
We are going to be very good,
you know, and not commit the least
sin to-day." Seeing a faint shade
came over his face at her chiding,
she made haste to add: "We will
convert this superstition into something
good. Fancy Our Lady standing
on that crescent, and say an <em>Ave</em>.
And since we are making the stars
our rosary, we will look for the three
magi. Spanish sailors call by that
name the stars in Orion's belt. He
should be in the east before long.
These sailors say that he who sees
the three magi is not far from the
Saviour. Whenever I see them, and
think of it, I make acts of faith, hope,
and charity. Will you say them
with me to-night?"</p>

<p>Lawrence Gerald looked intently
and curiously at his young wife. If she
had been a stranger to him, he would
have been captivated by her. "Annette,"
he said, "I don't feel so well
acquainted with you as I thought I
was."</p>

<p>"It will take us a good many
years to become well acquainted
with each other," she answered quietly.
"Now let's take a seat at the
other side of the deck, and look for
the three magi. Good-night, Crichton!"</p>

<p>She leaned over the rail, and looked
back for one moment at the city.
Whatever thoughts may have surged
up, whatever fears, hopes, or regrets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
they found no utterance. No one
saw the look in her eyes. Then she
took her husband's arm, and crossed
the deck.</p>

<p>"There come the Pleiades, like a
little cluster of golden grapes, and
there is Aldebaran; and now, Orion,
buckle on your belt, and come forth."</p>

<p>"By the way," said Lawrence,
struck by a sudden thought, "you
are Mrs. Gerald; did you know it?"</p>

<p>"Are you sorry for it?" she asked,
and tried to make the question sound
playful, but with ill success.</p>

<p>"I am rather astonished," he replied;
and seemed really to find the
thought a new one.</p>

<p>Annette could not restrain a
momentary outburst, though she
blushed with mortification for it as
soon as the words were spoken.
"O Lawrence! cannot you speak
one word of kindness to me?" As
though that could be kindness which
waits till asked for.</p>

<p>He took the appeal jestingly. "You
shall dictate. Only tell me what
you would be pleased to have me
say, and I will repeat it, like an
obedient husband."</p>

<p>Then, seeing her blush, and that
she shrank from him with a look that
was almost aversion, he spoke seriously.</p>

<p>"I do not mean to be unkind to
you, Annette. Have patience with
me. You have made a bad bargain,
but I am, perhaps, more grateful
than I appear; and I like you better
every day."</p>

<p>She made no reply, but leaned
back and looked at the stars coming
out, one by one. There was no delight
in her heart, but a greater peace
and sweetness than she had even
hoped for. "I like you better every
day." How softly the words echoed
in her ears!</p>

<p>When the steamer had disappeared
around a curve of the river, Mrs.
Ferrier turned her tear-drenched face
to Mrs. Gerald, and sobbed out,
"They are gone! They are not our
children any more."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gerald did not trust herself
to speak; but she laid a kind hand on
the mother's arm, and tried to smile.</p>

<p>"Do come home with me!" Mrs.
Ferrier begged. "It is so lonesome
there I can't bear to go into the
house. Come and stay to tea, you
and Honora."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Gerald had promised to
drive out with Mrs. Macon to see
the Sisters, and the bright little lady
was waiting impatiently for her; so
to Honora was left the task of comforting
Annette's mother.</p>

<p>On their way home, Mrs. Ferrier
started up suddenly, and ordered the
coachman to stop. "I don't care
if he is a Jew," she said, having
caught sight of Mr. Schöninger.
"He's good enough to be a Christian;
and I'm going to ask him to
supper." And before Honora could
prevent it, even if she had desired to,
the gentleman had been beckoned
to the carriage, and the invitation
given and accepted.</p>

<p>"I'm not what people call a lady,"
Mrs. Ferrier said, as they drove on
again, "but I believe I know a
gentleman when I see him; and if
there ever was a true gentleman, he
is one. How he does it I don't
know; but he some way makes me
respect myself. He doesn't flatter
me; I am sure he doesn't care for my
money, and that he knows I am no
scholar; but it seems to me as if he
thinks there is something respectable
in being an honest woman, no matter
how ignorant you are; and I'm just
as sure that that man never laughs
at me, and is mad when other people
do it, as I am that I sit here. In my
house, when some of those little
upstarts have been talking to me,
and trying to make me say things&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>I
knew all the time what they were
up to!&mdash;I've seen him come marching
across the room to me like a
king, and scatter them as if they were
mice, with just one glance of his eyes.
I'm not a fool, and I know my
friends."</p>

<p>Honora's visit was a short one;
and after an hour of pleasant talk,
she started for home, accompanied
by Mr. Schöninger. They had been
speaking of the <cite>Moonlight Sonata</cite>;
and, since the hour was early, the
gentleman asked permission to go
in and play it on Miss Pembroke's
piano.</p>

<p>"I was about to ask you to," she
said cordially. "It has been on my
mind that I never heard you play
that; and I fancy that my piano is
just the instrument for it, the tone
is so soft and rich."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gerald had not yet returned.
The night was very warm, and the
doors and windows all stood open,
the parlor being lighted only from
the next room. Honora seated herself
by an open window, and listened
with a perfect enjoyment to which
nothing was wanting. She was in
the mood to hear music, the composition
and the rendering were both
excellent, and the half-light in-doors
and out not only veiled all defects
in their surroundings, but invested
them with a soft and dreamy grace.</p>

<p>Her mood was so happy that,
when the sonata was ended, she did
not feel obliged to praise it, nor to
speak at all; and they were silent a
little while, Mr. Schöninger touching
octaves with his right hand so exquisitely
that they faltered out as
the stars come&mdash;faint at first, yet
ending brightly.</p>

<p>"I like to look on the whole of
creation as a symphony," he said
presently. "The morning stars sang
together. What a song it must be
to the ears that can hear it! Fancy
them setting out on that race, their
hearts on fire, their orbits ringing as
they rolled, their sides blooming,
light just kindled! The stars, then,
being tuneful, everything on their
surfaces and beneath them must
have been harmonious. How complex
and wonderful&mdash;large and
small, from the song of the sun to the
song of the pine-needles! The ocean
had its tune, and the rivers, and
there was music in the clouds that
rose from them. How ethereal it
must have been! Yes, nature was
born singing, and everything was
musically ordered. The days were
grouped in octaves. They climbed
from Sabbath to Sabbath."</p>

<p>He had spoken slowly, as if to
himself, or to some sweeter self, and
let a note drop here and there into
pauses. He paused a moment now,
then added: "What is music? It
is harmonious action; and in action
the mystical number is seven."</p>

<p>He lifted his head, but not his
eyes, and seemed to await a reply.</p>

<p>"And in being, the perfect number
is three," Honora said quietly.</p>

<p>He did not answer for a moment,
and, if he understood her meaning,
did not reply to it when he spoke.
"I had not thought of that; but I
catch a glimpse of truth in your remark
which I should like to follow
out. In nature, there are the three
colors for one item. In art&mdash;say,
architecture&mdash;there are the three
types: the rectangular Greek, rounding
up into Roman, as if lifted over
a head passing under, and the
Gothic, shaped like a flame. Those
may be the signs of the material, the
intellectual, and the spiritual. Yes,
I must follow that out."</p>

<p>The light was too dim to show
how Miss Pembroke's cheeks reddened
as she said, "The feasts in
the church carry out this musical
idea, and have their octaves; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
for the Supreme Being, there is trinity."</p>

<p>Was it fair or wise to catch him
so? She doubted, and awaited his
next remark in some agitation.</p>

<p>"Miss Pembroke, I respect your
opinions and your beliefs," he said,
with a dignified emphasis which
might be meant to reassure or to reprove
her. In either case, it was
impossible for her to pursue the subject.</p>

<p>Feeling slightly embarrassed, she
caught at the first subject that presented
itself. "You have done a
great deal for music in Crichton, Mr.
Schöninger," she said. "You have
taught our musicians, and improved
the public taste immensely. Our
people are musically inclined; and
I hope the time may come when we
shall have great artists among us
who will do something besides present
the works of others. I do not
profess to be a critic, or learned in
the art; but it seems to me that it is
not yet exhausted, and that in the
way of musical declamation there is
much to be done. I have often
thought that words do not belong
with the highest kinds of music that
we have at present, with the one exception
of that wonderful <em>Miserere</em>,
which one hears in perfection only
in Rome. I would like to have a
chant or recitative style for sublime
and beautiful thoughts, so that the
words should be more prominent
than the tune, yet be delivered as one
might fancy they would be delivered
in heaven. That is the kind of
music I wish to have grow up here.
It would suit us better than the other.
It is more rapid and impetuous."</p>

<p>Mr. Schöninger half uttered a
doubtful "yes!"</p>

<p>"But art needs a warm atmosphere
and an ardent people," he added;
"and the kind of music you describe,
which is in form like improvisation,
is a failure if without enthusiasm in
the singer and the listener. Ornate
music may be sung by an almost
soulless performer so as to produce
an impression of meaning something,
because the notes tell all; but declamatory
music is a dead body, into
which a singer must breathe a soul."</p>

<p>"So much the better," she replied.
"Give the notes that tell all to the
instrument. But when the text has
great meaning, let a human voice
interpret it, without help of florid
ornamentation. But you, an artist,
are content to breathe this cold atmosphere!"</p>

<p>"I am at once contented and discontented."
His voice softened.
"For I behold at last what I want,
yet do not possess it."</p>

<p>He stopped, as if for some sign or
question; but Honora did not utter
a word. His voice, far more than
what he said, startled and silenced
her.</p>

<p>He turned gently toward her.
"Would it be possible, Miss Pembroke,
that I should find favor in
your eyes?"</p>

<p>"You are, then, a Catholic?" she
said quietly.</p>

<p>It was not necessary for her to say
any more; yet he would not yield
without a struggle, vain as it was.</p>

<p>"You exaggerate the difference
between us," he said earnestly, coming
nearer. "It is one of form
rather than meaning. If I choose
to walk by the pure, white light, and
you prefer the prismatic colors, still
both are but different conditions of
the same light, and what I adore is
the source of all that you adore.
Your Christ quoted as the greatest
of all the Commandments the very
one which is greatest to me. You
would have perfect freedom with me.
Honora, and a greater love than
words can tell."</p>

<p>"Mr. Schöninger," she exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
"can you for one instant believe
that I would be the wife of a man
who scorns as an impostor him
whom I adore as a God?"</p>

<p>"I could not scorn where you
adore," he replied. "The mistake is
not yours, and the imposture is not
his. I find him good, and noble,
and sweet, and lovely almost beyond
human loveliness. Do you forget
that he also was a Jew? All that
you see in the Son, and the saint,
and the apostle I see in God. These
beings you honor are but scattered
rays of the great Luminary. We
are not so different as we appear."</p>

<p>"You believe in the God who
created, and loved, and preserved,"
she said; "but you do not believe in
the God who loved even unto death.
My God has suffered for me. The
difference is infinite. It cannot be
set aside. The memories that pierce
my heart leave you unmoved. The
Shepherd who went in search of his
lost sheep you know nothing of.
The despised and rejected One
weeping over Jerusalem you care nothing
for. That humility, so astounding
and so touching, of a God making
himself small enough for me to
possess; what is it to you? Nothing
but a stumbling-block. Is your God
a Father in heaven?"</p>

<p>Mr. Schöninger was standing now,
and his earnestness was fully equal
to Honora's. "My God is a father,
and more than a father," he said;
"and he is pitiful to his children,
even while he afflicts them. I see in
him the beneficent Provider, who
every day for his children works
miracles greater far than those recorded
in the New Testament. He
renews the seasons, the light. Every
day is a creation. He gives us the
fruits of the earth. He lavishes
beauty everywhere to please us. He
sees men unmindful of the laws which
he wrote on the tables of their hearts,
and yet he pities and spares them.
Oh! I am talking to the wind!"</p>

<p>"It is indeed useless for us to talk
on this subject, Mr. Schöninger,"
Honora said firmly.</p>

<p>He stood a moment leaning against
the side of the window where she sat,
and looking down at her face, that
showed pale even in that dim light.
"You reject me only because I am a
Jew?" he asked. "Pardon me!" for
she had made a slight movement of
displeasure. "Do not forget that I
love you. Is that no claim on your
kindness?"</p>

<p>"I do not feel any unkindness for
you; but since you are not a Christian,
I cannot tell how I would feel
if you were one."</p>

<p>The reply sounded cold.</p>

<p>Mr. Schöninger bowed, with an
immediate resumption of ceremony.
"I have, then, only to ask your pardon
for having intruded a disagreeable
subject on you," he said. "Good-evening!"</p>

<p>She watched him going out, and
saw that at the gate he was joined
by F. Chevreuse, who was just returning
home from a sick-call.</p>

<p>"Oh! what will F. Chevreuse say
to me?" she murmured. "What
would dear Mother Chevreuse have
said to me? It is all my fault! I
had too much confidence in my own
wisdom! They were right: there
should be no intimacy with unbelievers."</p>

<p>"And so you hate creeds?" F.
Chevreuse was saying, in reply to
an exclamation of Mr. Schöninger's.
"And what of your own, pray?"</p>

<p>The Jew drew away, with a slightly
impatient gesture, when the priest
made a motion to take his arm. He
had no desire to advance a step
toward that barrier against which he
had just bruised himself. The warning,
"Thus far shalt thou go, and no
farther," was too fresh in his memory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p>"My creed," he answered, "is not
one of those inexorable ones that life
dashes men against, as the sea dashes
them on the rocks. It does not
preach charity and practise hate.
It does not set up barriers between
man and man, and treat nine-tenths
of the world as heathen. It does
not profess the most sublime reliance
on God, and then practise the most
subtle worldly wisdom. It is not
even the old Jewish belief in its formality.
That was as the roots of a
plant of which true Judaism is the
blossom. We cling to the old name,
and some cling to the old belief,
merely because it has been hated
and persecuted. If my forefathers
rejected and crucified him whom you
call the Christ, your church has excluded
and crucified my people till
they have bled at every pore. They
have been mocked, and beaten, and
spit upon; and yet you say that the
dying prayer of your Model was,
'<em>Father, forgive them, for they know
not what they do</em>.' However it may
be with individuals in your church&mdash;and
I have found them noble and
charitable&mdash;as a sect,</p>

<p class="center">"Their life laughs through, and spits at their creed."
</p>

<p>If they had practised the charity
they professed, there would not now
be an old-creed Jew in the world."</p>

<p>F. Chevreuse saw how vain it
would be to combat the man in his
present mood, and he strongly suspected
what trouble lay at the bottom
of it. Had he been less truly charitable,
he might have persuaded himself
that it was his duty to make a
counter attack or a convincing argument&mdash;a
mistake sometimes made by
people who like to think that they
are zealously indignant because God's
truth is assailed, when, in reality, there
may be a good deal of personal feeling
because some one has spoken
lightly of <em>their</em> belief. F. Chevreuse
made neither this mistake nor that
other of throwing away argument on
an excited man. The end he sought
was the glory of God in the conversion
of souls; and if, to accomplish
that, it had been necessary for him to
stand, like his divine Master, "opening
not his lips," while truth was
reviled, he would have done it.</p>

<p>"I am a better Jew than you are,
then," he said gently, and put his
arm in Mr. Schöninger's, who, in
the surprise at this unexpected tone,
did not shrink from him. "I am
proud of that ancient people of God.
In the morning of humanity, it was
the pillar of cloud which was to give
place to the pillar of fire at the gloaming
of the race. To me, all the
glorious points in their history are
literally true. Moses wears his two
beams of light; the bush burns without
being consumed; at the stroke
of a rod, water gushes from the rock,
or is piled up in a wall&mdash;it is literally
true, not a figure. But the sacrifice
was above all. Those poor exiles
from Eden were deprived of present
happiness; but they were full of
knowledge, and comforted by hope.
They were but just from the hand
of the Creator, and were more perfect
in mind and body than any
since. They had spoken face to
face with God. He condemned
them for their sin, but promised them
a Redeemer, and gave them the
sacrifice as a sign. I have always
thought that there was something
very touching in the sacrifice which
Cain and Abel offered up. They
were commemorating the sin of their
own parents. Then, see how wonderfully
that idea of an offended God
demanding a propitiatory sacrifice
clung to the human mind! The
universality of the belief would prove
its truth, if there were no other proof.
How it must have been branded on
the souls of Adam and Eve to last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
so! The race grew, and broke into
fragments that scattered far and wide.
For centuries they never met, and
they lost all memory of each other.
Their habits and their languages
changed; the faces of some grew
dark; there was scarcely a sign of
brotherhood between them. If they
met, they were as strange to each
other as the inhabitants of different
planets. Some adored one God,
some believed in many. In spiritual
matters, there was only one point
which they held in common. You
have, perhaps, seen the little <i lang="la">Agnus
Dei</i> that Catholics wear&mdash;a bit of
wax with a lamb stamped on it. Well,
sir, every soul that God sent into the
world had the sacrificial idea stamped
on it, like that lamb on the wax.
The devil blurred this image, of
course, till men fell into all sorts of
errors, and even sacrificed each
other; but he could never efface it.
The hand of God graves deeply, and
the inscription wears out the hand
that rubs it.</p>

<p>"But the Jews, my sublime spiritual
ancestors, kept the truth. They
adored the one God, Jehovah; and
by their sacrifice they were perpetually
reminding him of the Redeemer
he had promised them. It is true,
they became corrupted, and rejected
him when he came; but I do not
forget that he was a Jew, that his
first followers were Jews, and that
his Immaculate Mother was a Jewess.
I tell you, I glory in the history of
that people. It is you who throw
contempt on them, not I. Catholicism
proves and honors Judaism. If
all were false, we might then be deluded;
but the Jews would be the
deluders. We only complain of
them because they call themselves
liars. Judaism, past and present,
would fall with Catholicism, and
fall underneath. All the truth held
by the reformed Jews is a weak reflection
of the light cast by the Catholic
Church back on old Judaism.
To deny the authority of the church
is as though the moon should proclaim
herself the source of day, and
try to extinguish the sun. If it were
possible for the attempt to succeed,
the result would be an utter spiritual
darkness, followed by barbarism.
Christ is the light of the world; and
all the light there was in the world
before his coming was like the morning
light before the sun touches the
horizon. The patriarchs and the
prophets were the planets and the
moon of the spiritual system; they
saw him afar off, and told of him.
Strange inconsistency! Men usually
laugh at prophecies till they are
fulfilled, then pay them a retrospective
homage; but in this, they bow
to the prophecy till the instant of
its fulfilment, then reject and scorn
both together. If you believed in
Christ, all your altars would blaze
up again, making a spiral circle of
fire from the creation to the redemption.
He rounds the circle. '<em>I am
the beginning and the end</em>,' he says."</p>

<p>Whether he perceived or acknowledged
any truth in what he heard,
or not, it certainly had the effect of
making Mr. Schöninger ashamed of
his ill-temper.</p>

<p>"I have to apologize, sir," he said,
"for having made a personal attack
instead of using argument, and for
having acted like a whipped school-boy.
My only excuse is that I was
smarting under punishment. I am
usually just enough to judge a principle
by itself, not by its upholders."</p>

<p>They had now reached the step of
the priest's house, and paused there,
Mr. Schöninger declining mutely a
mute invitation to enter.</p>

<p>"That is a point&mdash;that relating to
persons&mdash;which we will discuss some
other time, when we both feel more
like it," F. Chevreuse said. "But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
my friend," he added, with impassioned
earnestness, "let the faults of
individuals, and communities, and
nations go. They are irrelevant.
Let God be true, though all men
may be false. <i lang="la">Ecce Agnus Dei!</i> If a
haughty conqueror should demand
your submission, I could understand
why you would feel like rebelling.
But here there is nothing but love to
resist. Here there is only infinite
sweetness and humility. Did he
ever persecute you? Did he ever
revile you? He wept over you.
'O Jerusalem, Jerusalem!'"</p>

<p>Standing on his own threshold, the
priest suddenly put his arm around
the Jew's shoulder. "Love him,
then hate whom you can. Love
him, and do what you will," he said.
"I don't ask you to listen to the
church, to listen to me, to listen to
any one, but only to behold the Lamb
of God. Look at him, study him,
listen to him. O my God! that I had
the tongue of an angel! I love you!
I am longing for your conversion, but
I cannot say a word. Good-night!
May God bless you and speak to
you!"</p>

<p>The Jew was alone, overpowered
by the sudden and tender passion of
that appeal, feeling still the pressure
of that more than brotherly embrace.
If his mind had recognized any truth,
he did not at the moment perceive
or think of it, so moved was his
heart at the vision of love that had
been opened to him. If divine love
was added to the human, he did not
inquire; he only knew that the
priest was sincere, and was at that
moment on his knees praying for
him. He would have liked to go in
and beg his blessing, not, perhaps, as
that of a priest, but as that of an
incomparably good and loving man.</p>

<p>He checked the impulse, though
it led him so far as to extend his
hand to open the door.</p>

<p>Ah! if we did but yield to generous
and affectionate impulses as we
yield to bad ones, how much happier
the world would be! How often
they are checked by distrust of
others or of ourselves, or by the petty
fear of being unconventional, when,
if followed, they might warm a little
this cold human atmosphere, in which
we stand so frozen that one might
almost expect our fingers to rattle
like icicles when we shake hands.</p>

<p>But though Mr. Schöninger did
not go in, neither did he turn carelessly
away. We wonder if any of
our readers will understand how
much affection was expressed in
what he did. It was a trifling act,
apparently. He laid his right hand,
palm forward, against the door, and
let it press the panel a moment.
From some it might not mean much,
but this man never gave his hand
lightly, nor used it lightly; and it
was one of those hands which seem
to contain in themselves the whole
person. It was a hand with a heart
in it; and while it rested there, his
face wore an expression more tender
than a smile, as if he gave both a
benediction and a caress to all within
those walls for the sake of one who
dwelt there. Then he turned away,
and walked slowly down the street.</p>

<p>Mr. Schöninger was essentially and
sufficiently manly. If the long pursuit
of money had been dry and
distasteful to him, he had made no
complaint of the necessity, even to
himself. That which must be done
he attempted and carried out as best
he might, feeling, it may be, a certain
pleasure in exercising his will; perceiving,
also, a goal ahead where
such sordid strife would end. It
may be that even in the fascinating
and delightful exercise of his art, there
had still been a sense of something
lacking; for the artist is, above all
things, human, and this man was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
alone; but he made no sentimental
moan. The want, if it had a voice,
was never listened to. It was only
now, in the moment of a sharp and
bitter pain that had cleft his heart,
and a soothing sweetness that had
fallen on the wound like an unguent,
that he realized how utterly without
sympathy his life had been, and how
all that had made it tolerable had
been a looking forward to something
better. He was like one who, wandering
long in a frozen desert, sees
unexpectedly the warm, red hearth-light
shining toward his feet. It was
not his home-light, but another's;
yet it touched him so that his heart
woke up with a cry, and demanded
something in the present, and could
no longer be satisfied with a vague
expectation.</p>

<p>He was angry with himself that he
had not refrained from speaking to
Miss Pembroke, or that, having spoken,
he had not been more persistent.
He would not believe that he could
give so much and receive no return;
and it seemed to him certain that by
waiting he could at least have succeeded
so far as to render it impossible
for her to refuse him without a
regret too great for concealment.
That was all he now thought attainable,
and, in comparison to what he
had, it appeared to him happiness.
That is a cruelty without which no
love can exist; it demands the power
to make its object unhappy in parting,
if it is denied the privilege of
making it happy in union.</p>

<p>"I was a fool!" he muttered, tossing
the hair back from his burning
face and head. "I took my refusal
as promptly as though I had asked
for a flower. A woman who is
ready with her confession of love at
the first word of asking must have
expected and prepared herself for the
proposal. Even a profound affection
may be a little hidden from her
till after it is asked for, though visible
to others. Besides, she sometimes
draws back from timidity, or to
see if a man is really in earnest.
That proposal which he foresees and
intends takes her by surprise, and,
even when willing to advance, her
instinct is to retreat at first. How
inconsistent we are to expect and
require that shrinking modesty in a
woman, and then complain of her
for it!"</p>

<p>He wandered on through street
after street, glancing at the lighted
windows of many a city home. In
some houses, the curtains had been
pleasantly left up, and he could see
the charming tableau of a family
gathered about the evening lamp.
They read or sewed, raising their
faces now and then to smile at each
other; they conversed, or they rested,
leaning back in their chairs.</p>

<p>Coming to a secluded little cottage
in a quiet street, he leaned on
the garden fence, and looked into the
sitting-room. He was acquainted
with the people there; they met him
pleasantly in public, but it had never
occurred to them, apparently, to
invite him to their home. All his
friends, indeed, were of that public
kind.</p>

<p>The room was lighted by a shaded
lamp that made a bright circle on
the table under it. A man sat at
one side sketching what a nearer
view would have shown to be a
Holy Family. Now and then he
lifted his head and gazed at the
group opposite him, the models of
his Mother and Child; and the expression
of his fine, spiritual face
showed how his soul strove to fan
that visible spark of human affection
into a flaming vision of divine love.</p>

<p>The woman sat weaving bright
wools into some fleecy shape, her
slight fingers flying as the work progressed
under them. Her eyes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
downcast, and a faint smile shone
on her happy face. One foot kept
in gentle motion a cradle, wherein a
babe slept, its rosy little hands curled
up under its chin, like closed
flowers. Now and then the mother
bent above the sleeper, seemed to
hover over it, like a bird over its
nest, when the drapery her artist-husband
had arranged on her hair
would drop forward and hide her
profile from him. Once, when he
wanted an outline, he stretched his
arm, drew her face round by the
chin, and seemed playfully to chide
her excessive baby-worship. But it
seemed that the soft, blue fold had
hidden something more than a mere
loving gaze; for a tear slipped from
the brown lashes as they appeared.
She clasped the chiding hand in
hers, and uttered a few words.</p>

<p>How well the looker-on outside
could guess what sad thought had
called up that tear! She had feared
that her happiness was too great to
last.</p>

<p>The husband's answer was, evidently,
cheerful and reassuring; and
soon the work and the drawing went
on, and the smiles were restored.</p>

<p>Recollecting himself, Mr. Schöninger
continued his walk. What had
he to do with such scenes? He
was as shut out from all intimate
friendships as though he had been
invisible to those about him. If he
should be ill, the doctor and the hired
nurse would take care of him;
if he should die, strangers would
bury him, without pity and without
grief; and his possessions in Crichton,
such little belongings as friends
cherish when those they love are
gone, would be tossed about and
prized only at their money value.</p>

<p>Never had he felt more despondent.
The momentary pleasure derived
from the friendship of F. Chevreuse
faded away like sunlight from rocks,
leaving only hard and sombre facts
behind. There never could be a
real friendship between him and the
priest. An insurmountable obstacle
separated them.</p>

<p>This solitary walk brought to his
mind one night, months past, when
he had walked the streets of Crichton,
as solitary and wretched as now, from
evening till daybreak. "I will not
think of it!" he muttered, and cast
the recollection aside. "O my
God! who shall pray for me, who
cannot pray for myself?"</p>

<p>A sound of singing caught his ear.
He was passing a Protestant church,
where they were holding an evening
meeting, and they were singing a
plain chant, with only a thread of
accompaniment. It sounded tuneful
and earnest, and he stepped into the
vestibule to listen.</p>

<p>They sang:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Hear, Father, hear our prayer!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wandering unknown in the land of the stranger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be with all trav'lers in sickness or danger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guard thou their path, guide their feet from the snare.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Hear, Father, hear our prayer!"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Some one was praying for him
without being aware of it! There
was in the world a charity which
stretched out beyond the familiar, and
touched the unknown sufferer.</p>

<p>As he was leaving the vestibule,
he noticed two men, one standing at
either side, on the steps without the
door. Rather annoyed at being found
in such a place, he passed them
hastily, and went on. When he
thought himself free from them, his
memory went back to that prayerful
strain:</p>

<p class="center">"Guard thou their steps, guide their feet from the snare."
</p>

<p>Yes, they were praying for him, these
strangers, who had seemed so alien.</p>

<p>Presently he became aware that
he was not free from the persons
who had been observing him at the
church door. The steps of two men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
were following him. He quickened his
pace, and they also quickened theirs.
He went into a side street, and perceived
that they were still on his
track. There was no escape. His
feet had not been guided from the
snare. A chilly sensation passed
over him, which might be either anger
or fear. He paused one instant,
then turned and faced his pursuers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next morning, after Mass,
Honora Pembroke went in to see F.
Chevreuse, waiting in the church till
she thought he had taken his breakfast.</p>

<p>"I did not see you at communion
this morning," he said, after greeting
her pleasantly. "Why was that,
young woman?"</p>

<p>They were in the sitting-room that
had belonged to Mother Chevreuse.
Her son now occupied these rooms,
and all the little tokens of a woman's
presence had disappeared. No work-basket,
with shining needles and
thimble, glittered in the sunlight; no
shawl nor scarf lay over any chair-back;
no flower nor leaf adorned the
place. All the grace had gone.</p>

<p>Honora perceived, by the momentary
clouding of the priest's face, that
he understood the glance she had
cast about the room and the involuntary
sigh that had followed it, and
she hastily recalled her thoughts.</p>

<p>"I am an unfortunate sister of
Proserpine," she said. "Some one
sent me a pomegranate yesterday as
a rarity; and this morning, while I
was dressing, and thinking of my
communion too, I ate two or three
of the seeds."</p>

<p>"You are a careless girl!" F. Chevreuse
exclaimed, with that pretence
of playful scolding which shows so
much real kindness. "But, fortunately,
your banishment is not so long as
that of your Greek sister was."</p>

<p>"I was not thinking without distraction,"
Honora continued. "There
was something else on my mind,
or I should have remembered my
fast. On the whole, I am rather
glad that I could not go to communion
this morning, for I was not so
quiet as I ought to be. I have come
to tell you about it." A faint blush
flitted over her face. She looked up
for the encouraging nod and "Yes!"
which were not wanting, and then
told half her story in a sentence:
"Mr. Schöninger told me last night
that he thinks a great deal of me."</p>

<p>F. Chevreuse nodded again, and did
not look quite so much astonished as
she had expected him to be.</p>

<p>The other and most troublesome
part of the story followed immediately,
breathed out with a kind of terror:
"And after I had refused him,
and he had left the room, and walked
away with you, I felt pained, not
for him, but for myself. I almost
wanted to call him back; though, if
he had come, I should have been
sorry. I do not understand it."</p>

<p>She looked like one who expects a
severe sentence, and scarcely drew
breath till the answer came.</p>

<p>The priest spoke quite carelessly:
"Oh! it is natural that we should
feel a kind of regret in refusing an
offering meant to be good, though it
may not be good to us. You need not
accuse yourself of that. Of course,
you are not going to marry a Jew,
nor to wish to marry one. That is
out of the question. And there is no
need of searching too scrupulously
into those vague and complicated
emotions which are for ever troubling
the human heart. It will only confuse
the mind and sully the conscience.
They are like mists that
float over the sky. Keep your eyes
steadily fixed on the Day-star, and
do not fear an occasional waft of
scud. As long as the star shines, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
is well. When you no longer see it,
then is the time to fear."</p>

<p>Honora looked relieved, but not altogether
satisfied. "But must there
not have been some fault in me, when
1 could feel even the slightest regret
in rejecting one who has rejected
God?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I have but to repeat what I have
said," was the answer. "You need
not disturb yourself about the matter.
Dismiss it from your mind, except
so far as it is necessary for you
to think in order to conduct yourself
properly toward him in future. I
take for granted that your intercourse
must be a little more reserved than
it has been."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes," she exclaimed. "I
would rather not see him any more.
And there was my fault, father. I
have been very presumptuous. Both
Mrs. Gerald and dear Mother Chevreuse
were dissatisfied to have me
associate with him. I could see that,
though they said nothing. But I
fancied that I was more liberal than
they, and that I could decide perfectly
well for myself. I had almost
a mind to be displeased with them
for wishing to keep him at a distance,
as if they were uncharitable. Now
I am punished, and I know that I
deserve it."</p>

<p>"Oh! well," the priest said gently,
his face growing thoughtful and
sad at the allusion to his mother.
"We all make mistakes; and to persons
who wish to be generous,
but have not much experience, prudence
seems a very cold virtue,
sometimes almost a vice. But believe
me, my child, it is possible for
really kind and generous feelings to
lead to results far worse than even an
excess of prudence might have caused.
Don't distress yourself! Only
have a care of going too far in either
way."</p>

<p>Their talk was here interrupted by
a ring of the door-bell so unusually
loud as to betoken an excited visitor.</p>

<p>"A sick-call," said F. Chevreuse.</p>

<p>They heard Jane open the door;
then a light step ran through the
entry, and, without any ceremony of
knocking, Miss Lily Carthusen burst
into the room.</p>

<p>"O F. Chevreuse!" she cried,
"Mr. Schöninger is in jail."</p>

<p>The priest looked at her without
comprehending, and also without
speaking. When sudden and terrible
news have come upon us once,
casting us to the earth, as though by
a thunder-stroke, any startling address
awakens in us ever after something
of the same terror and distress.</p>

<p>Jane had followed Miss Carthusen
to the sitting-room door, and, the
moment she heard her announcement,
broke out into exclamations:
"I knew it! I have known it all the
time! O poor Mother Chevreuse!"</p>

<p>F. Chevreuse stood up, as if to
take freer breath, and his face grew
crimson.</p>

<p>"In what way does this arrest
concern me particularly, Miss Carthusen?"
he asked, striving to speak
calmly.</p>

<p>"F. Chevreuse, cannot you
guess?" she returned. "Many others
have suspected, if you have not. I
believed it almost from the first."</p>

<p>"I do not believe it!" he exclaimed,
and began to pace the room. "I
will not believe it! It is impossible!"
And then, whether believing
or not in this accusation, he felt
anew the whole force of that terrible
blow. "O mother, mother!" he cried,
and burst into tears.</p>

<p>"I suspected him on account of
the shawl," Miss Carthusen went on.
"His has not been seen in the house
since that day; and...."</p>

<p>F. Chevreuse was leaning up
against the wall, with his face hidden
in his arm; but he recovered his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
self-possession immediately, and put
a stop to these revelations. "Say no
more!" There was a certain severity
both in his voice and gesture. "I
do not wish to hear any surmises nor
particulars. I should suppose that
some person in authority ought to
bring me this information. But I
thank you for taking the trouble; and
perhaps you will be so kind as to
stop at Mr. Macon's door on your
way home, and ask him to come to
me. He cannot have gone out yet.
I would like to see him at once."</p>

<p>The young lady had no choice.
She was obliged to go.</p>

<p>Mr. Macon was, in fact, already
on his way to the house; and soon
the story received authoritative confirmation.</p>

<p>"He did not seem to be at all surprised,
sir," said the officer who had
made the arrest. "He is a very
cool sort of man on the outside;
though I would not have liked to go
after him alone."</p>

<p>"Did he say anything?" demanded
the priest.</p>

<p>"Not a word!"</p>

<p>"Did not he ask to see me?"</p>

<p>"No, sir!"</p>

<p>The face of F. Chevreuse darkened
with perplexity and disappointment.
After what had occurred
between them the night before, if the
man had trusted him then, and if he
were innocent, surely he would have
sent for him at once.</p>

<p>"When I have said that I love
him," he thought, "how could he
suffer me to rest a moment in ignorance
of what had happened, or to
wait for his assurance? Or does his
very silence prove his trust in me
and confidence in his own acquittal?
Well, even if it does, I prefer a confidence
that speaks."</p>

<p>He looked the officer steadily in
the face. "Sir," he said with emphasis,
"I wish every one to understand
that I believe this accusation
to be a mistake, and that I regret
it exceedingly. I shall go to see
Mr. Schöninger, if I am permitted,
and say the same to him. And
now, gentlemen, if there is nothing
more necessary to be said, will you
spare me the saying anything unnecessary
on the subject?"</p>

<p>Jane had been trying to talk to
Miss Pembroke, who put her back
gently, without answering a word;
and as soon as their visitors had
withdrawn, she approached F. Chevreuse,
and attempted to finish the
story which Miss Carthusen had begun.
But he stopped her even more
peremptorily than he had done the
other.</p>

<p>"That young lady is not a Catholic,"
he said, "but you are. Do
not forget charity. You have no
right to hold any person guilty till
his guilt is proved, and even then
you should not rejoice over his
condemnation. I forbid your saying
any more on this subject to me
or any other person, except when
you are questioned in court. I am
displeased at the spirit you have
shown."</p>

<p>Jane withdrew, convicted, and,
perhaps, a little indignant.</p>

<p>Then F. Chevreuse looked at
Honora Pembroke. She had sat
perfectly pale and silent through it
all. "Can you go home without
assistance, child?" he asked.</p>

<p>She understood his wish to be
alone, and rose with an effort. "I
am not faint; I am horrified," she
said. "It is a monstrous injustice.
I wish you would come to us by-and-by."
She looked at him imploringly.</p>

<p>"I will go to Mrs. Gerald's directly
after having seen him," he promised.</p>

<p>When he was alone, F. Chevreuse
locked the door, and began to pace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
the room, tears running down his
cheeks. "O my sweet mother!"
he said, "so it's all to be dragged up
again, and your dear name associated
with all that is cruel and wicked in
crime!"</p>

<p>He opened a closet, and took
down a little faded plaid shawl that
his mother had used for years to
throw over her shoulders in the
house when the air was chilly. It
hung on the nail where she had left
it; and while he held it at arm's
length, and looked at it, her form
seemed to rise up before him. He
saw the wide, motherly shoulders, the
roll of thick, gray hair, the face faintly
smiling and radiantly loving.
And then he could see nothing; for
the tears gushed forth so passionately
as to wash away both vision and
reality.</p>

<h3>SPIRITUALISM.</h3>


<h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>


<p>Before considering the merits of
the third hypothesis for accounting
for the phenomena of spiritualism, I
propose to draw out at some length
the church theory of magic and formal
diabolic interference.</p>

<p>Magic, in the sense of a systematized
use of and intercourse with the
spiritual world by other means than
authorized prayer and ritual, has
been an idea familiar to all races and
to all times. Its hostile or consciously
diabolical character has depended
upon the vividness with which it has
appreciated the nature of God and
his sanction of the religion which it
is confronting, and upon its consequent
inability to regard itself as an
appendix to, rather than a contradiction
of, religion. Hence, it has been
peculiarly virulent when it has had
to manœuvre in the face of the precise
enunciations of Catholicism, as
was the case in mediæval Christendom;
whilst, on the other hand, in a
system of tolerant eclecticism like
that of pagan Rome or modern America,
it has naturally adopted a milder
form.</p>

<p>The accounts given of the origin
of magic in pagan and rabbinical tradition
are almost identical, and read
much like a rude allegory of Christian
theology. In the first, the fair
and proud Lamia, beloved of Zeus, in
revenge for being herself ousted and
her children slain by Hera, takes general
vengeance upon the subjects of
Zeus. In. the second, Lilith, Adam's
first wife, is ever seeking to destroy
the children of her successful rival,
Eve. According to the more common
Catholic teaching, sundry of the
angels, God's first creation, destined
to be the first partners of his bliss,
fell for resisting God's designs in behalf
of his second creation, man,
whose nature he was to espouse in the
Incarnation; whence the devil's hatred
of the children of men.</p>

<p>The fathers<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> considered that the
rebel angels first taught men magic
in the evil days before the Flood, and
that the seeds of the black art were
carried on into the new world by
Cham. His grandson, Mesraim, or
Zoroaster, was said to have used it
extensively to give life and reality to
the false worship which was his legacy
to his children, the Egyptians,
Babylonians, and Persians.</p>

<p>The worship of the hosts of heaven&mdash;the
sun, moon, and stars&mdash;would
seem to have been the earliest form
of false worship, and all mythological
research tends to show that this
is, in fact, the core even of those cults
which at first sight would seem most
unlike it. The Persians were fire-worshippers,
but fire was stolen from
heaven; and one of the miracles recorded
of Zoroaster was his drawing
magic sparks from the stars. The
name given him by his disciples was
"the Living Star." The host of deities
with which the Greek and Roman
world was peopled, many of whom
would at first sight suggest a purely
terrestrial origin, for the most part
group themselves round central figures,
which, on examination, prove to
be earthly reflections of astral influences&mdash;of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
the sun or moon gods and
their supposed satellites.</p>

<p>According to the fathers, magic
was the very life and soul of idolatry,
and pagan worship was regarded
as a union of conventional deception
and diabolic energy, the one or
other element predominating according
to circumstances. Thus <em>diablerie</em>
lay beneath such orderly institutions
as, for instance, the national cultus
of ancient Rome, like the volcanic
fires of Vesuvius under the rich vineyards
which they have in part created
and for a while sustain.</p>

<p>But whilst it is to a great extent
true that paganism was substantially
little better than an organized <em>diablerie</em>,
and the devil, as the strong
man in the Gospel, was keeping his
house in comparative peace, still the
very elements of man's nature, despite
his fall, did in various ways
protest against the enemy and impede
his action. The idea of a supreme
God could not be wholly
withdrawn from the minds and hearts
of men, and many true prayers, despite
the demon's elaborate machinery
to intercept them, pierced the
heavens. Nay, the very forms themselves
of idolatry would often suggest
thoughts and acts of worship
which no evil influence could control;
for the world had been given to
men, and not to the demon. Even
the senses, for all they were so many
inlets of temptation, did, by bringing
men under the wholesome influence
of external nature, and by their equable
excitation of his mental powers,
tend, in fact, to break the fascinating
grasp which the fiend would hold
upon his imagination. The material
world at once spoke to him of God,
and housed him from the pitiless
storm of spiritual influence with
which he was assailed. Common
sense was not without its power of
natural exorcism, and true affection
often grew and flowered where the
devil only thought to have nurtured
lust.</p>

<p>In the cults which express the
religious sentiments of the more
civilized nations, we meet with much
that is humane and noble, whilst, at
the same time, we are often shocked
by manifestations of a very different
character&mdash;rites in which the fire of
the pit seems to have found a direct
vent.</p>

<p>On the whole, in pre-Christian, as
compared with Christian, times, the
devil reigned. When the apostle
would warn the faithful of the foes
with whom they would have to contend,
he says: "Our warfare is not
against flesh and blood"&mdash;<em>i.e.</em> these
are, under the circumstances, hardly
worth considering&mdash;"but against
principalities and powers; against the
rulers of the world of this darkness;
against spiritual wickedness in high
places." It was by the direct onslaught
of the early church upon the citadel
of paganism&mdash;her forcing the devil,
by the intolerable brightness of her
presence, to show himself in his true
colors&mdash;and by thus enlisting on her
side all the more honest elements of
human nature, that she gained the
victory, and the devil was fairly outlawed.
In the expressive language
of the Theodosian Codex (ix. tit.
xvi.), sorcerers are denounced as
"aliens of nature," (<i lang="la">peregrini naturæ</i>).
Still, for all this, the war was
by no means over, and its character
remained substantially what it had
always been. The devil did not lose
his power of working marvels, but,
as in the case of Pharaoh's magicians,
he was outdone and baffled.</p>

<p>I think there will be little difficulty
in showing that the teaching
of the church on the subject of the
devil's power was in the earliest
times substantially what it was in the
middle ages and what it is now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
The contrary has been maintained
by Janus, and we must do him the
justice to acknowledge that even
reputable writers like Maffei and
Cantù have gone some lengths in
the same direction. As Janus is
still quoted as an authority in this
country, it will not be amiss to combine
his refutation with the illustration
of my subject.</p>

<p>Janus maintains in so many words
that in the Christian Church "it
was long looked upon as a wicked
and unchristian error, as something
heretical, to attribute supernatural
powers and effects to the aid of demons";
that "for many
centuries ... the popular notions
about diabolical agency, nocturnal
meetings with demons, enchantments
and witchcrafts, were viewed
and treated as a folly inconsistent
with Christian belief"; that this
doctrine continued until gradually
ousted by the "threefold authority
of the popes, Aquinas, and
the powerful Dominican Order."<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
Now, I of course admit that the
action taken by the authorities of
the church in regard to particular
phenomena of witchcraft has varied
extremely with circumstances; but
she has always held that the devil
has the power, which he is sometimes
allowed to exercise, either <i lang="fr">en
rapport</i> with human agents or independently
of them, of working marvels
which transcend the natural
power of the particular nature in
conjunction with which they are
wrought, though not transcending
the sphere of universal nature; and
that these are done by rapid, imperceptible
combinations of other
natural powers. When theologians
disputed as to whether the devil
could do this or that particular
marvel&mdash;for example, transport imprisoned
witches through their prison-walls
to the "Sabbath"&mdash;the dispute
did not turn on the reality
or non-reality of magic, but upon
whether the marvel in question did
or did not transcend the sphere
of universal nature. On the
other hand, theologians have always
maintained that in a certain
sense witchcraft is an absurdity,
no craft at all, an <i lang="la">ars nugatoria</i>,
as S. Thomas calls it, since it is
founded upon no fixed principles,
but depends for its issues on the
free will of one who has been a
deceiver from the beginning. The
scholastics made a great point of
insisting upon the essentially unscientific
character of witchcraft,
since the devil had taken advantage
of the extraordinary thirst for
learning which prevailed in the middle
ages to present himself in the
light of a guide to new realms of
science.</p>

<p>Janus relies for the justification of
his statement upon a document long
known as a chapter of the Council of
Ancyra, but generally acknowledged
to be the utterance of some IXth
century Frank council. I subjoin
it at length, together with the kindred
questions from the <cite>Penitentiary</cite>
of Burchard. Over and above their
controversial value, they have an
antiquarian interest which I hope
not to neglect:</p>

<p>"Neither must this be passed over,
that certain wicked women, turning
back after Satan, and seduced by
the illusions and phantasms of demons,
believe and profess that they
ride by night with Diana, goddess of
the pagans, or with Herodias and a
countless multitude of women, upon
certain beasts, and silently, and in
the dead of night, traverse many
lands, obeying her commands as
their mistress, and were, on certain
nights, summoned to do her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
service. And would that these
only had perished in their faithlessness!
for an innumerable multitude,
deceived by this false opinion, believe
these things to be true, and, so
believing, deviate from the true faith,
and relapse into the errors of paganism,
in believing that aught divine
and godlike can be besides God.
Wherefore, priests in the churches
under their charge should preach to
the people with all earnestness, so
that they may understand that these
things are, in all respects, false, and
that such phantasms are injected
into the minds of the faithful, not by
the spirit of God, but by the evil
spirit.</p>

<p>"Verily, Satan himself, who transfigures
himself into an angel of light,
after seizing upon the mind of some
silly woman, and subjugating her to
himself by infidelity, thereupon transforms
himself into the forms and
semblances of various persons, and
in dreams deceiving the mind which
he holds in captivity, and showing
it anon pleasant things, anon sad,
anon known, anon unknown, leads
it everywhere from the road; and
whilst the spirit alone undergoes this,
the unfaithful mind thinks that this
is taking place, not in the soul, but in
the body? But who, in dreams and
visions of the night, is not carried
out of himself, and does not see
many things in his sleep which he
had never seen awake? yet who is
so silly and stupid as to think that
all these things which take place in
the spirit only, occur also in the
body? seeing that Ezechiel the prophet
saw the visions of the Lord in
the spirit, and not in the body, and
the Apostle John saw the mystery of
the Apocalypse in the spirit, not in
the body. 'At once,' he saith, 'I was
in the spirit'; and Paul dared not
say that he had been taken out of
the body. Wherefore, all must be
told that whosoever believes these
things and the like loses the faith,
and he who hath not the right faith
in the Lord is not the Lord's, but
his in whom he believes&mdash;that is, the
devil's; for of our Lord it is written,
'By him all things were made.'
Whoever, then, believes that it can
happen that a creature should be
changed into a better or a worse, or
be transformed into another sort or
species save by the Creator who
made all things, and through whom
all things were made, of a surety is
an infidel, and worse than a pagan."</p>

<p>The following are passages from
what Burchard transcribes as an ancient
<cite>Roman Penitentiary</cite>, and are
specimens of a practical application
of the preceding chapter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Hast thou ever believed or taken
part in the perfidious credence that enchanters
and those that call themselves
storm-senders can, by the enchantment
of demons, excite storms or alter men's
minds? If thou hast believed or taken
part, thou shalt do penance for one year
on the lawful Ferias.</p>

<p>"Hast thou believed or taken part in
the credence that there be women who,
by certain charms or incantations, can
change men's minds, that is to say, from
hatred to love, or from love to hatred, or
can injure or abstract men's goods by
their charms? If thou hast believed or
been partaker, one year, etc.</p>

<p>"Hast thou believed that there be women
who can do this, according to the
saying of certain women beguiled by the
devil, who maintain that they must of
necessity and of precept so do&mdash;that is to
say, must ride upon certain beasts, with a
great multitude of fiends transformed into
the semblance of women, which the foolish
call <em>Holda</em>, and have been bound in fellowship
with them? If thou hast been
partaker in that belief, one year, etc."</p></div>

<p>The following points have to be
considered in estimating the controversial
value of this chapter as used
by Janus: 1st. How far do its
enunciations necessarily represent the
theology of the universal church?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
2d. Do the beliefs which the chapter
condemns, or do they not, involve
something more than the attribution
of "supernatural powers and effects
to the aid of demons"? As to the
first, this chapter is no utterance of a
council representing the church universal;
for, even supposing it really
to belong to the Council of Ancyra,
this was not a general council. But,
as Janus admits, the chapter is first
quoted without any title by the Benedictine,
Regino, Abbot of Prumium,
in the diocese of Treves, who wrote
about 906. It was first called a
canon of Ancyra by Burchard, another
Benedictine (1020), who extracted
it from Regino's collection,
and inadvertently headed it with
the title belonging to another passage.
There is no trace to be found
of it in the early MSS. of either the
Greek or Latin acts of the Council
of Ancyra. It is not to be met with
in any collection of canons previous
to the XIth century. Baluze was no
doubt right in suggesting that it was
part of some old Frank capitulary as
yet undiscovered.</p>

<p>Janus<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> says that Regino compiled
the chapter in question from passages
in the pseudo-Augustinian writing,
<cite>De Spiritu et Anima</cite>&mdash;a sufficiently
remarkable statement, if we consider
that Regino wrote early in the Xth
century, and that the <cite>De Spiritu et
Anima</cite>, which contains passages from
S. Bernard and Hugo of S. Victor,
was certainly not composed before the
XIIth century.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>But, it may be urged, on the
strength of the passages from Burchard's
<cite>Roman Penitentiary</cite>, the Roman
Church had given its sanction to
this chapter, and had embodied it in
its practice, even before Burchard had
assigned it its imposing title. To
this I reply that the brothers Ballerini<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
produce an XIth century MS.
of a <cite>Roman Penitentiary</cite> (Vatican
Codex, 3830) identical with Burchard's,
save that it is without certain
passages, and among them this
very interrogatory on magic. The
Ballerini remark that the expression,
"were-wolf," which occurs in a passage
of the interrogatory which I have
not quoted, evidently marks it as belonging
to some local German council.
I may add that the expression,
"Holda," indubitably indicates the
same nationality; Holda, or Holle,
being the wandering moon-goddess
of the Teutons.</p>

<p>As to the second point, the beliefs
condemned clearly involve something
more than the attribution of
supernatural power to the devil&mdash;viz.,
the acknowledgment that there
is something "divine and godlike beside
the one God"; whence it follows
that the fiend can exercise his power
independently of God; can force the
wills of men to his service "by necessity
and precept"; and can change
one thing into another wholly different.
Now, all these points have
been persistently condemned by the
church of all ages. That this is the
one admissible interpretation of the
chapter will become more and more
evident as we examine the teaching
of previous and contemporaneous
theology.</p>

<p>If it be urged that, anyhow, this
chapter represents a more civilized
legislation, one more consonant in its
wise leniency with the sentiments of
to-day, than that which prevailed in
the last half of the middle ages, and,
indeed, for some centuries longer, I
must remind my readers that I have
been engaged in refuting a specific
allegation of Janus, to the effect that
the theology of the church had undergone
a substantial change on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
subject of witchcraft. I admit, of
course, fully that the system which
prevailed for some centuries in church
and state was calculated by its extravagant
severity to provoke the evil
it was intended to repress. This has
been often admitted by Catholic
writers. Cardinal de Cusa, in the
first half of the XVth century, when
legate <i lang="la">a latere</i> in the German Empire,
used these weighty words:
"Where men believe that these
witchcrafts do produce their effect,
there are found many witches; neither
can they be exterminated by fire and
sword; for the more diligently this
sort of persecution is waged, so much
the stronger grows the delusion; for
the persecution argues that the devil
is feared more than God, and that, in
the midst of the wicked, he can work
evil; and so the devil is feared and
propitiated, and thus gains his end;
and though, according to human law
and divine sanction, they deserve to
be utterly extirpated, yet we must
act cautiously and with great prudence,
lest worse come of it."<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> He
goes on to say that he himself examined
two witches, and found them
to be half mad. He shut them up,
and made them do penance. The
name of the Westphalian Jesuit, F.
Spee (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1631), is identified with
the relaxation of the penalties against
witches, as completely as that of
Wilberforce with the abolition of
slavery, or that of Howard with the
reformation of prisons; although he
was unable to accept the rationalist
thesis, "It is impossible for one
person to influence another, except
through sensible mediums; and the
devil is an absurdity." The rationalist
text is, no doubt, the sovereignest
remedy on earth for cruelty to
witches; but in the same sense is the
tenet, "All worship is absurd," the
most effectual bar to idolatry; and
there are other less costly remedies.
Whatever may be said on the score
of prudence, it cannot be denied that
such witches as deliberately produced
fatal mischief by acting upon the excited
imaginations of their victims
were justly put to death, and that
the formal transference of allegiance
from Christ to the devil was formal
high treason against the constitution
of Christendom. Abuses of justice
had no doubt crept into local practice,
such as that of putting the possessed
person&mdash;that is to say, the
devil within him&mdash;into the witness-box,
in order to discover the witch.
This arose from the delusion that the
devil might, by certain formulas, be
bound over to speak the truth. It is
vehemently denounced by all the
standard writers on the subject&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>
Delrio and Carena. Pegna (<cite>De Cffic.
Inquis.</cite>, pars ii. tit. xii. §§ 26
and 27) points out that the Roman
inquisition, contrary to the practice
elsewhere, has always refused to submit
a witch to the question on the
evidence of a companion, or to accept
the testimony of one witch as to
another's presence at the "Sabbath,"
because of the great likelihood of delusion.
Indeed, Rome seems to have
been always comparatively just and
moderate in her practice, and often
singularly lenient. It was such specimens
of provincial ecclesiasticism as
the Spanish inquisition, in which the
secular interest had the lion's share,
that went furthest in active persecution;
and these, again, in their cruel
persecution of witches, as the learned
editor of <cite>Hudibras</cite>, Dr. Zachary
Grey, confesses, the sectaries of England
and Scotland "much exceeded."<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
Perhaps this was owing to
their still further separation from the
centre of Christendom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>The arguments against execution
for witchcraft of Spee and De Cusa
come pretty much to this: 1st. The
imaginations of these unhappy people
are in such a condition that you
cannot make out how much is reality,
how much delusion, nor, again,
how far they are free agents. 2d.
The whole subject is one on which
people's imaginations are so excitable,
and imagination has so large
a share in the productions of witchcraft,
that fire-and-sword persecution
breeds more mischief than it
destroys.</p>

<p>If ever a belief in the substantial
reality of spiritualism becomes established
as of old, and&mdash;as will inevitably
happen&mdash;spiritualism is used, not
merely for amusement, but for mischief,
the champions of civilization
may be glad to avail themselves of
these almost forgotten Catholic arguments
against persecution.</p>

<p>This so-called chapter of Ancyra
is so interesting an exhibition of the
blending of classical and mediæval
<em>diablerie</em> that I shall make no apology
for interposing a detailed examination
of its mythology. It will
subserve my argument against Janus,
by bringing out the idolatrous,
and so far unreal, element of magic
as that which naturally presented itself
to the early church as the object
of its denunciations.</p>

<p>Diana (Dia Jana) was one of the
deities of ancient Latium; although
a Latin federal temple was erected
to her by Servius Tullius on the
Aventine Hill, she never took any
very high rank amongst the divinities
of Rome, but remained the special
patron of slaves and rustics&mdash;that is
to say, the immediate cultivators of
the soil.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Livy and Strabo tell us
that this goddess was identical with
the Ephesian Artemis&mdash;an acquaintance
with whose cult the Latins
might have obtained through the
Phocean colony at Marseilles. Dr.
Döllinger describes the Ephesian
goddess as "a kind of pantheistic
deity, with more of an Asiatic than
an Hellenic character. She was
most analogous to Cybele as physical
mother and parent of all." S.
Jerome (<cite>Proœm. ad Ephes.</cite>) says
that the Ephesians worshipped Diana,
"not the huntress who carries
the bow and is high-girt, but that
many-breasted one, which the Greeks
call πολυμαστης."</p>

<p>The cultus of Diana in Italy,
though substantially of a benignant
character, seems to have been early
qualified by the sterner rites of
Thrace, where bloody flagellations
had been accepted as a compromise
for human sacrifice. Aricia,
one of the oldest towns in Latium,
boasted that its image of the goddess
had been brought from Tauris.</p>

<p>Originally, Dr. Döllinger reminds
us, neither the Roman Diana nor the
Grecian Artemis were connected in
any way with the moon. As the ancient
Latin sun-god Janus' sister,
Diana was the female divinity of
the sun. Æschylus is generally said
to be the first author who speaks
of Artemis as the moon-goddess;
whereas Hecate was an original
goddess of the moon and of the
night. Hence, when she came to
be identified with Artemis, and
through her with Diana, by an
amalgamation of rites, Diana became
undisputed goddess of the
moon and of the mysterious realms
of the night, the resort of ghosts
and fays. Hecate was a Titan, the
only one who retained power under
the Zeus dynasty; hence her name,
Titanis, or Titania, with which Shakespeare
has familiarized us. Statius
(<cite>Thebaid</cite>, lib. i.) applies this epithet
to the moon:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Titanis late mundo subvecta silenti<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rorifera gelidum tenuaverat aëra biga."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Virgil doubtless gives this title to the
stars as to the moon's supposed satellites
(<em>Æneid</em>, lib. vi.):</p>

<p class="center">"Lucentemque globum lunæ Titaniaque astra."
</p>

<p>In Lucian we have frequent mention
of Hecate and her dogs; in a
fragment of S. Maximus of Turin
the same "aerial dogs" are referred
to, and S. Hippolytus speaks of
Diana and her dogs appearing in
the magician's cauldron.</p>

<p>The amalgamated worship of Hecate
and Diana, the queen of ghosts
and the goddess of fertility, presents
precisely those apparently incongruous
elements which strike us in
fairy mythology, where fairies, and
ghosts, and witches combine so oddly
in the web of mediæval folk-lore.</p>

<p>It was very long before the pagan
element to which the chapter witnesses&mdash;the
Manicheism which holds
that there is something "divine and
godlike beside the one God"&mdash;had
ceased to hold a prominent place
in the fancy of persons professedly
Christian. S. Maximus of Turin,
in the fifth century, thus warns the
Christian farmers of North Italy of
their responsibility in the idolatry of
their servants: "My brother, when
you know that your farm-servant sacrifices,
and you do not prevent his
immolation, you sin. Though you
give him not the wherewithal, yet
leave is granted him. Though he
do not sin by your orders, yet your
will co-operates in the fault. Whilst
you say nothing, you are pleased at
what your servant has done, and
perhaps would have been angry if
he had not done it. Your subordinate
sins, not only on his own score,
when he sacrifices, but on his master's
who forbids him not, who, if he had
forbidden him, would certainly have
been without sin. Grievous indeed
is the mischief of idolatry; it defiles
those who practise it; it defiles the
neighborhood; it defiles the lookers-on;
it pierces through to those who
supply, who know, who keep silent.
When the servant sacrifices, the master
is defiled. He cannot escape
pollution when partaking of bread
which a sacrilegious laborer has reared,
blood-stained fields have produced,
a black barn has garnered. All is
defiled, with the devil in house, field,
and laborers. No part is free from
the crime which steeps the whole.
Enter his hut, you will find withered
sods, dead cinders&mdash;meet sacrifice for
the demon, where a dead deity is entreated
with dead offerings! Go on
into the field, and you will find altars
of wood, images of stone&mdash;a fitting
ministration, where senseless gods are
served on rotting altars! When you
have looked a little further, and found
your servant tipsy and bleeding, you
ought to know that he is, as they call
it, a <em>dianatic</em>, or a soothsayer."</p>

<p>In the VIth century, S. Cæsarius
of Arles, in an almost contemporary
"Life," is said to have cast out "a
devil, which the rustics call a diana."<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>In the XIIth, XIIIth, XIVth,
and XVth centuries, this idolatrous
cultus was not extinct. Montfaucon
quotes part of a decree, in
which Auger of Montfaucon, an ancestor
of his own, Bishop of Conserans,
in the South of France, at
the close of the XIIIth century,
found it necessary to denounce <em>dianaticism</em>:
"Let no woman profess
that she rides by night with Diana,
goddess of the pagans, or with Herodias,
or Bensozia, and raise a route
of women to the rank of deities; for
this is a diabolical illusion."<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>In the Bollandist <cite>Life of S.
James of Bevagna in Umbria</cite>, who
died in 1301, we are told that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>saint distinguished himself "by rebuking
those women who go to the
chase with Diana"; and in 1317,
John XXII., in his bull addressed
to the Bishop of Frejus, denounces
those "who wickedly intermeddle
with divinations and soothsayings,
sometimes using Dianas."</p>

<p>In the XVth century, Cardinal
de Cusa speaks of examining two
women who "had made vows to a
certain Diana who had appeared to
them, and they called her in Italian
Richella, saying she was Fortune."<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>John of Salisbury, Bishop of Chartres
in 1136, talks of this "Sabbath"
company in language which is a
curious medley of classical and mediæval
phraseology. He speaks of the
delusion of those "who assert that
a certain night-bird (<em>nocticulam</em>, or,
according to the generally received
emendation, <i lang="la">nocte lucam</i>, the night-shiner,
a synonyme for Hecate), or
Herodias, or the lady president of the
night, solemnize banquets, exercise
offices of diverse kinds; and now, according
to their deserts, some are
dragged to punishment, others gloriously
exalted."<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>William of Auvergne, Bishop of
Paris in 1224, tells us a good deal
about this queen of the ladies of the
night. They call her, he says, "Satia
(<i lang="la">a satietate</i>), and the Lady Abundia,
from the abundance she is said to
bestow upon the houses which she
frequents." He goes on to say that
these ladies are seen to eat and drink,
yet in the morning the things are as
they were. The pots and jars, however,
must be left open, or they will
go off in a huff. To guard against
such visitations, Alvernus thinks, it
was prescribed in the Levitical law
that vessels should be covered, or accounted
unclean. He speaks of the
"old women amongst whom this delusion
abides"; but it is evidently the
cultus he regards as a delusion, and
the belief that there are spiritual beings
independent both of God and
Satan, not the belief that these are
real diabolical phenomena.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Even
in classic times, it would seem that
Diana and her crew fulfilled in some
measure the office of household fairies:</p>

<p class="center">"Exagitant et lar et turba Diania fures";<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
</p>

<p>and in another passage of the same
poet we find what seems to be an
early indication of the connection
between witches and the feline race.
When worsted by the first onslaught
of the Titans, the gods thus chose
their hiding-places:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Fele soror Phœbi, niveâ Saturnia vacca,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pisce Venus latult, Cyllenius ibidis alvo."<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But to return to the "ladies of the
night." Alvernus says, "They sometimes
enter stables with wax tapers,
the drippings of which appear on the
hairs and necks of the horses, whilst
their manes are carefully plaited."
May we not exclaim with Mercutio,</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"This is that very Mab<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That plaits the manes of horses in the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bakes the elf locks in foul, sluttish hairs"?<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Alvernus' expression is "<i lang="la">guttatos
crines</i>," wax-clotted hairs. Shakespeare's
Mab seems to have played
the same trick upon human beings.</p>

<p>The Lady Abundia is distinctly
identified with Diana's crew, nay,
herself represents that goddess, in a
most curious passage from an early
MS. of the <cite>Roman de la Rose</cite>,
which was a composition of this
same thirteenth century:</p>

<p>Bensozia, or Bezezia, as she is called
in the <cite>Glossarium Novum</cite> from
some MSS. statutes of S. Florus, has
been a great puzzle to antiquarians.
Montfaucon is inclined to identify
her with the <i lang="la">domina noctis</i>, or Abundia.
The <cite>Glossarium Novum</cite> suggests
desperately that it may be a
name for Herodias' daughter. Mr.
Baring-Gould, following Grimm, has
unwittingly furnished, I think, the
true solution. He thus comments
upon a remark of Tacitus in his
<cite>Germania</cite>&mdash;"a part of the Suevi
sacrifice to Isis": "This Isis has
been identified by Grimm with a
goddess Ziza, who was worshipped
by the inhabitants of the parts about
Augsburg. Kuchlen, an Augsburg
poet of the XIVth century, sings:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'They built a great temple therein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the honor of Zize, the heathen goddess.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>This Ziza, Mr. Gould suggests, is
no other than Holda, or Holle, the
wandering moon-goddess of the Teutons,
in other parts called Gôde, under
which name she resembled Artemis
as the heavenly huntress accompanied
by her maidens; in Austria
and Bavaria, Berchta, or Bertha (the
shining); in Suabia and Thuringia,
Hörsel, or Ursel; in other places, the
night-bird, Tutösel. Bezezia would
there be Bena Ziza&mdash;the good Ziza.
Alvernus' "Satia" is, in all probability,
an attempt to Latinize the sound,
as "Abundia" the sense; and so the
three names are reducible to one.</p>

<p>Although the suggestion of the
<cite>Glossarium Novum</cite> is inadmissible,
I cannot but feel that its attempt to
introduce Herodias' daughter into the
"Sabbath" crew is reasonable enough.</p>

<p>I should myself be tempted to think
that Herodias should be understood
as Herodias Junior. Not only is
there a propriety in this, considering
the daughter's antecedents, but it is
clear that fancy was early busy with
her name; witness the weird story
told by the Greek historian, Nicephorus,
of her setting to dancing on the
ice in her mother's sight, and persisting
therein until she gradually broke
through, and finished by dancing her
head off against the sharp edge. On
the other hand, this is, of course, in
the teeth of what must be accepted
as the authentic account given by
Josephus, who calls her Salome, and
allots her two husbands and three
children. Moreover, Cesare Cantù is
able to produce a myth accounting
for the mother's presence, though he
omits all reference to his authority,
which I have vainly attempted to discover.
It is at least <i lang="it">ben trovato</i>: "Credevasi
pure che Erodiade ottenuto il
teschio del Battista volle bacciarlo,
ma quello si ritrasse e soffio, di che
ella fu spinta in aria, e ancora si va
tutte le notte."<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> There is nothing
surprising in meeting with Jewish
features in the rites of mediæval magic,
since Jews were notoriously the
leading magicians, both in Christian
and Moorish states; as, indeed, they
had been before the Christian era,
wherever they had been known
throughout the pagan world. The
term "Sabbath," as applied to the
magic gathering, naturally suggests
itself; but I think it is not really any
direct outcome of Jewish influence.
The word, before its use in <em>diablerie</em>,
had come to be a general expression
for a feast in the Spanish Peninsula,
and had thence no doubt found its
way into France and Germany. The
<cite>Glossarium Novum</cite> gives an extract
from the will of Sancho of Portugal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>(<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1269): "Item ad unum Sabbatum
faciendum mando duas libras."</p>

<p>The idea of Diana, Herodias, and
Bezezia as a magic trinity, or, rather,
as a triform manifestation of one
deity, Latin, Jewish, and barbarian,
was no unnatural outcome of a mixed
race such as peopled Gaul and North
Italy in the first centuries of the
Christian era, and to such an idea
the common image of the triple
Hecate, "Tergeminamque Hecaten
tria Virginis ora Dianæ," easily lent
itself. Dr. Döllinger says: "Hecate
was represented with three bodies
or with three heads, as the goddess
of the star of night, energizing in
three spheres of action&mdash;in heaven,
and earth, and sea&mdash;and at the same
time in allusion to the three phases
of the moon."<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> As Ben Jonson's

<p>The extraordinary way in which
polytheism has sought by an amalgamation
of rites, and so of properties
and personalities, to regain that
unity of worship of which it is the
formal negation, is a great distraction
to antiquarians, who would
fain distinguish precisely the various
cults of paganism. Almost all the
female deities occasionally interchange
offices. Diana is especially
a central figure, in which they all
meet. Venus, Juno, Minerva, ordinarily
representative of such opposite
functions, are, under certain aspects,
identified with Diana. Of Isis
Dr. Döllinger says: "She often stepped
into the place of Demeter, Persephone,
Artemis, and Hecate, and
became dispensatrix of food, mistress
of the lower world and of the sea,
and goddess of navigation. In some
inscriptions she is pantheistically called
'the one who is all.'"<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>"Fables," Sir Francis Palgrave
says, truly enough, "have radiated
from a common centre, and their
universal consent does not prove
their subsequent reaction upon each
other, but their common derivation
from a common origin."<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> None the
less, however, the "subsequent reaction"
is in many cases most real and
important; itself testifying, doubtless,
to a common origin, but at the same
time productive of results of a distinctly
conglomerate character. Often,
too, properties which belonged
to the original parent cultus, and
which have been lost, or have fallen
into abeyance in a derivative, have
been restored to this last by amalgamation
with another cult. For instance,
the Ephesian Artemis, the
parent, as is generally supposed, of
the Latian Diana, was always associated
with the practice of magic.
Her garments were covered with
mystic sentences, which obtained the
name of "Ephesian Letters," and
which were supposed to be potent
charms. The deciphering and application
of these sentences was a regular
art in Ephesus; hence the magic
books which the Ephesians burned
in such numbers under the influence
of S. Paul's preaching. On the other
hand, the Latian Diana seems to
have derived the most part of her
magic properties from her amalgamation
with Hecate.</p>

<p>Evidence is not wanting to show
that the mediæval magical cultus
owes its conglomerate character to
something more than the accidental
mingling of races, or the spontaneous
action of polytheism which I have
noticed.</p>

<p>The Gnostic heretics, and especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>the disciples of Basilides, have
left numerous records of their teaching
and practice in the shape of
engraved gems called <em>abraxi</em>, which
have been discovered in great numbers
throughout North Italy, Gaul,
and Spain. If we look through the
pages devoted to the illustration of
these extraordinary relics in Montfaucon,
we shall find almost all the
peculiar emblems of mediæval magic,
such as cocks and serpents, abracadabra,
the triple Hecate, etc. But
beyond this there is conspicuous the
medley, so characteristic of mediæval
magic, of sacred and profane, Christian
and pagan, divine and diabolical;
the names of God and of our Lord
mixed with those of Latin and Egyptian
deities, Old Testament prophets
and local genii, piety and lewdness,
grace and brutishness&mdash;loathsomely
incongruous, one should fancy, even
to unchristian eyes, as some royal
banquet which harpies have defiled
with blood and ordure.</p>

<p>Basilides himself (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 125) seems
hardly to have been responsible for
these indecencies. He was an eclectic
of the Hebrew-Alexandrian school,
and, if we are to believe Neander,
meant to teach a not unrefined monotheism
by means of a vocabulary of
symbols gathered from all quarters.
But he had prepared a powerful machinery
for evil, of which his unscrupulous
disciples were not slow to
avail themselves. The diabolical guild
spread with extraordinary rapidity,
and struck deep root on all sides.
S. Irenæus writes against it and the
kindred sect of the Valentinians in
the IId century, and S. Jerome in the
Vth century testifies to its influence
in Gaul and Spain.</p>

<p>These Gnostics seem to have gradually
identified themselves with
another and even darker sect of the
same family&mdash;the Ophites, or worshippers
of the serpent; witness the
vast number of serpent gems amongst
the <em>abraxi</em>. With these Ophites, as
with the Cainites, who closely resemble
them, the demiurge, creator,
or world-god, is not merely subordinate,
but imperfect and evil, and
hostile to the everlasting wisdom
symbolized by the serpent. The malignant
creator, jealous of his creature,
throws about him the net of the law,
restraining him from the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil; and from
out of this net, the eternal wisdom, by
the serpent as its intermediary and
symbol, delivers him. And so it is
that, in this perverse system, man's
fall becomes his triumph, and the
devil his redeemer. This principle
was only carried out by the Cainites
when they upheld Cain and Judas
as the representatives of the higher
wisdom and examples of heroic resistance
to the tyranny of the demiurge.
It must be admitted that it
would be quite in keeping with their
usual manner if they are responsible
for the deification of Herodias. Of
the Ophites, Origen reports that they
admitted none to their assemblies
who did not curse Christ.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> This systematic,
detailed perversion of Christianity
is so perfectly in accord with
what we are told of the mediæval
Sabbath, where Christ was renounced
and the Blessed Trinity reviled as a
three-headed Cerberus, that, loath as
are such historians as Neander and
Gieseler to entertain anything so <em>bizarre</em>
as devil-worship, they hardly
know what else to call it. Amongst
many special indications of a connection
between Gnosticism and mediæval
<em>diablerie</em>, I would remark the
following: Alvernus speaks of the
magic book in use in his day, entitled
<cite>Circulus Major</cite>, wherein are instructions
how to form the greater
circle for the evocation of demons;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>also of a "greater" and "lesser"
circle, and of other figures called
"Mandal" and "Aliandet," wherein
convene the four kings of the East,
West, North, and South, with other
demons beside.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Now, Origen speaks
of the "greater and lesser circles" as
rites of the Ophites. It is true that
in Origen's description we do not
hear of four kings, but of seven, who
are styled the "seven princes,"
"lords of the seven gates"<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> "of the
seven heavens"; but the number
does not seem to be marked with any
great precision; for Origen (cap. 31)
reduced them to six, and it is the
worship of the six angels that S.
Boniface is said to have abolished
in Germany in the VIIIth century.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
Again, Alvernus admitted that his
circles contained other demons besides
the four kings.</p>

<p>The four kings are identified as
a Gnostic subdivision of the seven
spirits by Feuerardentius,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> who says
that, according to the Rabbins, Zamael
was one of the four kings of
evil spirits, and reigned in the East,
and also one of the seven planetary
spirits, and presided over Mars. He
was the accuser of the Jews, as Michael
was the defender. The Jews
are said to pray in their synagogues,
"Remember not, O Lord, the accusation
of Zamael, but remember the
defence of Michael." Michael is another
of the seven planetary spirits,
ruling, according to some, in Mercury,
according to others, in the sun,
and wielding the east wind. The
Ophites, with their instinct for desecration,
blended Michael and Zamael
into one, calling them the "<i lang="la">Serpens
projectibilis</i>," with two names.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Of
Adalbert, the heretical worshipper of
the six angels, who was discomfited
by S. Boniface, we are told that "he
pretended to hold intercourse with
S. Michael."</p>

<p>It would seem that something
very much like the ancient rites for
evoking the four kings is still in use
in Africa. Alvernus' account is:
"The master smites the ground in
front of him, toward the eastern
quarter, with outstretched sword, and
saith these words: 'Let the great king
of the East come forth'"; and so on
with the others. In the description
of a modern incantation in Algiers,
related in <cite>Experiences with Home</cite>,
p. 158, we are told, "Loud thrusts and
blows were heard on the ground, and
several forms became visible, apparently
issuing from the earth."</p>

<p>We can hardly avoid the conclusion
that mediæval magic is a Gnostic
tradition, and so additional light is
thrown upon the vehement language
in which the "chapter" denounces
as heretical, and more than heretical&mdash;as
something worse than paganism&mdash;every
feature of a system which apparently
aimed at nothing less than
a pantheistic identification of good
and evil through the deification of
the devil.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to show that
antecedently to, and contemporaneously
with, the legislation of the
"chapter," there existed in the
church a belief in the power of Satan
and in the reality of magic differing
not at all from that which prevailed
in the middle ages. It is easy
to make, as Maffei has done, a <em>catena</em>
of fathers who speak in contempt
of magic, some going so far as to
call it a "nullity." The great fact
that impressed the early Christians
with regard to magic was that everywhere
it was shrinking back before
Christianity; that simple children,
armed with the cross, were more
than a match for the masters of devilish
lore. They were full of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
triumphant disenchantment and purification
of nature so gloriously expressed
in the concluding stanzas of
Milton's "Nativity" ode. But men
do not celebrate a triumph over nothing,
neither can nothing be brought
to naught. The question is, Did the
fathers think it "heretical to attribute
superhuman effects to the aid
of demons"? It will be to the purpose
to collect a few examples of the
way in which they talked of two of
the earliest and most generally accepted
relations of magic&mdash;the account
of Simon Magus' magic powers
and Peter-stinted flight, and the
legend of Cyprian and Jovita. It is
altogether beside the point to insist
that one or both of these relations
are mere legends; the question is,
what the fathers thought it consistent
with the Christian faith to believe.
I shall confine myself to passages
which unmistakably exclude the hypothesis
of mere jugglery.</p>

<p>Of Simon Magus, Justin Martyr
(<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 133, <cite>Apol.</cite>, i. 26) says that "he
did mighty acts of magic by virtue of
the art of the devils acting in him."</p>

<p>S. Hippolytus (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 220, <cite>Refut.</cite>, bk.
vi.) says that he did his sorceries
partly according to the art of Thrasymedes,
in the manner we have described
above, and partly also by the
assistance of demons perpetrating
his villany, "attempted to deify
himself." This testimony as to the
reality of the diabolical intervention is
the more remarkable, as Hippolytus
was a most keen exploder of the
tricks of pagan magicians, amongst
whom was Thrasymedes, and gives,
in the work from which I quote, detailed
accounts of how they produced
their effects by powders and
reflectors, so that people saw Diana
and her hounds, and all manner of
things, in the magic cauldron. Arnobius
(<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 303, <cite>Advers. Gentes</cite>,
lib. ii.) says, "The Romans had seen
the chariot of Simon Magus and his
fiery horses blown abroad by the
mouth of Peter, and utterly to vanish
at the name of Christ."</p>

<p>S. Cyril of Jerusalem (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 350,
<cite>Cat. vi. Illum.</cite>): "After Simon had
promised that he would rise up aloft
into the heavens, and was borne
up in a demon chariot and carried
through the air, the servants of God,
throwing themselves on their knees,
and manifesting that agreement of
which Jesus spake&mdash;'If two of you
be of accord concerning whatsoever
thing you shall ask, it shall be granted'&mdash;by
the javelin of their concord
let fly at the magician brought him
headlong to the ground."</p>

<p>S. Maximus of Turin (<cite>Serm. in
Fest. S. Petri</cite>): "When that Simon
said he was Christ, and declared that
as a son he would fly up on high to
his father, and straightway, lifted up
by his magic arts, began to fly, then
Peter on his knees besought the
Lord, and by his holy prayers overcame
the magic levity." The story
of Cyprian and Jovita records the
repeated but fruitless attempts of the
heathen magician, Cyprian, to overcome
the chastity of the Christian
virgin, Jovita, by means of a lascivious
demon, whom he employs as his
agent, and how Cyprian is finally
converted.</p>

<p>S. Gregory Nazianzen (<cite>Orat.</cite> 24)
does not hesitate to speak thus:
"He (Cyprian) tried all the more,
and employed as his procurer no
ancient hag of the sort fit for such
things, but one of the body-loving,
pleasure-loving demons; since the
envious and apostate spirits are keen
for such service, seeking many partners
in their fall. And the wage of
such procuration was offerings and
libations, and the appropriation of
the fumes of blood; for such reward
must be bestowed upon those that
are thus gracious."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>As to S. Augustine, even Janus
admits that this father does furnish
an awkward passage (<cite>De Civ. Dei</cite>,
xv. 23) about the commerce of
demons with women, which "the
Dominican theologians seized on";
"but the saint used it in mere blind
credulity," and, though he never
exactly retracted it, did retract "a
similar statement (<cite>Retract.</cite>, ii. 30)."<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
Unfortunately for Janus, no two
statements could be more dissimilar.
The statement which S. Augustine
retracts is one limiting the devil's
power; the statement which he does
not retract is one in which it is
precisely Janus' complaint that he
exaggerates it. In matter of fact, S.
Augustine is the great storehouse
from which the scholastics have
obtained almost all they have to say
on <em>diablerie</em>.</p>

<p>S. Augustine, in his treatise, <cite>De
Trinitate</cite> (lib. iii. cap. 8), having
distinguished the creator of the "invisible
seeds," the first elements of
things, latent everywhere throughout
the frame of nature, as the <em>Creator</em>,
whereas all other authors are
but <em>producers</em>, thus speaks (cap. 9):
"What they (the evil spirits) can do
by virtue of their nature, but cannot
do through the prohibition of God,
and what they are not suffered to
do by the condition of their nature, is
past man's finding out, except through
the gift of God, which the apostle
commemorates, saying, 'To another
the discernment of spirits.' We
know that man can walk, though
walk he cannot unless he be permitted;
so those angels can do certain
things if allowed by more powerful
angels at God's command, and cannot
do certain other things, even if
these allow them, because he suffers
it not from whom their nature hath
its native bounds, who, through his
angels, very often prevents them doing
such things as he allows them to
be able to do."</p>

<p><cite>De Civ. Dei</cite>, lib. xxi. cap. 6: "Demons
are allured to dwell with men
by means of creatures which not they,
but God, has gifted with sweetness
diverse after their kind; not as brutes
are attracted by food, but as spirits
by signs which are congruous to each
one's pleasure&mdash;by various kinds of
stones, herbs, trees, animals, charms,
and rites. But in order that they
should be so allured by men, they
first seduce them with astutest cunning,
either by breathing into their
hearts a secret poison, or even by
appearing in the deceitful guise of
friendship, and make a few their
scholars and the teachers of many.
Neither would it be possible to learn,
unless they first taught it, by what
name they are invited, by what compelled;
whence magic arts and their
adepts have taken rise.... And
their works are exceedingly numerous,
which, the more marvellous we
acknowledge them to be, the more
cautiously we must avoid."</p>

<p>S. Isidore (<cite>Etym.</cite>, lib. viii. cap. 9)
says of magicians: "These trouble
the elements, disturb men's minds,
and, without any poison-draught, by
the mere force of their charm, destroy
life."</p>

<p>Venerable Bede, in the VIIth
century (in <cite>Luc.</cite>, lib. iii. cap. 8), says
of the commerce of <em>incubi</em> and <em>succubi</em>,
which Janus tells us was an invention
of the Dominicans, that "it
is a matter as really true as it looks
like a lie, and is notoriously attested
by numbers." He tells us that a
priest of a neighboring parish related
to him that he had to exorcise a
woman so beset, and to heal the
ulcers which the devil had left upon
her. These were all cured by blest
salt, except the largest, which was
not healed until the priest was told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
what to do by his patient. "If,"
said she, "you mix the oil consecrated
for the sick with the same medicine
(<em>i.e.</em> the salt), and so anoint
me, I shall be at once restored to
health; for I whilom saw in the spirit,
in a certain far-off city, a girl affected
with the same calamity cured in this
way by the priest." He did as she
suggested, and at once the ulcer consented
to receive the remedy, which
it had before rejected. Hincmar (<cite>De
Divort. Loth. et Tetb.</cite>, p. 654) says
that certain women "a Dusiis in
specie virorum quorum amore ardebant
concubitum pertulisse inventa
sunt"; and the context shows that
he is not merely quoting S. Augustine,
but bearing his own testimony;
for he speaks of their exorcism. He
proceeds to give an account of various
kinds of witchery, with an unmistakable
conviction of their reality,
and clinches them with the wonderful
story from the <cite>Life of S. Basil</cite>, by
the pseudo-Amphilochius, in his time
newly translated out of the Greek.
It is the same story which Southey
has turned to such good account in
his <cite>All for Love</cite>; and certainly few
mediæval legends surpass it in the
realism of its <em>diablerie</em>. A young
man obtains for his wife a girl, who
is on the eve of taking the veil, by
means of a charm got at the price
of a compact written in his blood,
surrendering his soul to the evil one.
When the young man repents, and
the devil insists on his bargain, S.
Basil discomfits the fiend before the
whole congregation, and wrings from
him the fatal writing. Now, Hincmar
was the leading prelate in the Gallic
Church in the IXth century&mdash;that is
to say, in the very church and the
very century in which was almost
certainly composed the "chapter"
in which Janus supposes that all
belief in witchcraft was condemned
as heresy.</p>

<p>Ivo of Chartres, in the XIth
century, one of the very authors
whom, because they transcribe the
"chapter," Janus appeals to as representatives
of what he regards as
the ancient tradition, speaks thus on
the interpretation of Genesis vi. 2:
"It is more likely that just men,
under the appellation of angels or
sons of God, sinned with women,
than that angels, who are without
flesh, could have condescended to
that sin; although of certain demons
who maltreat women many
persons relate so many things that a
determination one way or the other
is not easy."<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>When we come to the great scholastics
of the XIIIth century, we
find that where they have varied in
aught from the teaching of their predecessors
on the subject of magic, it
was, on the whole, in the direction
of moderation, or what would be
called nowadays rationalism. For
instance, in considering the question
of diabolical intercourse with women,
a belief in which, as we have seen,
they had inherited from a line of
theologians, they gave an explanation
which, whatever may be said of
it, at least repudiated the idea of
an actual mixture of carnal and
spiritual natures. Again, they were
very careful to guard against the
notion that there is anything that
can be called with propriety an art-magic&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>
that there is any other
than an arbitrary connection between
the charms used and the results obtained&mdash;which
is more than can be
said of some of their predecessors.</p>

<p>Janus (p. 258), with the operose
mendacity which is his characteristic,
pretends that the authority "of the
popes, Aquinas, and the powerful
Dominican Order" established the
reality of the Sabbath rides; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
in the XIVth and XVth centuries
you might "be condemned as a
heretic in Spain for affirming, and in
Italy for denying, the reality of the
Sabbath rides"; that some Franciscan
theologians in the XVth century,
amongst others Alfonso de
Spina, in his <cite>Fortalitium Fidei</cite>,
maintained the ancient doctrine asserting
"belief in the reality of witchcraft
to be a folly and a heresy";
that Spina "thought that the inquisitors
had witches burned simply on
account of that belief." "Tot verba
tot mendacia"! The question of the
reality or non-reality of the Sabbath
rides has always been an open question.
S. Thomas says nothing about
them one way or the other. It is
much more probable than not that
he regarded those rides as fantastic,
in accordance with the teaching
of his masters, Albertus Magnus<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
and Alexander Hales.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> That he
never committed himself to the opposite
view is pretty well assured by
the fact that the great representative
of "the powerful Dominican Order"
in the XVth century, Cardinal Turrecremata,
is an advocate of the
view which makes the rides fantastic.
We may add that his
eminence got on very comfortably
during his long residence in
Italy, without being molested for his
Spanish heresy.</p>

<p>As to Alfonso Spina, he, indeed,
asserts the fantastic character of
the Sabbath flights; but so little is he
a disbeliever in <em>diablerie</em> that, not
contented with maintaining its reality
(<cite>Fortal.</cite>, f. 146, p. 1, col. 1),<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> he
contributes a rather grotesque instance
of it from his own experience
(f. 151, p. 1, col. 2).</p>

<p>He nowhere says that inquisitors
had witches burned "simply on account"
of their belief in the reality of
the Sabbath. He recounts the burning
of certain witches in Dauphiny
and Gascony, who did hold their
Sabbath meetings to be real, which
view, as attributing a certain divine
power to the devil, Spina thought
could not be persisted in without
heresy. (See fol. 152, p. 2, col. 1.)
But they were burned because they
were witches who had done real homage
to the devil, although sundry
of its circumstances might be imaginary.</p>

<p>The following passages may be
accepted as examples of the doctrine
on spiritualism of the principal scholastics
of the XIIIth century.</p>

<p>S. Thomas, <cite>Sum.</cite> i. qu. 110, lays
down that God only can work a
miracle properly so called&mdash;<em>i.e.</em> a
work beyond the order of the whole
of created nature; "but since not
every virtue of created nature is
known to us, therefore, when anything
takes place by a created virtue
unknown to us, it is a miracle in respect
to us; and so, when the devils
do something by their natural power,
it is called a miracle, <i lang="la">quoad nos</i>;
and in this way magicians work miracles
by means of devils." (In 4 <cite>Dist.</cite>
vii. qu. 3.) "The devils, by their
own power, cannot induce upon
matter any form, whether accidental
or substantial, nor reduce it to act,
without the instrumentality of its
proper natural agent.... The
devils can bring to bear activities
upon particular passivities, so that
the effect shall follow from natural
causes indeed, but beside the accustomed
course of nature, on account
of the variety and vehemence of the
active virtue of the active forces
combined, and the aptitude of the
subjects;<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> and so effects which are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>outside the sphere of all natural
active virtues they cannot really produce&mdash;as
raise the dead or the like&mdash;but
only in appearance."</p>

<p><cite>De Malo</cite>, qu. xvi. art. 9: "The
devils can do what they do, 1st,
Because they know better than men
the virtue of natural agents. 2d.
Because they can combine them with
greater rapidity. 3d. Because the
natural agents which they use as
instruments can attain to greater
effects by the power and craft of the
devils than by the power and craft
of men."</p>

<p>Alexander Hales, <cite>Sum.</cite>, pars 2,
qu. 42, art. 3, says that nothing, however
wonderful, "is a miracle which
takes place in accordance with the
natural or seminal order, but every
miracle holds of the causal ratio
(creative cause) only," (L.C. qu. 43).
He admits that these marvels of the
seminal order are miracles <i lang="la">secundum
modum faciendi</i>&mdash;a term equivalent
to S. Thomas' <i lang="la">quoad nos</i>.</p>

<p>Albertus Magnus, <cite>Op.</cite>, tom. xviii.
tract viii. qu. 3, art. 1, points
out that the miracles of Pharao's
magicians are called lies, "not because
they are unreal (<i lang="la">falsa in se</i>),
but because the devils have always
the intention of deceiving in those
works which they are allowed to do."</p>

<p>To sum up, the doctrine of the
scholastics on the subject of the
devil's power comes to this: The
devil is a great artist, who can present
incomparable shows to the senses
and the imagination, and a supreme
chemist, who can combine natural
agents indefinitely, and can elicit in
a twinkling the virtual contents of
each combination; but he can create,
and, strictly speaking, originate,
nothing external to himself. They
knew that, in mercy to mankind,
Almighty God was ever restraining
the devil in the exercise of this power;
but they conceived that the power
itself continued unaltered. It was
generally admitted that the devil
could not raise a dead man to life,
or restore a sense, as the sight, when
really destroyed. But such acts were
regarded by the scholastics as precisely
instances of the creation or origination
of such a mode as could not be
the outcome of any mere combination
of natural agents, and which,
therefore, must require the fiat of the
Creator. At the same time, it must
be admitted that they often found it
difficult to distinguish in fact between
the operation of the limits of the
devil's finite nature and the result
of the habitual reservation of Almighty
God.</p>

<p>And here it may not unnaturally
be objected that the large allowance
I have made to natural powers, and to
the devil's power of manipulating
them, tends to lessen the effect of the
argument from miracles. No doubt
it tends to reduce a considerable
number of miracles from the category
of logical proof to that of rhetorical
argument. Where the miracle is
supposed wholly above nature, it is
a proof that God is with those who
work it; but where it is not beyond
the sphere of universal nature, it can,
for the most part, only offer a greater
or less persuasion dependent upon circumstances.
However, such natural
miracles, so to call them, approximate
more or less closely to logical
cogency in proportion as they manifest
themselves as the victors in a
war of miracles; for it cannot be
supposed that in such a war God
should allow himself to be worsted,
or that Satan should be divided
against himself. When God first
presented himself as a wonder-worker
before human witnesses, it was as
developing and modifying in a supernatural
manner the powers of nature&mdash;nay,
of local, Egyptian nature&mdash;and
outdoing and discomfiting the magi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>cians
"who did in like manner." A
recent Catholic commentator, Dr.
Smith, in his very learned work,
<cite>The Book of Moses</cite>, points out in detail
"the analogy which most of the
plagues present with the annual phenomena
of the country."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Of the
prelude to the plagues, the conversion
of the rod of Moses into a serpent,
he says: "Even at the present
day, the descendants, or at least representatives,
of the Psylli ... can
change the asp into a rod stiff and
rigid, and at pleasure restore it to
flexibility and life by seizing the tail
and rolling it between their hands."</p>

<p>In his treatment of the first plague,
he gives the following account of the
annual phenomenon: "For some
time before the rise, the Nile assumes
a green color; it then becomes putrid
and unfit to drink. Gradually, about
the 25th June, a change comes on;
the green color and putrid odor
disappear; the water becomes clear
again, then takes a yellow tinge,
which passes into an ochreous red;
until for ninety days before the inundation
gains its greatest height, it is
popularly called the <em>red water</em>. 'On
the first appearance of the change,'
says an eye-witness, 'the broad, turbid
tide certainly has a striking resemblance
to a river of blood.'<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> ...
At the moment foretold by
Moses, the miraculous rod is lifted
up and waved over the stream; instantaneously
the red attains all its
intensity of color; the fish, which in
ordinary years live on through the
gradual habituation to a different
state, now perish in numbers from
the very suddenness of the change;
and the putrid odor, which usually
exhales from it before the rise, comes
back again in consequence of this
mortality. The blood-red hue is not
confined to the spot where Pharao
and his magicians stood. It spreads
at once into the various channels
into which the river divides itself,
into the canals which are carried
through the land for irrigation, into
the lakes and ponds which served as
reservoirs, into all the collections of
Nile-water, and the very vessels of
stone and wood which were commonly
used both in town and country
for private cisterns. The consequence
is that at the very time the
water begins to sweeten, it becomes
again undrinkable; the Egyptians
loathe the water, a draught of which
is esteemed one of the greatest luxuries
they can enjoy; and, as the inhabitants
still do when anything
prevents them from drinking of the
river, 'they digged round about the
river for water, for they could not
drink of the water of the river.'"</p>

<p>Of the plague of frogs, the same author
remarks: "Such a nuisance was
not unknown in some other countries,
and there are instances of the inhabitants
being in consequence driven
from their settlements, as Athenæus
remarks of the Pœonians and Dardanians,
Diodorus of the Antariats of
Illyria, and Pliny of some Gaulish
nation. But in Egypt they are not
unfrequently equivalent to a plague.
Indeed, Hasselquist believes that
every year that would be the result,
were it not for the species of stork,
called <i lang="la">ardea ibis</i>, which in the month
of September comes down in large
flocks to feed upon the small frogs
then beginning to swarm over the
country."</p>

<p>As regards the third plague, that
of the <em>ciniphs</em>, or Egyptian mosquito,
Dr. Smith thinks that the magicians
could not produce them, because at
that time of the year they were not
yet out of the egg. This, as we have
seen, is not the doctrine of the scholastics,
and is hardly consistent with the
idea that the magicians were any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>thing
more than conjurers. I would
suggest that the mosquitoes had to
do something more than show themselves
and crawl in order to vindicate
their reality as plagues. Doubtless
the magicians and their familiars
hatched the eggs; and there the effete
creatures were, with knock-knees, and
flaccid trunks, and languid appetites;
but they were as though they were
not when the orthodox mosquitoes
sounded their horns for the banquet,
and put in their stings with all and
more than all their native vigor.
Well might the magicians exclaim in
anguish, "This is the finger of God."<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
Abbot Rupert, a writer of the XIIth
century, gives precisely the same <em>rationale</em>
of the magicians' failure, whilst
maintaining that their successes were
of the nature of phantasmagoria.</p>

<p>Of the remaining plagues, the
fourth, that of flies, was too like
the third for the magicians to
hope for success; and when at the
sixth plague they seem again to
take heart, behold, they cannot
"stand before Moses for the boils
that are upon them." The dreadful
sequel, closing in darkness and death,
would seem to have simply swept
them away in its tide of horror.</p>

<p>So far, then, from there being any
reason for shrinking from the idea of
a miraculous competition, in which
the spirit of man, the demon, and
Almighty God enter the lists together,
we ought rather to rejoice at
the recurrence of the very conditions
which God is wont to choose for the
scene of his most triumphant manifestations.</p>

<p>I have thus drawn out the Catholic
idea of <em>diablerie</em>, because I believe
that one of the causes most active in
spiritualism&mdash;a cause necessary to the
evolution of a great number of its
phenomena&mdash;is the devil. In matter
of fact, to this cause these phenomena
have been for ages universally attributed.
It may, then, fairly claim to
be the hypothesis in possession. In
the concluding chapter, I hope to
consider the amendment which spiritualists,
as a rule, suggest&mdash;viz., that
the spirits whom they admit with us
to be the causes of the phenomena
are not devils, enemies of God and
man, but the souls of the departed
in varying stages of perfection.</p>

<h3>THE FARM OF MUICERON.</h3>


<p class="center">BY MARIE RHEIL.</p>

<p class="center">FROM THE REVUE DU MONDE CATHOLIQUE.
</p>


<h4>V.</h4>

<p>Those who are fond of singular
events in this world had here a chance
to be satisfied; for, certainly, this
affair surpassed anything in the ordinary
run. Pierrette quickly recovered,
and nursed her little one without
fatigue. Far from becoming
even the least pale or thin, it was
remarked, even by the envious&mdash;and
there are always some of the tribe
around the happy&mdash;that she was
rejuvenated, fresh as a cherry, and
the baby in her arms made her resemble
the good S. Anne, mother of our
Blessed Lady, whose chapel was
near our parish church.</p>

<p>Besides, the great esteem felt for
the Ragauds, their charity, honesty,
and well-known piety, caused it to be
acknowledged&mdash;and it was true&mdash;that
this new blessing, the choicest and
most unexpected they could have
desired, was the recompense of the
Lord God on account of little Jean-Louis.
M. le Curé said it to whoever
would listen to him; and, as we
have seen he was fond of repeating
proverbs, he did not fail to add: "If
there is one truth that each and
every one of us can prove if he wishes,
it is '<em>that a good action is never lost</em>.'
Now, if this is always true in regard
to men, judge if we should believe it
when the good God, all-powerful, is
our creditor!"</p>

<p>M. le Marquis de Val-Saint was
the first and most sincere in rejoicing
at the happiness of his good farmers.
Mademoiselle, his daughter, asked to
be godmother, and had made under
her own eyes, by her maids, a complete
outfit of fine Holland linen, of which
all the little garments were scalloped,
embroidered, and trimmed with lace;
such as are only displayed in the
shop-windows of the city.</p>

<p>M. le Marquis naturally stood godfather
with mademoiselle, and, not to
be behind her in presents, ordered that,
on the day of the baptism, there should
be feasting and village-dances on the
lawn before the château.</p>

<p>It was a day to be remembered in
the neighborhood. As for the eating,
singing, and laughter, you can well
think nothing was wanting; they
spoke of it for months afterwards.
Only one person wore a rather long
face, and that was our <i lang="fr">curé</i>; not that
he was ever the enemy of pleasure
and enjoyment, but that, contrary to
his advice, M. le Marquis had three
casks of old wine, reserved for his
own table, tapped; and the consequence
was that, out of two hundred
persons present, men, women, and
children, not one, towards twilight,
was able to walk straight on his legs.</p>

<p>Apart from that, everything passed
off splendidly; and, to conclude, I will
tell you that they had awaited the
complete recovery of Mother Pierrette,
so that she might be present
at the celebration with her little girl
in her arms; which, to my mind, was
the prettiest part of the show.</p>

<p>The little Ragaudine had three
beautiful names&mdash;Nicole-Eveline, after
M. le Marquis and mademoiselle,
her god-parents; and Jeanne, in honor
of our great S. John the Baptist,
on whose feast she had the good fortune
to be born. One fact, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
would have touched devout hearts
if they had known it, was that little
Jean-Louis had also come into the
world on S. John's day, four years
before. M. le Curé, who had it from
poor Catharine, but who could not
breathe a word of it, was nevertheless
so inspired by the thought that he
made at the baptism a speech which
drew all the handkerchiefs out of the
pockets; and if I have one regret, it
is that I cannot give a full report of
his touching words. But I was not
born at that time, and my father,
from his great age, had forgotten
them when he related this story to
me.</p>

<p>If you fancy that this event affected
in the least degree the condition
of Jean-Louis, you are vastly mistaken.
True, there was no longer
thought of his inheriting Muiceron;
but the tenderness and care of his good
parents were the same afterwards as
before. Pierrette would have thought
it a sin to have acted otherwise; for
she was always the first to say: "It
was the boy's guardian angel that
obtained for me my little girl from
the good God." Ragaud thought the
same as his wife, but was a little more
anxious than she about the temporal
prospects of the boy. It was evident
that, between the fear of injuring
his daughter, and the dread of leaving
Jeannet in want, his good heart
did not know which side to turn.
Finally, in his embarrassment, he determined
to consult M. le Curé; and
the good pastor, who had always an
answer ready, solved the difficulty in
fifteen minutes' conversation. According
to his advice, it would suffice
to place aside every year a small sum,
drawn from the harvest of such and
such a field, and never to touch either
capital or interest. In that way,
before twenty years, Master Jean-Louis
would find himself, without
any injury to the little girl, master of
a nice little treasure, and capable, in
his turn, of being a land-owner. This
affair settled, Ragaud returned home
perfectly satisfied, and told the whole
story to Pierrette, who highly approved
of the step.</p>

<p>Thus, instead of one child at Muiceron,
there were two, and that was
all the difference. The little things
grew up calling themselves brother
and sister, there being nothing to
make them doubt but that it was
really so. Never were quarrelling
or bad words heard between them.
Ragaud often repeated to Jeannet
that, as he was the eldest, he should
live patiently and amicably with his
young sister; and Jeannet, from his
gentle heart and natural sweetness
of disposition, easily put the counsel
in practice.</p>

<p>It is commonly said that girls are
more forward than boys, as much in
body as in mind; and another proof
of the truth of this remark was evident
as the Ragaud children grew
up. At six years old, the little girl
was so bright, so cunning, so bold, and
had such a strong constitution, you
would have thought her the twin-sister
of Jean-Louis; but with all
that, there was no resemblance, either
in face or disposition, even though
they say that, by living together, people
often grow to look alike. Jeanne
Ragaud had very light hair, was
joyous and petulant, a little quick-tempered
and rough in her actions,
like her father; Jean had a thoughtful
look, and although he was always
ready to play, his tastes were rather
quiet. They both loved to lead
the sheep to pasture in the field
near La Range; but when it was
the turn of the little boy, you would
have said the sheep took care of
themselves, so quiet was it around
them; and the reason of this was,
that the shepherd was stretched in
the wood, in the shade of an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
willow-tree, face to the sky, watching
the clouds pass over his head.
Very different was it when Jeannette,
armed with a switch, left the farm,
driving the flock before her in the
noisiest style; she drove off the dog,
ran faster than he after the sheep
which tried to get away from her;
and if she ever sat down, it was only
because she was forced to do so
from want of breath. As for the
clouds, little did she care for all that
Jean pretended to see in them&mdash;the
beautiful and moving things that
kept him lying on the grass for entire
hours, silently gazing with fixed eyes
on the blue sky above him. She
obstinately declared that a cloudy
sky pleased her more than one entirely
blue, because generally clouds
brought rain; and nothing, according
to her taste, was more delightful than
a good soaking, which obliged the
shepherdess and sheep to return
together at full gallop to the house,
running and paddling through the
pools of muddy water.</p>

<p>This divergence of character grew
more and more perceptible every
day, and led Pierrette to exclaim:</p>

<p>"Come next S. Martin's day, and
if this continues, my little chickens,
I will have you change clothes;
for, in truth, I begin to see that I
was mistaken, and that Jeannette
is the boy, and <em>Louisieau</em> the little
girl."</p>

<p>These words did not fall on the
ear of a deaf person; for, after that,
<em>La Ragaudine</em> became bolder and
more resolute than ever. She domineered
over father and mother, who
were weak enough to be amused by
it; and as for Jean-Louis, when he
ventured to offer a little friendly advice,
she replied proudly, with her
chin in the air:</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue; mother said I
was the boy."</p>

<p>Thereupon good Jeannet was terribly
confused, and could not find
words to reply.</p>

<p>Soon the time came when they
must think of school. In those days,
there were no parish schools taught
by the Sisters and Christian Brothers,
as now. Our good <i lang="fr">curé</i>, through
pure zeal, had taken charge of the
boys' education, and Germaine did
the same for the girls. Thus the
Ragaud children did not have to
accustom themselves to new faces
in this little change of their everyday
life. But old Germaine could not
say as much; for until then, having
only taught the village girls, who
were very obedient, even though a
little stupid, she thought the devil
himself possessed the school the
day that Jeannette put foot in it.
What tricks and drolleries this little
witch of eight years invented to distract
the others would be difficult
to enumerate. Threats, scolding,
shameful punishments, had no effect.
At the end of a fortnight, she had
received all the bad marks of the
class, and the fool's cap appeared to
be her ordinary head-dress, so that
the greatest wonder was if she by
chance was seen without it.</p>

<p>Jean-Louis, in the adjoining room,
accomplished wonders. In less than
four months, he learned to read and
write; as for his catechism, he knew
it so well he could explain it like a
priest. Never did he go to sleep
without knowing his lessons for the
next day; so that M. le Curé held
him in high favor, and taught him
many things that are found in books,
but which are not generally known
in the country.</p>

<p>Thus it turned out that all the
praises and dainties fell to the lot of
Jeannet as a reward for his good conduct.
Every Thursday he returned
to the farm, holding up with both
hands the front of his blouse, filled
with fruit and candies of Germaine's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
manufacture. Jeannette kept close
to his side, not at all displeased at
having nothing&mdash;you can well imagine
why. The cunning monkey knew
that hardly would they have turned
on their heels, before Jean-Louis
would open his blouse, and say,
"Here, little pet, choose."</p>

<p>So that, without giving herself the
least trouble, that imp of a Jeannette
feasted at will on the choicest morsels.
Our <i lang="fr">curé</i> was not long duped;
without scolding Jean-Louis, who by
acting in that manner only proved
his good heart, he warned Germaine
that she must try some other
means of correcting the headstrong
Jeannette, who could not be allowed
to grow up with such perverse habits.
Germaine, very much hurt, replied
that she had used every punishment
unsuccessfully, except whipping, which
she had never dared.</p>

<p>"Well," said the <i lang="fr">curé</i>, "the next
time she misbehaves, whip her, Germaine.
I authorize you to do it."</p>

<p>They had not to wait long. One
very rainy day, Jeannette managed
to arrive the last at school, and seeing
all the children's wooden shoes and
leather leggings ranged outside of the
door, she gathered up the greater
part of them in her skirt, and ran off
to the well, that she might throw
them to the bottom, running the risk
of tumbling in herself at the same
time. Germaine, who was still light-footed,
and feared something wrong
was contemplated, spied her through
the window, rushed after her, and
caught her just in time to prevent
the act.</p>

<p>"This is the way," cried she, holding
the young one tightly by the arm&mdash;"this
is the way you, wicked good-for-nothing
child, employ your time, instead
of learning your lessons!"</p>

<p>For the first time, Jeannette, in
spite of her daring spirit, was so overcome
she could not say a word in
defence. She saw quickly that she
would be well punished, and returned
to the class very downcast.</p>

<p>Germaine commenced by making
her pupil kneel in the middle of the
room, and then, seating herself in her
straw arm-chair, with a severe and
troubled look, related the whole affair,
taking care to make it appear in
its worst light.</p>

<p>"Now," added she, looking around
at her little audience, who showed a
just indignation, "if I ask you, my
children, what punishment Jeanne
Ragaud deserves for having attempted
to enjoy herself in such a malicious
and shameful manner, you will
doubtless answer that I should expel
her from the class; but do you
think that would be a great sorrow
for a girl so careless of her duties?
No, no, I say that would only please
her; and therefore, Jeanne Ragaud,
you will immediately receive a severe
chastisement, but which, nevertheless,
is not equal to your great fault."</p>

<p>Thereupon Germaine readjusted
her spectacles, drew from the bottom
of her big work-bag a leather whip
with several thongs, and Jeannette,
more dead than alive with anger and
shame, received in full view the well-deserved
punishment.</p>

<p>She neither cried, nor wept, nor
made any protestation, not even an
attempt to defend herself; but she
did not ask pardon either, and sat
straight up on her bench, whiter than
Mother Germaine's cap. It was the
only day they had ever seen her
quiet and good.</p>

<p>Towards evening, Jeannet, as usual,
took his post where he could meet
her, that they might return home together;
but great was his surprise
to see the little thing advance with
measured steps, instead of running
and bounding according to her custom.
What astonished him still further
was that she neither spoke nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
laughed. Her little face was all
changed; but whether from grief or
anger he could not discover. It ended
by making him feel very anxious,
as he feared she was ill.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" he asked gently.
"Surely, Jeannette, something
troubles you; for this is the first time
in my life I have ever seen you
sad."</p>

<p>The child turned away her head,
and pretended to look at the trees.</p>

<p>"You will not answer me," continued
Jean-Louis; "and yet I only
question you from pure love, not
from curiosity. When one is troubled,
it is a relief to speak to a friend.
Am I not strong enough to defend
you by tongue and arm, in case you
<em>need</em> it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing is the matter," replied
Jeannette. "What do you fancy
ails me? Let us hurry, it is growing
late; the crows are beginning to
flutter around the steeple."</p>

<p>"I am not thinking now about
the crows, nor you either, Jeannette,"
said he, taking in his own her
little, trembling hand; "and as for
going faster, that is not possible; we
are already walking at such a rate
we can scarcely breathe."</p>

<p>Jeanne stopped short, and quickly
drew away her hand.</p>

<p>"Then, don't go any further," cried
she in a rebellious tone.</p>

<p>"Come, now, be good; we can't
think of stopping here. Why do you
speak to me so roughly? Don't
you know that I am your friend and
your brother?"</p>

<p>"When you will know what has
happened," replied she impatiently,
"well&mdash;then&mdash;then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then I will console you as
well as I can, my Jeannette."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, but you can't do it,
Jean-Louis; in my trouble nobody
can console me."</p>

<p>"Let us see," said he.</p>

<p>"There is nothing to see," she
cried. "I won't tell you anything."</p>

<p>"Then it will be difficult," he replied
sadly. "Jeannette, if I were
unhappy, I would not make such a
fuss about telling you."</p>

<p>They continued on in silence.
When they reached the top of the
hill in the meadow of Fauché, from
which could be seen the buildings
of Muiceron, Jeannette suddenly
stopped, and all the anger heaped
up in her little heart melted into
sobs.</p>

<p>"What will mother say when she
sees you return with red eyes?" said
good Jeannet, terribly distressed. "I
beg of you, my darling, speak to me;
you would never cry like this for
nothing."</p>

<p>"O Jean-Louis! I am so unhappy,"
she cried, throwing herself
in his arms; "and if they make me
go back to school, I will certainly
die."</p>

<p>"Now, stop; don't cry any more.
You shall not go back," said he, kissing
her; "for none of us wish to see
you die."</p>

<p>Jeannette this time did not need
urging, but frankly related all her
wrongs and the affair of the whip.
Jean-Louis for the moment was so
furious he would willingly have
beaten Germaine; but after a little
reflection, he thought that after all
the correction was not altogether
unjust.</p>

<p>He spoke wisely to the little thing,
and succeeded in calming her in a
measure; but he could not make her
change her mind about returning
to school. On this point it was as
difficult to make an impression as
on a stone wall.</p>

<p>"What will we do?" said he. "For
you see, Jeannette, father has already
received so many complaints
about you he will most assuredly
not consent to let you remain idle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
at the farm. To-morrow we will
leave without saying a word. Do
what I tell you; say your prayers
well to-night; and as, after all, you
were a good deal in fault, the best
thing will be to ask Germaine's pardon,
which she will willingly grant."</p>

<p>"I would rather run off into the
woods," cried the rebellious child.
"I would rather be eaten up by
the wolves."</p>

<p>"No, no, that is foolish," said he,
"they would hunt for you, and the
woods around Val-Saint are not
so big but what they could find
you; and then everybody would
know your fault, and father would
be so angry."</p>

<p>"Very well," said she resolutely.
"I will go see my godmother."</p>

<p>"That can easily be done," replied
Jeannet; "and it is a very good
idea. Dry up your tears now; to-morrow
morning we will go together
and see mademoiselle; she will
know what to do."</p>

<p>This agreement made, Jeanne's
great sorrow was quickly dissipated.
She recovered her good humor, her
lively manner, and was as full of fun
and frolic as ever. The grief of children
is like the clouds in the sky&mdash;a
mere nothing causes them, a nothing
scatters them; and the sun appears
more beautiful than ever after a
shower. Jean and Jeannette reached
the house, running together hand
in hand. Neither Ragaud nor Pierrette
suspected anything; and nevertheless,
that night, without any
one even dreaming of it, the whim
of a little eight-year-old witch led to
many new events which changed
the life of our good friends, as you
will see in the end.</p>


<h4>VI.</h4>

<p>It is time that I should tell you
about the château of our village, and
of its worthy lord, M. le Marquis de
Val-Saint. The château was an imposing
edifice, so high and wide, with
such thick walls, and so well surrounded
with deep ditches filled with
running water, that my father truly
said such a building had nothing to
fear from either time or man. Before
the great Revolution, our lords lived
in great style. I have heard it said
that one of them, who was a great
warrior, could lead into the field more
than a thousand soldiers, all of them
his tenants, armed and equipped at
his own expense. What makes me
believe this was not false is the fact
that there still remains in front of the
château a great lawn, flanked on each
side by buildings of such length
they must surely have been used for
barracks. But as to that, he that
chooses may believe; I cannot positively
affirm it, and, besides, it has
very little bearing on the story of
Jean-Louis.</p>

<p>As was to have been expected, our
lords were driven away at the time
when the masters had to fly, that
their valets could take their places.
Thank God! this fine condition of
things did not last long. At the end
of a few years, the legitimate owner
of the château of Val-Saint, who was
a little child at the time the family
left France, was put in possession of
his property. He afterwards married,
and had an only daughter, the
godmother of Jeannette.</p>

<p>Never was there seen a happier
family or better Christians; from
father to son, they were models. M.
le Marquis always remembered the
time when he was in poverty and
exile, obliged to earn his bread as a
simple workman. It made him kind
and compassionate to the poor, and,
consequently, he was adored by all
around him; and I have heard that
Madame la Marquise even surpassed
him in excellence and charity. Frequently
in the winter she was seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
visiting the cottages, followed by her
servants carrying bundles of wood
and bowls of soup, which she loved
to distribute herself to the most
needy.</p>

<p>Contrary to many great ladies, who
flock to the city for amusement and
gaiety in the winter, she made her
husband promise that they would
remain at Val-Saint during the entire
year; for, said she, "in summer
nearly every one has what is necessary;
but in winter there is much suffering
among the poor, and if we are
not at home to succor and relieve the
indigent, who will replace us?" You
will agree with me that she spoke as
a true Christian; and you will also
allow that if all our fine ladies
thought and acted in like manner,
they would gain in the benedictions
of the poor what they might lose in
pleasure, and it would certainly be
for the best. Between ourselves, M.
le Marquis did not give in very willingly
to this proposition; it was not
that the dear man was fond of foolish
dissipation; but after passing through
so much trouble, and having the
happiness to see his true king once
more on the French throne, he could
not resist the temptation of going to
Paris occasionally to salute him, and
was very desirous that madame
should appear at court. She always
excused herself on account of her
delicate health; and this reason, alas!
was only too true. Besides, she was
quick-witted, like all women, and,
without saying anything, saw that a
new revolution was not far off. M.
le Marquis, on the contrary, boldly
maintained that, as his dear masters
had only returned by a miracle,
they would not be off very soon
again. 1830 proved that our good
lady was right. After that, there was
no further talk about going to Paris;
but it was very sad at the château.
M. le Marquis became gloomy and
half sick from grief, and madame,
who had not been well for a long
time, felt that the blow would kill
her; in fact, she died shortly afterwards,
leaving a little daughter, ten
years old, and poor monsieur, very
lonely in his fine château.</p>

<p>As he feared God, he knew that a
brave Christian should not sink under
trials. By degrees he appeared resigned
to his fate, and resumed his
ordinary occupations. Besides the
care of his large estate, he hunted,
fished, and visited his good neighbors.
He gave large sums for the restoration
of our church and several
chapels in the neighborhood. All
this, and his great watchfulness over
the peasants who were his tenants,
made his time pass usefully. The
evenings were rather wearisome. Our
<i lang="fr">curé</i> noticed it, and frequently visited
the château towards dusk, so that he
could entertain him with the little
news of the district, and read the
public journals to him. They discussed
politics. When I say discussed,
it is only a way of speaking,
as the <i lang="fr">curé</i> and his lord always were
of the same opinion; but they could
regret the past together, and build up
new hopes for the future; and in that
manner bedtime came before they
knew it.</p>

<p>Little mademoiselle was brought up
very seriously, without companions
of her own age, or any amusements
suitable to her rank. She was under
the care of an old governess, named
Dame Berthe, who was tall and severe
in appearance, very well educated,
but so soft-hearted in regard to
her pupil she always said <em>amen</em> to all
her caprices, only regretting she could
not guess them beforehand.</p>

<p>M. le Marquis exercised no control
over his daughter; his great confidence
in Dame Berthe made him
refer everything to her. All that he
asked of mademoiselle was that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
should always look well and happy;
and in these two respects he had every
reason to thank the good God. As
for the rest, he used to say it would
take a very skilful person to find anything
to reprimand in such a sweet,
good girl; and there he was right.</p>

<p>All the petting in the world could
not spoil such a lovely nature, and
every year she became more attractive.
You may tell me there was
nothing very wonderful in that, since
she had all she desired. I will answer
that, on the contrary, many in
her place would have become for
that very reason wicked and disagreeable.
But mademoiselle inherited
from her departed mother, besides
a gentle and sweet face, a soul still
more gentle and sweet. She would
not have hurt a fly; her temper was
so equal it resembled the tranquil
water of a lake; she knew that she
was a rich heiress, and remained simple
in her manners, never haughty
to others, always ready to be of service,
and succeeded wonderfully in
calming monsieur, her father, who,
notwithstanding his goodness, was
liable sometimes to be carried away
with anger. Finally, I can say, without
extravagance, that this last
daughter of our dear lord's had, by
the grace of God, all the virtues of
her race united in her. Nevertheless,
as nothing on earth is absolutely perfect,
I must add that she had two
defects&mdash;one of body; for when she
was approaching her fifteenth year,
having grown too fast, it was very
evident that her spine was becoming
curved; and notwithstanding the
greatest medical skill was employed,
she became fearfully crooked. M.
le Marquis was greatly afflicted; but
as for her, she quickly made her decision.</p>

<p>"No one will want me," she said
sweetly; "and so, dear father, I will
always remain with you."</p>

<p>This idea consoled her perfectly.
Being lively and gay, she laughed
about her deformity so pleasantly
that the people of the château
ended by thinking it not the slightest
misfortune, quite as an accident
of the very least importance;
and, far from no one seeking her
hand, the suitors came in procession
to ask the honor of alliance with her.
She was too keen not to see that her
great wealth was the principal cause
of their eagerness, and consequently
refused all offers of marriage firmly
and decidedly; and on that point
the whole world could not make her
change her mind.</p>

<p>Her second defect was of the heart;
her great good-nature made her weak,
as she never knew how to refuse
when any one wept before her; neither
could she deny herself anything
where her innocent whims and caprices
were in question. It was certainly
a fault; for having in her own
hands wealth, power, and no superior
to control her, you can imagine that
her kindness of heart would make
her liable to fall frequently in the
pathway of life, and drag others after
her.</p>

<p>Now we will again take up the
story of the little Ragaudins at the
time when we left them.</p>

<p>You will remember that the foolish
little Jeannette was resolved not to
return to school, from shame of the
whipping she had received that day,
and was determined to go with the
willing Jean-Louis, and complain to
her godmother. They left the
farm the following morning at the
usual hour, passed right by the
priest's house, and slowly ascended
the slope before the château.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle had just come in
from Mass, and was sitting in the
parlor of the grand tower that overlooked
the whole country. Dame
Berthe was preparing her breakfast;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
for although there were in the anteroom
four or five big valets, who
passed their time in gossiping for
want of work, she thought no one
but herself was capable of pouring
the chocolate into the large silver
cup, and presenting it to her dear
mistress. Mademoiselle, as it happened,
felt a little bored that morning,
and gently reproached Dame Berthe
for not having found something to
amuse her.</p>

<p>"If I were not eighteen years old,"
said she, throwing herself in her big
arm-chair, "I would willingly play
with my doll. You have done well,
my poor Berthe; I feel like a little
girl, and mourn for my playthings.
What can you invent to-day? Father
went away last evening. I am
too tired to walk; tell me a story...."</p>

<p>Dame Berthe thought a moment;
but in regard to stories, she scarcely
knew any but those she had told
and retold a hundred times. Mercy
knows, that was not astonishing; two
persons who are always together,
know the same things, and have
never anything new to tell each
other.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle looked at her governess
laughingly, and took an innocent
delight in witnessing her embarrassment.
It was just at this
moment that the Ragaud children
emerged from the chestnut grove
before the château, and advanced
straight to the bridge that led to the
grand entrance.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle, who was rather
near-sighted, scarcely distinguished
the little things; but she heard the
wooden shoes, which went click-clack
on the stone bridge, and requested
Dame Berthe to see who it could be.</p>

<p>"It is little Jeanne of Muiceron,
and her brother, Jean-Louis, who
have doubtless come to make you a
visit," she replied; "for they are in
their Sunday clothes."</p>

<p>Here the good lady was mistaken;
for Pierrette held the holiday clothes
under lock and key, and would not
let them be worn on a week-day
without explanation.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle rose up joyfully; she
dearly loved her god-daughter and
all the Ragaud family, and, more
than that, in her frame of mind, it
was an amusement that came like a
gift from heaven.</p>

<p>"Make them come in, poor little
things," said she; "and I beg of you,
Berthe, to run to the kitchen, and
order cakes and hot milk, as I wish
them to breakfast with me."</p>

<p>Jean-Louis was the first to enter
the parlor. Jeannette kept behind
him, much less assured than you
would have imagined. Until now she
had scarcely ever seen her mistress,
except on Sunday, when coming out
from High Mass. Twice a year, on
New Year's day and the anniversary
of Jeannette's baptism, all the farm
came in great ceremony to present
their respects to monsieur and mademoiselle.
Besides this, the visits to
the château were very rare; and to
come alone, of their own free will,
and clandestinely, was something entirely
out of the usual run. Jeannette
began to understand all this, and felt
more like crying than talking.</p>

<p>Happily, mademoiselle took the
thing quite naturally, and asked no
questions. She kissed and caressed
her god-daughter, seated her on her
lap, and petted her so much that for
the first half-hour the little thing had
only permission to open her mouth
that the bonbons could be put in.</p>

<p>She thus had time to regain confidence,
and Jean-Louis, who feared to
hear her scolded, recovered his spirits.
Notwithstanding all this, both were
slightly overcome when mademoiselle,
after breakfast, suddenly asked
them if they had not some favor to
ask, promising to grant any request<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
on account of the trouble they had
taken in coming to visit her.</p>

<p>This was the critical moment.
Jeannet became red with embarrassment,
and the little girl appeared stupefied.
Dame Berthe gave her a
slight tap on the cheek, to encourage
her not to be ashamed before such a
good godmother; but that did not
untie her tongue.</p>

<p>"Speak now," said Jeannet, pushing
her with his elbow.</p>

<p>"Speak yourself," she replied in a
whisper. "I don't know what to say."</p>

<p>"What is it that is so difficult to
obtain?" asked mademoiselle. "Is it
something beyond my power?"</p>

<p>"Oh! no, no," said Jean-Louis.
"If mademoiselle wished, she has
only to say a word...."</p>

<p>"I will say it, my child; but still,
I must know what it is about."</p>

<p>"Very well, mademoiselle, this is
it&mdash;Jeanette does not wish to return
to school."</p>

<p>"She must be very learned, then," replied
mademoiselle, smiling. "Come
here, Jeanne; read me a page out
of this big book."</p>

<p>Only think of the blank amazement
and terror of Jeannette at that
moment! She did not know A from
B, and found herself caught like a
mouse in a trap. One last resource
was left&mdash;it was to burst into tears.
This was quickly done, and she was
heard sobbing behind her godmother's
arm-chair, where she had hidden
herself at the first mention of reading.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle, already very much
moved, profited by this incident, and
asked an explanation of the whole
affair, which Jeannet related, trying
his best to excuse the little thing.
Mademoiselle was very much amused
at the recital, and was weak enough,
instead of scolding Jeannette, to
praise her for her spirit. She replaced
her on her lap, wiped her tears, and,
without further reflection, decided the
case in her favor.</p>

<p>"But," said she, "I do not wish
my god-daughter to be as ignorant
as a dairy-maid. Isn't that true,
Jeanne? You will not make me blush
for you? I don't want you to go any
longer to Germaine's school, but it is
on condition that you be a good girl,
and learn to read and write. I will
teach you myself; how will you like
that?"</p>

<p>"O godmother!" cried the little
one, enchanted.</p>

<p>"Very well," replied mademoiselle;
"then it is all arranged. Jean-Louis
will return to Muiceron to tell
your parents, and in future I will
take care of you and teach you."</p>

<p>And it was thus that the good
young lady, without understanding
the consequence of her act, in an
instant changed the destiny of
Jeanne Ragaud. Dame Berthe
dared not object, although she saw
at a glance there was much to blame
in this decision. "Indeed, where the
goat is tied, there he should browse,"
said our <i lang="fr">curé</i>. Jeanne, the child of
peasants, should have remained a
peasant, instead of becoming the
plaything of a marquise. But mademoiselle's
intention was not bad; and,
for the time being, to have taken away
her distraction would have been cruel,
and Dame Berthe, although very
wise, had not the courage to do it.</p>


<h4>VII.</h4>

<p>In the village, every one had his
own idea on the subject. The Ragauds
were happy, and rather proud;
M. le Curé shrugged his shoulders,
keeping his remarks for a later period;
Germaine was silent; Jean-Louis
willingly sacrificed the company
of his little sister for what he
thought her greater good; and, for
the rest of the people, some said it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
was foolish, others that the Ragauds
were always lucky.</p>

<p>Jeannette was puffed up with joy
and pride. It is justice to say that
in a little while she became another
child; her mind was so well occupied
she lost all her wilfulness, devoted
herself to her studies, and was
no longer disobedient and rebellious.
M. le Marquis, enchanted to see his
daughter so happy in her new duties,
cheerfully approved of the measure,
and declared the château was a different
place after this humming-bird's
warbling was heard in the house.</p>

<p>As long as the summer lasted, the
thing went on without great inconvenience,
as the little one often went
home to sleep, and thus did not
entirely lose sight of her first destiny;
but with the bad weather, mademoiselle
feared she might take cold
by being so much exposed, and sent
word to the Ragauds that she would
keep her all the time.</p>

<p>Henceforward Jeannette was treated
like a daughter of the château.
She had her own little room, well
warmed, and a servant to obey her
orders; her hair was braided in
tresses that hung below her waist,
which soon made her discover that
she had the longest and thickest hair
of any child in the village. Her costume
was also changed. She had
fine merino dresses, prunella shoes
with rosettes, and the calico apron,
with big pockets, was replaced by a
little silk affair, which only served to
look coquettish. In the morning
she read with her godmother, or embroidered
at her side; after dinner
she drove out in an open carriage,
and on Sundays assisted at Mass and
Vespers, kneeling in the place reserved
for the château, whilst her
parents remained at the lower end of
the nave, admiring her from a distance.</p>

<p>In the village were some sensible
people, who openly condemned the
whole proceeding; especially Jacques
Michou, formerly a comrade in the
same regiment with Ragaud, and his
great friend, who one day, in virtue of
his long friendship, ventured a remonstrance
on the subject.</p>

<p>"You see," said he to Ragaud,
"the preferences of great ladies never
last long. Suppose mademoiselle
marries, or takes another caprice,
what will become of Jeanne, with
the habits of a nobleman's daughter?
She will not be able to wear wooden
shoes or dress in serge; and her
stomach will reject the pork, and
cabbage, and rye bread. As for her
mind, it will be pretty difficult ever
to make her feel like a peasant again.
Believe what I say, Ragaud, take
your daughter home; later she will
thank you, when her reason shall
have been matured."</p>

<p>It was certainly wise counsel; but
Ragaud had two reasons, sufficiently
good in his opinion, to prevent his
accepting such advice. In the first
place, he thought it a great honor to
see his daughter the friend and companion
of M. le Marquis. This came
from the heart on one side, as he was
devoted body and soul to the good
masters who had made his fortune;
but I would not swear, on the other
side, that it was not mingled with a
good deal of pride. Old Ragaud
was easily puffed up with vanity, and
sometimes at the wrong time, as will
be seen in the sequel.</p>

<p>The second reason was, he had
long been persuaded that mademoiselle
led too secluded a life.</p>

<p>"So many crowns, and so few
amusements," he often said. "Poor,
dear soul! it must be hard for her."</p>

<p>Therefore, he regarded as a fortunate
stroke her love for Jeannette;
and if it would have drawn down the
lightning from heaven on the roof of
Muiceron, he could not, as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
from conscience as from pity, have
deprived mademoiselle of the daily
pleasure that gave the busy-bodies
so much to talk about. And then,
it must be acknowledged that even
among our most intelligent farmers
there prevails a pernicious mania,
which pushes them to elevate their
children above themselves. They
thus act contrary to the designs of
God, who lets the seed fall where
the tree should grow; and against
themselves, as they are often, in the
end, humiliated by what should have
been their glory. But what can you
expect? A man is a man.</p>

<p>You cannot pour more water in a
pitcher than it will hold, and in a
head more truth than it can understand.</p>

<p>Ragaud was ill at ease when he
perceived mademoiselle's splendid
white horses draw up before the
church door. Only fancy that before
the eyes of the entire parish those
fine horses were used as much for
Jeannette as for the daughter of M.
le Marquis! It was precisely on a
Sunday, a little before High Mass,
that our friend, Jacques Michou, had
offered his good advice; the moment
was unpropitious, and Ragaud thus
replied to his old comrade:</p>

<p>"Friend Jacques, I thank you for
your words, as they are said with
good intention; but I nevertheless
believe that I have not arrived at
my age without knowing how to
manage my own affairs; which I say
without wishing to offend you. As
for dressing in serge, my daughter,
being my only child, will have enough
money to buy silk dresses if she
should desire them; and that will
not diminish her wealth. As for the
pork, do you think it never appears
on the tables of the nobility? Who
knows to the contrary better than I?
Twice a year M. le Marquis has a
supply from Pierrette. Thus, my
daughter will not lose at the château
the taste of the meals at the farm.
If we speak of rye bread, which is
certainly the ordinary country food,
we have ours half mixed with flour,
that makes the bread as fine as the
best made in the city. I can tell
you that mademoiselle will not refuse
it to Jeannette, as she often eats it
herself; in proof of which she frequently
sends to Muiceron for some,
without inquiring whether the flour
is fresh or stale. So you may rest
quiet, and let each one act as he
pleases."</p>

<p>And so, you see, without being impolite,
a man can be made to feel his
advice is despised.</p>

<p>We will now, if you please, leave
Jeannette to parade her fine dresses
in the château, like the linnets that
sing and hop in the sun, never caring
for sportsmen or nets, and return
to Muiceron and Jean-Louis.</p>

<p>I think the dear fellow thought
pretty much as Jacques Michou in
relation to the little one; but it was
in the secret of his heart, and, as his
friends appeared happy, he asked
nothing more. His character as a
child, so gentle and devoted, did not
change as he grew up. Different
from Jeannette, who became a young
lady without learning much, he remained
a peasant, but advanced in
knowledge like a schoolmaster. His
love of books did not interfere with
his rustic labors. After one year in
class, M. le Curé was obliged to teach
him alone, as he knew too much to
go with the others. But as Ragaud
could not do without an assistant on
the farm, and disliked to take a stranger,
Jeannet returned to Muiceron,
contented himself with one lesson on
Sunday, and studied by himself the
rest of the week.</p>

<p>After his first communion, which,
at his own request, was made rather
late, but with perfect comprehension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
and a heart filled with love, he became
still better. He was at that
time a fine boy of thirteen, larger
than usual for his age, with a handsome
face, brunette complexion, and
beautiful, large, dark eyes. M. le
Marquis remarked his distinguished
air, which meant that he did not
resemble the other young village
boys. The truth was, Jeannet, who
always had lived a peasant, had the
manner and bearing of a gentleman
dressed from caprice in a blouse;
and yet I can assure you it was
neither vanity nor pretension that
gave him that appearance.</p>

<p>Who would imagine that about
this time he nearly committed a
fault from excessive love of study?
And nevertheless, it so happened in a
way which you will soon understand.
One day, M. le Curé, wishing to
know how far this good child's mind
could follow his, amused himself by
explaining to him the Latin of his
Breviary. Jean-Louis caught at
this novelty like a fish at a bait. He
became passionately fond of the language,
and, as he had no time during
the day, gave up the greater
part of the night to its study. Now,
the young need good, sound sleep;
above all, when wearied with working
in the fields. Ragaud soon
understood it; I do not know how.
He was very angry, and was not altogether
wrong; for, besides the fact
that Jeannet lost flesh every day,
he was afraid of fire, as his room
was next to the grain-loft. Ragaud
scolded Jean-Louis; M. le Curé also
came in for his share of reprimand;
and for the first time these three
persons, who had always agreed so
perfectly, were very unhappy on
each other's account.</p>

<p>"If you wish to wear the cassock,"
said Ragaud to his son, "say it.
Although it will be a great sacrifice
for me to lose your company and
assistance, I will not prevent you
from following your vocation. But
if not, I beg of you to give up all
this reading and writing, which keeps
you up so late. I think that to tend
the cows and till the earth, the village
language is enough. You will know
one day that for you, more than for
others even, the work of the hands is
more useful than that of the mind."</p>

<p>Thereupon he turned his back,
and Jeannet, who was going to ask
his pardon, and assure him of his
submission, could not reply. As he
was very quick under his quiet manner,
he pondered all the rest of the
day upon his father's last phrase.
What did it mean? What was he to
know one day? What harm was there
in becoming learned, as he would
eventually be rich? The poor boy
suspected nothing; and yet from that
moment a secret and profound sadness
entered into his heart. He
bundled up his books, and took them
back to M. le Curé with many
thanks. Our <i lang="fr">curé</i> admired his obedience,
and Jeannet profited by the
opportunity to confide his grief to
his dear friend.</p>

<p>The good pastor reflected a moment.
It was, in truth, a great pain, and
one which he did not expect so soon,
to be obliged to confide to this child
the secret of his birth; but sooner or
later he must know it, and whether
to-day or to-morrow mattered little.</p>

<p>"My son," said he, "you are good
and reasonable; I hope your conduct
will never change. Sit down there
near me, and listen."</p>

<p>He related to him what we already
know. He did it with gentle and
holy words, fitted to pour balm into
the wound that he was forced to
make. He endeavored especially to
show forth the mercy of God and the
generosity of the Ragauds. Poor
Jeannet little expected such a blow;
he became pale as death and for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
instant appeared overwhelmed with
astonishment and grief. His head was
in a whirl; he rose, threw himself on
his knees, weeping and clasping his
hands. Our <i lang="fr">curé</i> let this first burst
of grief exhaust itself; and then, with
kind remonstrance, finished by proving
that, after all, grateful joy was
more seasonable than this great
affliction. How many in his place
had been abandoned, without parents,
without support, without instruction,
condemned to want and suffering,
and doubtless lost both for this world
and paradise? Instead of such a
fate, the good God had warmed the
little bird without a nest, had preserved
him from evil, had provided for his
wants; and now to-day, thanks to all
his blessings, he was, more than any
other, fitted to become a man worthy
to rank with those around him.</p>

<p>"It is true! it is true!" cried Jean-Louis.
"But how can I reappear at
the farm? Alas! I left it thinking
myself the son of the house, and I
will re-enter it a foundling!"</p>

<p>"There you do not speak wisely,
Jeannet," said our <i lang="fr">curé</i>; "you will
re-enter Muiceron such as you left it,
with the only difference that you are
now obliged to be still more obedient,
more industrious, and more devoted
to your parents than ever in
the past. It is not by having learned
the truth that your position is
changed; on the contrary, by not
knowing it, you ran the risk of injuring
it. When you believed yourself
the son of the house, you naturally
thought it allowable to follow your
inclinations, and act as you wished.
Now you must feel that is no longer
possible. 'An honest heart must
pay its debts.' I know your heart;
as for the debt, you see now how
important it is. Your life will not
suffice to pay it, but you can greatly
lessen it by taking upon yourself the
interests of your benefactors; by relieving
Ragaud, who is growing old,
of the heaviest work in the fields; by
caring for good Mother Pierrette, who
is a true soul of the good God; and
even by continuing to consider Jeannette
as your sister; which gives you
the right to offer her good advice.
For remember what I tell you: 'The
distaff is known by the wood'; which
means that it needs a strong ash-stick
to support a roll of hemp, whilst a
mahogany wand is only suitable for
silk. Hence, I warn you that Jeanne
Ragaud, after being accustomed to
display herself in the marquis' carriages,
will one fine day fancy herself
a silken distaff, and we will have to
untwist the thread."</p>

<p>"Jeanne will one day know I am
not related to her," said Jean-Louis,
weeping. "What then can I say to
her?"</p>

<p>"Why will she know it? It would
be useless to tell her. And besides, the
little thing's heart is not spoiled; she
will remember that you are the friend
of her childhood and her elder."</p>

<p>"Father Ragaud," replied Jeannet,
"told me this morning, if I wished
to wear the cassock, he would
not hinder me."</p>

<p>"Well, then?"</p>

<p>"Well, then, M. le Curé, if I am
ever sufficiently learned, can I not
aspire to that great favor?"</p>

<p>"Before our present conversation
would you have thought of it, Jeannet?"</p>

<p>"I believe not," replied he frankly,
lowering his head.</p>

<p>"Then, my boy, give up the idea.
To wear the cassock is, as you say, a
great favor; who knows it better than
I, who, after wearing it forty years,
acknowledge my unworthiness? But
you must not start on a road without
knowing where it leads; and the
cassock, taken through vexation or
disappointment, carries its wearer
direct to the path in which he walks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
with his back to heaven. You can
save your soul by remaining on the
farm, which I would not answer for
if you followed a vocation formed in
half an hour."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will remain a farm-laborer,"
said Jeannet; "that is my fate for all
time."</p>

<p>"You are vain, God pardon me!"
cried M. le Curé. "I never before
noticed this monstrous fault in you,
which has caused the loss of so many
of the best souls. Farm-laborer!
that means a tiller of the fields and
shepherd. My son, it is one of the
noblest positions in the world; it
was the calling of Abraham, of Jacob,
of the great patriarchs of the Bible,
that I wished you to imitate; and
they were not minor personages. If
I were not a priest, I would wish
to be a laborer; at least, I would
gather with my own hand the wheat
that I had planted, instead of receiving
it as the gift of a master, often a
capricious and bad Christian. Yes,
yes, my Jean, take care not to be
more fastidious than the good God,
who took his dear David, from minding
sheep, to be the ancestor of our
Saviour. And then, I will ask you,
how would your destiny be elevated
if you were really the legitimate child
of the Ragauds. Would you desire
to be greater than your father? And
what is he?"</p>

<p>Jeannet was convinced by all these
good reasons, uttered in rather a firm
tone, but which did not indicate displeasure.
He threw himself into the
<i lang="fr">curé's</i> arms, and acknowledged his
fault with a contrite and penitent
heart. His excellent good sense
showed him that, in reality, it was
only vanity that had made him speak
thus. He promised to return to
Muiceron, to preserve his secret, and
to be the model of field laborers.</p>

<p>Our <i lang="fr">curé</i> gave him his blessing,
and watched him, as he returned to
the farm, with much emotion. Ah!
if poor Catharine had known how to
sacrifice her self-love as her child
had just done, how different would
have been his fate! "But," sighed
the good pastor, "there will always
be frogs who will burst with the
ambition of becoming oxen; and if
the ox, who thought the frog foolish,
had known the elephant, undoubtedly
he would have acted in the same
manner. Poor human nature! poor
beasts! The true Christian is the only
wise man!"</p>

<h3>THE EVANGELICAL ALLIANCE.</h3>


<p>"We meet," said the Rev. Dr.
Adams, in his address of welcome
to the members of the Evangelical
Alliance in New York, "to manifest
and express our Christian unity.
Divers are the names which we bear,
both as to countries and churches&mdash;German,
French, Swiss, Dutch, English,
Scotch, Irish; Lutheran, Reformed,
Anglican, Presbyterian, Episcopal,
Methodist, Baptist, Independent&mdash;but
we desire and intend to
show that, amid all this variety of
form and circumstances, there is a
real unity of faith and life; believing,
according to the familiar expression
of our common Christian creed, in
the 'Holy Catholic Church and the
communion of saints.'" Dr. Adams
only gave expression to a thought
which was uppermost in the minds
of nearly all those five or six hundred
gentlemen who assembled in
this city from the four quarters of
the globe in the early part of October,
and filled the newspapers with
hymns and speeches, and professions
of love, and little disputes and quarrels.
"We are living," continued
Dr. Adams, "in times when, all over
the world, there is a manifest longing
for more of visible unity." So the
first business of the conference, after
the preliminary survey of the condition
of Protestantism in the midst of
the Catholic populations of Europe&mdash;the
review and inspection, so to
speak, of the army in the field&mdash;was
to devote a whole day to the discussion
of Christian unity, in the hope
of persuading themselves and the
rest of mankind that these warring
sects were really one body of Christian
believers, and this theological
battle, in which they pass fifty-one
weeks of the year, was nothing else
than the communion of saints. Indeed,
a day was not too long for such
a task. Anglicans and Baptists,
followers of John Wesley and disciples
of Calvin, the clergy of Calvary
and the preachers of the Greene
Street meeting-house, deans of the
English Establishment and dissenters
who hate prelacy as an invention of
the devil&mdash;they were all here together,
trying to agree upon something,
and to reconcile the fact of their
Alliance with the fundamental doctrine
confessed by Dr. Hodge, of
Princeton, as the motto of the conference
as well as the excuse for its
existence, that "The Church of
Christ is one." We say it was no
easy matter to reconcile the fact of
the Alliance with the confession of
this truth. An alliance supposes
independent forces, acting together
for a special and temporary purpose,
but preserving distinct organizations,
and acknowledging different commanders.
There can be no "alliance"
between the members of
the "one body in Christ," any
more than there can be an
alliance between the right and left
eyes, or the foot and the great toe.
Every one of the speakers was painfully
conscious of this false position.
"There is no more common reproach
against Christians," said Dr. Hodge,
"than that they are so much divided
in their belief. There is some truth
in this; but, my hearers, we are one
in faith." We confess we do not fully
comprehend the distinction. Matters
of faith, according to Dr. Hodge's
definition, seem to be those great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
truths which all members of the
Evangelical Alliance hold in common;
and matters of belief or opinion
are everything else. The existence
of God, the Trinity, the Incarnation,
the resurrection of the dead,
the punishment of hell, the rewards
of heaven, and a few other doctrines,
more or less&mdash;these are the Evangelical
articles of faith. But on what authority
does Dr. Hodge restrict his creed
to these few points? Every sect represented
in the Alliance has a more
or less extensive formulary of belief,
resting upon supposed divine revelation,
and including a good many
other tenets besides the half-dozen or
so held up by Dr. Hodge. All depend
upon precisely the same sanction.
All are supposed to be drawn
from the same source. The Baptist
has just the same ground for insisting
upon immersion that he has for believing
in the resurrection. The Calvinistic
doctrine of total depravity
has the same basis as the Calvinistic
belief in a divine Saviour. The
Anglican theory of an inspired but
occasionally corrupt and lying church
is just as well supported as the Anglican's
faith in the Trinity. What right
have the members of the Alliance to
decide that this dogma is a matter of
faith, and that other is only a matter
of opinion? All the contradictory
doctrines, they tell us, are found in the
Bible. Who has the right to decide
which are binding upon the conscience,
and which are open to individual
choice; which are certain, and
which are only probable? Oh! these
reverend gentlemen will tell us, the
essential points of faith are those upon
which we all agree. Very well. Whom
do you mean by "we"? What right
have you to restrict the company of
the faithful to your eight or nine sects?
You are not a majority of the Christians
in the world. You are even a
small minority of those who believe
in the very points which you make the
test of evangelical Christianity. There
are more than two hundred millions
of Christians who believe, just as you
do, in God, in the Incarnation, in the
resurrection, and in heaven and hell;
but you do not pretend to be one
body with them. If all who accept
what you style the points of faith are
fellow-members with you, why do you
not include Catholics? And, besides,
if you are to arrive at unity by a process
of elimination&mdash;throwing out one
dogma after another until you reach
a condition of theological indifferentism
where a certain number of sects
can meet without quarrelling&mdash;why
should you stop at one point rather
than another? There is no logical
reason why you should not eliminate
the doctrine of eternal punishment,
and take in the Universalists; or the
Trinity, and take in the Unitarians;
or Christian marriage, and take in
the Latter Day Saints; or the whole
Bible, and take in evolutionists, and
pure theists, and the prophets and
followers of free religion. Once begin
to make arbitrary discriminations
between faith and belief, as you now
do, calling everything upon which
your various denominations agree a
matter of ascertained truth, and everything
upon which they differ a subject
of individual opinion, and it
becomes impossible to say why your
common creed should not be narrowed
down to a single dogma&mdash;for
example, to the omnipotence of God,
or the existence of matter, or the
atomic theory, or the nebular hypothesis.
Then, at least, you would be
consistent, and your Alliance would
be a much more powerful body than
it seems to be at present.</p>

<p>This difficulty seems to have been
passed over by the Conference in
New York; but the fact of denominational
differences could not be forgotten.
It stared the meeting in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
the face at every turn. It got into
nearly all the speeches. It appeared
in almost every prayer. One after
another, the preachers and essayists
were moved to apologize for it and
explain it. Dr. Hodge laid down
the rule, with great applause from
his uneasy listeners, that any organization
formed for the worship of
Christ was a church, and every
church must be recognized by every
other; that churches differed so
radically about the great truths of
religion was no more to be wondered
at, and no more to be regretted,
than that men and women should be
organized into different towns, and
states, and nations; and, as a consequence,
he held that the sacraments
of one church were just as good as
the sacraments of another, and the
orders of one just as good as the orders
of another. In fact, said he,
"no church can make a minister any
more than it can make a Christian."
This remark was also received with
applause, in which it is to be hoped
that the Church of England delegates
and the Episcopalians cordially joined.
There were three bishops of the
Protestant Episcopal Church in the
Conference; and after the centuries
of war which their denomination has
waged for the validity of Anglican
orders and the unbroken apostolic
succession, it must have been an inexpressible
comfort to them to be
told by the Alliance that they were
no more bishops than Henry Ward
Beecher, and Octavius B. Frothingham,
and the Rev. Phœbe Hanaford.
They took it meekly, however, and
did not even mind being told that
their church could not make a bishop
or any other minister. The Dean of
Canterbury was there, as the representative
of the Primate of all England,
and he took the rather singular
position, for a churchman, that denominational
differences are rather
an advantage than otherwise. God's
works in nature, he said, are marked
by variety. All creation, from inanimate
objects up to man, is characterized
by diversity. So it is also,
he continues, with religions. The
parallel, of course, supposes that the
religions are imperfect and "natural"
works, which we hardly expected
an Anglican dean to admit. An
imperfect religion is one that is partly
true and partly false; that is to
say, it is a system of human devising,
and not a revelation from
God. And Dean Smith confesses
that all the churches embraced in
the Alliance are natural rather than
supernatural works when he accounts
for their diversities by the limitations
of human reason. "The gift of
instinct," he tells us, "is perfect, and
produces uniformity;" but "reason
is full of diversity." It is "tentative."
"It tries and fails, and tries
again, and improves its methods, and
succeeds partially, and so advances
indefinitely onward, and, it may be,
at times falls back, but never becomes
perfect." All this means, if it means
anything, that the cardinal points
of agreement between the so-called
Evangelical sects, or their faith, as
Dr. Hodge terms it, are the only
points of any creed which are not
subject to constant change. The
dogma which is professed to-day may
be repudiated to-morrow, and taken
up again next week. The creed for
which Cranmer went to the stake
may be denounced as heresy by the
Archbishop of Canterbury, and
preached as "moderately true" by
the Archbishop of York. In fine,
Anglicans get their faith in God and
the resurrection by instinct, and the
rest of the Thirty-nine Articles by reason;
and the result, of course, is that
the proportion of truth there may be
in religion is regulated entirely by the
intellectual capacity of the believer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
Salvation, according to this view, is
largely the result of a school education.</p>

<p>Moreover, says the dean, if we knew
just what to believe, we should
not take much interest in religion.
"Truth and the Bible are nowhere
valued, except where there is discussion,
and debate, and controversy
about them." It adds wonderful
zest to a dogma to have to dig for
it; and faith, like the biceps muscle,
is developed by violent contention.
But if this is so, what does the world
want of Evangelical Alliances? If
religious truth is only struck out in
the heat of religious wranglings, like
sparks from the contact of flint and
steel, the more fighting the better.
The Church of England must have
found out pretty much everything
worth knowing in the persecuting
days of Edward and Elizabeth, and
forgotten more than half of it in the
subsequent years of peace; while
the era of brotherly love, towards
which the Alliance looks with longing
eyes, will be a period of religious
indifference or of almost universal
negation.</p>

<p>Dean Smith is logical in one
thing. "If our state," he says, "is
not one of attainment, but one of
progress; if, at the most, we are feelers
and seekers after God," why,
then, of course, we must look upon
all denominations with equal favor.
One is just as good as another
where none has any faith. But
what, then, becomes of the Anglican
idea of a visible church and an
apostolic succession? Where is that
depository of divine truth to which
churchmen comfort themselves by
referring? What is the meaning of
that prayer in the litany of the
Anglican and Episcopal service,
"From heresy and schism good
Lord deliver us"? Dr. Hodge, indeed,
believes that "no church can
make a minister"; but the Protestant
Episcopal Church is very positive
and particular about its orders, and
is entirely satisfied that it can make
bishops, priests, and deacons; that
nobody else among Protestants can
make them; and that they are necessary
to the legitimate administration
of sacraments and the well-being of
Christian society. Pray, how are
these contradictions to be settled?
There was a charming illustration of
unity one Sunday during the sessions
of the Conference, when six
clergymen, representing five or six
different denominations, joined in a
celebration of the Lord's Supper at
the Madison Square Presbyterian
Church; and a very pretty row
there was about it afterwards. The
service was held in the afternoon,
and the company of celebrants included
the Dean of Canterbury (Anglican),
the Rev. Dr. Adams (Presbyterian),
the Rev. Matteo Prochet, of
Genoa (Waldensian), Narayan Sheshadri,
the Bombay convert, who has
been ordained, we believe, according
to the rite of the Free Church
of Scotland, Bp. Schweinitz (Moravian),
and Dr. Angus, of London
(Baptist). So far as we can understand
the ceremony, no particular
liturgy or custom was followed, but
the representative of each sect threw
in a little of his own religion. Dr.
Adams opened the exercises with a
prologue. The dean followed with
an apology, and then read the Apostles'
Creed and a collect from the
<cite>Book of Common Prayer</cite>. Dr. Angus
"gave thanks for the bread," his
prayer serving, apparently, instead
of a consecration. Then the bread
was handed around by the lay deacons
of the church. "Bp. Schweinitz
was called on to give thanks for
the cup, which was afterward passed
to the congregation." After some
further address, the dean dismissed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
the assemblage with a benediction.
We can understand how the various
dissenting ministers might reasonably
take part in such a ceremony;
but the spectacle of a dignitary
of the Church of England in such a
situation would be incomprehensible,
had not long experience taught us
that all manner of amazing and inconsistent
things are to be looked
for in the Anglican Church as matters
of course. No sooner had the story
of this joint-communion service appeared
in the newspapers than the
bubble of Christian unity burst with a
tremendous report. An ex-bishop of
the Anglican Establishment, the Right
Rev. Dr. Tozer, of Central Africa,
who happened to be in New York,
addressed a letter of remonstrance to
the Protestant Episcopal bishop of
this diocese. He was shocked at the
dean's breach of ecclesiastical order,
and terrified at the consequences
which might follow his rash and
insubordinate conduct. If one service
is just as good as another, why
naturally, says Bp. Tozer, people
will run after the attractive worship
of the Church of Rome; and "the
promise held out by the Episcopal
Church in this land, of becoming a
haven of rest to men who are tossed
to and fro by the multiplicity of
contending creeds and systems, is
nothing else than a mistake and a
delusion." Dr. Tozer's letter found
its way into the newspapers; and
then a bitter controversy broke out
among the Episcopalians, bishops,
priests, and laymen berating one another
in the secular press, and striving
in vain to determine whether
their church was a church or not.
Only one thing seems to have been
finally settled by the quarrel, and
that was, that on two of the most important
of religious questions&mdash;one
relating to the very foundation of
the visible church organization, the
other to the most solemn of religious
rites&mdash;the Anglican denomination has
no fixed belief at all. That very dignified
and exclusive body, which sets
so much store by the apostolical
succession, and has strained history
and reason for so many years to establish
the validity of its own orders,
has practically treated ordination as
a thing of no consequence whatever.
It has admitted Presbyterian preachers
to its benefices, and recognized
the validity of priestly functions performed
by men to whom it denies
the priestly character; and the best
explanation its defenders can give
of such inconsequent conduct is
that the "intrusion of unordained
persons into English livings" was
one of the "irregularities of the
Reformation period." (See letter
of "Theologicus" to the New York
<cite>Tribune</cite> of Oct. 20, 1873.) With
regard to the Lord's Supper, the
position of the Anglican and Protestant
Episcopal Churches is still
more curious. All the members of
those two organizations believe it to
be a sacrament of peculiar, if not
awful, sacredness. The majority probably
hold that the body and blood
of our Lord, in some mysterious and
indefinite way, are communicated to
the devout receiver of the consecrated
bread and wine, if they are not
literally present with the visible elements;
and some High Churchmen
actually believe in the real presence.
Yet, in the face of all this, we find
the Episcopal Church admitting that
the proper celebration of the Lord's
Supper does not require the intervention
of a regularly ordained minister.
Any kind of a service will do, and
any kind of a celebrant, even a layman.
It is a great mistake to suppose,
as some Episcopalians did, that
there was anything novel or unbecoming
in the Dean of Canterbury's
participation with heretics in the per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>formance
of a mutilated and nondescript
service. The Dean of
Westminster (Dr. Stanley) did a
similar thing at the meeting of the
Evangelical Alliance in Berlin in
1859, and an overzealous churchman
who complained of it to the
Archbishop of Canterbury was rebuked
for his pains. Dr. Muhlenberg,
one of the leading Protestant Episcopal
clergymen of this city, expressed
the only logical Protestant view of
the joint communion question in an
address before the Alliance on the
last day of its meeting. The Lord's
Supper, according to Dr. Muhlenberg,
is "the highest social act of religion,"
and the custom of restricting its celebration,
each denomination to itself,
is in the highest degree objectionable.
As a matter of convenience, it is better,
as an ordinary rule, that communicants
should have their own
"church homes, so to call them,
where, under their own pastors, and
amid their families and friends, they
feel it a good and pleasant thing so
to participate in the sacred feast.
They have an indisposition to go for
it beyond these companies of immediate
brethren. Nor is this unsocial, if
it be merely a preference for their
own associations, for the sacramental
modes and customs to which they,
like their fathers before them, have
been accustomed; but when they
do it on religious grounds, when they
make it a matter of conscience, when
they would forego the communion
altogether rather than partake of it
outside of their own societies, then it
is that unsocialness, to call it by its
mildest name, which it is hard to
reconcile with aught of hearty realization
of membership in the one
body of Christ."</p>

<p>Dr. Muhlenberg's position is so
peculiar that we have given his statement
of it in his own language, lest
we may be accused of misrepresenting
him. It never occurred to us to
complain of heresy and schism on the
ground that they are "so unsociable,"
and we never supposed that the most
liberal of Protestant sects defended
denominationalism on the plea of
custom and education. The manner
of taking communion, according to
Dr. Muhlenberg, seems to be as much
the result of habit as anything else&mdash;like
the manner of dining or chewing
tobacco. An Episcopalian has
no better reason for kneeling reverently
at the chancel-rail, and consuming
the consecrated bread and
wine, rather than sitting at ease in
his pew while unconsecrated food
and drink are passed to him by lay
deacons, than the reason that he was
brought up to that fashion, and feels
more comfortable in the society of
his own friends and neighbors. This
being the case, it follows, of course,
that the bread and wine are just as
good without consecration as with it;
just as much the body and blood of
Christ in the bakery and the wine-shop
as on the altar; and the most
rigorous Anglican will be entirely
justified in communicating according
to any rite that he fancies. Indeed,
Dr. Muhlenberg declares that the
various sacramental rites and ceremonies
are all more or less agreeable
to Scripture, but not essential. The
sacrament is just as good without
any of them. Our Lord commanded
us to celebrate the holy communion
in remembrance of him.
Well, then, let us go and do it, each
in his own way, each after his own
idea of what it means, each admitting
that every other way is good, and
perfectly indifferent to the tremendous
question whether the elements
are the body and blood of the Saviour
or only common bread and wine.
Nay, there is no need of an officiating
ministry. The Christian eucharist is
only the antitype of the Jewish Pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>over;
and as "an officiating ministry
was not required for the ancient
priestly dispensation, surely none can
be demanded for the antitype under
the unpriestly dispensation of the
Gospel." That simplifies the administration
very much; but it occurs to
us that a sincere Episcopalian, of less
liberal views than Dr. Muhlenberg,
might be embarrassed by the joint
communions which he so strongly
recommends. We can imagine such a
man going into Dr. Adams's church,
while the Dean of Canterbury, and
the Presbyterian and Baptist, and
other ministers, stood grouped together
before the pulpit, and asking
what the ceremony meant. A deacon
answers, "Oh! it is nothing but the
communion service; you had better
join us." "But what is your communion
service? Is it the participation
of the body and blood of Christ?"
"Not at all; it is merely the highest
social act of religion." "Have the
bread and wine been consecrated?"
"Oh! yes&mdash;that is to say, no; well, you
see, these gentlemen don't all think
alike about it. One says it is the
sacrament of the body and blood of
Christ, and another says it is nothing
but a rite of hospitality; and we let
every man choose for himself." "But
has there been no blessing of the
elements? No prayer over them?"
"Yes; a plenty of prayers." "And
what was the intention of the celebrant?
The intention, of course,
regulates the quality of the act."
"Oh! there were five or six intentions;
for there were five or six celebrants,
and no two of them meant
the same thing." Here the inquirer,
if he had any sense, would probably
conclude that the ceremony was
nothing but a sacrilegious travesty
on the holy communion, and would
retire deeply scandalized; and remembering,
first, that the Thirty-nine
Articles of his creed forbid "any man
to take upon him the office of ministering
the sacraments before he be
lawfully called and sent to execute
the same," and, secondly, that the preface
to the ordination service of the
Episcopal Church declares that no
man shall be suffered to execute any
of the functions of a minister in
Christ's church except he be duly
ordained by a bishop, he will doubtless
be not a little puzzled to account
for the presence of a dignitary like
the Dean of Canterbury in such a
motley assemblage.</p>

<p>The protests against joint communion
are not confined, however, to
the Episcopal denomination. The
Baptists are likewise exercised in
mind about it. They refuse to recognize
the validity of infant baptism,
or to admit to the Lord's Supper
those who have not been duly baptized;
and hence, with the great
majority of Christians they do not
feel at liberty to communicate. The
Baptist clergyman from London who
participated in the performance at
Dr. Adams's church has exposed himself
to violent criticism from his own
brethren, and, like Dean Smith, is
accused of forgetting ecclesiastical
discipline and theological orthodoxy
under the impulse of a moment of
gushing enthusiasm. What a charming
illustration of Christian unity
this joint-communion service has
afforded!</p>

<p>The more closely we look into the
Alliance, the more preposterous appear
its attempts to jumble up conflicting
doctrines, mingle contradictions, and
confuse intelligence. If it is right
for different sects to communicate
together, it must be right for them to
perform all other religious services
together, and doctrine and ritual become
alike insignificant. Hence, we
are not surprised to find among the
papers presented to the Conference
an essay on the <em>Interchange of Pul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>pits</em>,
in which the Rev. Mr. Conrad,
of Philadelphia, argues that it is a
Christian duty for Episcopal congregations
sometimes to listen to the
sermons of Baptist preachers, and for
Baptists to invite the ministrations
of a Presbyterian, and so on&mdash;hands
across, down the middle and up
again; orthodox to-day, heretic next
week. Is it necessary to believe
anything? Is there any such thing
as faith? Is there any reality in
religions which have no dogmas,
and which look upon truth and
falsehood, worship and blasphemy, as
perfectly indifferent? Surely this is
reducing Protestantism to absurdity.
You gentlemen have adopted the
principle of individual infallibility,
first, to declare that the church of
God is the mother of falsehood, and
then to accuse each other of error
and deceit; and after multiplying
your subdivisions till there is danger
of universal ruin and dissension, you
come together and declare that there
is no such thing as religious certitude;
no choice between one sect
and another; no difference between
God's messengers and the lying
prophets of Baal. Your plan of
composing controversies is to obliterate
the distinction between good
and evil; and if we can believe Mr.
Conrad, the plan of the apostles
was the same. They founded independent
congregations, and gave
them such lax notions of faith that,
as Mr. Conrad remarks, "the primitive
church was inoculated with error."
Nevertheless, the apostles
and their first disciples went about
freely from church to church, exchanging
pulpits, so to speak; and
we do not read that the denomination
to which Peter belonged had any
objection to an occasional sermon
from Paul, or that the Beloved Disciple
was not welcomed as a good
Christian minister when he visited
the sect established by S. Luke. In
those blessed days there was, we believe,
a true interchange of pulpits.
But Mr. Conrad neglects to explain
the warning which S. Paul gave to
the Christians at Rome:</p>

<p>"Now I beseech you, brethren, to
mark them who cause dissensions
and offences contrary to the doctrine
which you have learned; and to
avoid them.</p>

<p>"For they that are such serve
not Christ our Lord, but their own
belly: and by pleasing speeches,
and good words, seduce the hearts
of the innocent."<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>What have the Episcopalians, with
their fiction of a hierarchy, to say of
this plan of undenominational preaching?
How are we to reconcile the
presence of a Presbyterian parson in
one of their pulpits with the rule, already
quoted, which forbids the exercise
of ministerial functions by one
who has not received Episcopal ordination?
And what would a Baptist
say to a service conducted in
one of their churches by a Methodist
who had been sprinkled in infancy,
and therefore, according to the Baptist
view, not baptized at all?</p>

<p>The plain truth of the whole matter
is that there is no such thing as
Christian unity in any of these periodical
performances of the Evangelical
Alliance. The sects are not
drawing closer together. Denominational
differences are not disappearing.
The quarrelling is as angry and
as noisy as ever. But Protestantism
has taken alarm. It is confronted
by two dangerous enemies, which are
growing stronger and stronger every
day, and it is anxious to keep the
peace for a little while in its own
family, that it may the better look
after its defence. One of these dangers
is the philosophical infidelity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
which Protestantism itself has bred.
The other is the Catholic faith, against
which Protestantism is a rebellion.
An address, prepared by the late
Merle d'Aubigné for the conference
which was to have been held three
years ago, was presented at the meeting
in New York. The historian of
the Reformation tells his brethren
some plain and unwelcome truths
about their condition. "The despotic
and arrogant pretensions of Rome,"
he says, "have reached in our days
their highest pitch, and we are consequently
more than ever called upon
to contend against that power which
dares to usurp the divine attributes.
But that is not all. While superstition
has increased, unbelief has done
so still more.... Materialism and
atheism have in many minds taken
the place of the true God. Science,
which was Christian in the finest intellects
of former days, in those to
whom we owe the greatest discoveries,
has become atheistic among men who
now talk the loudest.... Eminent
literary men continually put forward
in their writings what is called positivism,
rejecting everything that goes
beyond the limit of the senses, and
disdaining all that is supernatural....
Unbelief has reached even the ministry
of the word. Pastors belonging
to Protestant churches in France,
Switzerland, Germany, and other
Continental countries, not only reject
the fundamental doctrines of the
faith, but also deny the resurrection
of Jesus Christ, and see in him
nothing more than a man who, according
to many among them, was
even subject to errors and faults. A
Synod of the Reformed Church in
Holland has lately decreed that, when
a minister baptizes, he need not do it
in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost.... At
an important assembly held lately in
German Switzerland, at which were
present many men of position, both
in the church and state, the basis of
the new religion was laid down: 'No
doctrines' was the watchword on that
occasion; 'no new doctrines, whatever
they may be, in place of the old;
liberty alone.' Which means liberty
to overthrow everything; and too
truly <em>some of those ministers believe
neither in a personal God nor in the
immortality of the soul</em>." Nor was
Merle d'Aubigné alone in his bitter
judgment of European Protestantism.
The same feeling is more or less
clearly manifest in the essays of various
foreign delegates. Mr. Prochet,
the Waldensian minister from Genoa,
in presenting a sketch of the religious
condition of Italy, laid great stress
upon the close union, brotherly feeling,
and unflagging energy of the
priesthood. "The clergy," said he,
"with few exceptions, have gathered
themselves more closely around the
Holy See, determined to stand or
fall with it." Father Hyacinthe lectured
in Rome; "but the clergy left
him alone, or his few adherents were
such that nothing of any importance
could be done by them." Among
the laity there is a large proportion
of devout adherents of the church.
There is a great multitude which does
not practise any religion, and takes
more interest in politics than in faith;
but this party has not renounced its
allegiance to the church, and believes
in Rome as far as it believes in anything.
Atheists are not numerous, but
their influence is constantly increasing.
Protestants are the fewest and
the weakest of all. There are congregations
of foreign Protestants, but
"their influence is of very little value."
The Waldensians have a theological
school at Florence; but we are puzzled
to know what they can teach, for "it
is open to students of every denomination;
they are never asked to leave
their religion to join another." Alto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>gether,
the Protestants of Italy, mere
handful as they are, are divided into
ten different denominations. The
Rev. M. Cohen Stuart, of Rotterdam,
gave a somewhat similar sketch of the
situation in Holland. Nowhere, he
said, has the Pope more pious devotees
and more zealous adherents
than in the land which gave England
William of Orange and sheltered the
Pilgrim Fathers. If the church is
not increasing there in numbers, it is
daily adding to its power and influence.
"There is no rent of heresy
in the solid mass of that mediæval
building save the remarkable schism
of the so-called Jansenists; ... but
this sect, with its few thousands of adherents,
is far more interesting from its
history than important from actual influence."
Protestantism, on the other
hand, shows little but dissension, with
a strong tendency towards scepticism.
"There is a tide of neology, a flood
of unbelief, which no dikes or moles
can keep back.... A great many,
a sadly increasing number, are more
or less forsaking the Gospel and becoming
estranged from Christian
truth. Materialism and irreligion
are slaying their tens of thousands in
the ranks of so-called Christians."
Mr. Stuart draws a fearful picture of
the disputes of the different Protestant
theological schools, and continues:
"It is evident, indeed, that
the utter confusion into which the
Reformed Church of Holland has
fallen cannot last very long, lest it
should lead to a total disorganization
and overthrow of the whole....
Nothing for this moment is left but
to bear, though not without earnest
protest, a state of things too abnormal
and too absurd to last." Of
Switzerland, again, we have almost
precisely the same story. The Rev.
Eugene Reichel, of Montmireil, complained
of the activity of the Catholic
Church in his little republic, and
the great increase of infidelity among
Protestants. "A deplorable unbelief
has led captive the masses of the
people. They have left their churches
to engulf themselves in the vortex
of business and worldly pleasure....
On every side infidelity is become
rampant, and much more aggressive
than in former years. Better organized
than once, and finding an efficient
support both in the indifference
of the people and the countenance
afforded by government, this insidious
foe, closing up its ranks, is not
slow to assail the truth." Of Spain
Mr. Fliedner gave a vague and not
over-brilliant account, and of Greece
Mr. Kalopathakes could only say
that Protestants had a very hard time
of it there, and that there were very
few of them. American missionaries
have been sustained in Greece for
forty years, and yet there is only
one meeting-house in the kingdom.
Mr. Decoppet, of Paris, declares that
"the Protestant population of France
is still but a feeble minority, which
holds its own, but does not sensibly
increase," while the church is evidently
gaining every day in influence;
and, moreover, Protestantism is torn
by internal discords, and weakened
by rationalistic tendencies, which
give its enemies "a plausible pretext
for their assertion that Protestantism
leads necessarily to negation,
and that it is on the high-road to
dissolution." In Denmark, according
to Dr. Kalkar, of Copenhagen,
Catholicism has made rapid and extraordinary
progress. In Protestant
Sweden, "unbelief has spread among
the people, especially among the
educated classes," and "the moral
condition of the people is tolerably
low."</p>

<p>Upon the discussion of the various
methods proposed in the conference
to combat the enemies of Protestantism
we do not know that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
need linger. Infidel philosophy engaged
most of the attention of the
German and American delegates;
but how could Protestantism do battle
with its own offspring? The debate
on the Darwinian theory was
empty&mdash;nay, it was almost childish.
The essays on the same subject were
timid and inconsequential. And
strange to say, when the day for demolishing
the Pope of Rome came
around, the fiery, aggressive spirit
which animated the Alliance in former
days was wanting. There were rumors
of dissatisfaction among the brethren
at the time-honored attitude of
the Evangelical Alliance towards the
Scarlet Woman of Babylon; and it
was thought that while atheism was
so rife, and faith so weak, and Protestantism
dying, so to speak, of
inanition, it was unwise to quarrel
with any kind of Christianity which
seemed able to arrest the downward
progress. Those who judged thus
instinctively felt, what they would be
slow to acknowledge, that between
the Catholic Church and no faith at
all there is not a middle position.
The whole Conference teaches the
same truth. Protestantism drifts
away into the darkness and the storm,
but the Rock of Peter stands immovable,
the same yesterday, and to-day,
and for all time.</p>

<p>"Upon this rock will I build my
church, and the gates of hell shall
not prevail against it."</p>

<h3>CATHOLIC LITERATURE IN ENGLAND SINCE THE
REFORMATION.</h3>


<p class="center">CONCLUDED.
</p>

<p>After the death of Alexander
Pope, in 1744, it was a long time before
English Catholic literature could
boast of any living name. Prelates,
indeed, and priests there were, whose
admirable writings circulated among
their co-religionists, but few who were
known to the public generally as
successful aspirants for literary fame.
Yet the devotional and controversial
writings of the time&mdash;the works, for
example, of Bps. Hay, Challoner,
and Milner&mdash;took no mean part in
the cultivation of the intellect and
taste. The influence of classical
authors from without was discoverable
in their style, and they kept pace
in general with the enlarged experience
of the age. There is no philosophy
so deep as Catholic philosophy;
none so comprehensive, affecting, and
complete. It embraces all other
philosophies so far as they are sound;
and far from being at variance with
any branch of human science, it incorporates
all knowledge into itself
as parts of a system of universal
truth. It is the philosophy of life
and of society; the philosophy of the
soul, her joys and sorrows, her aspirations
and ends. It solves all the
questions which vex the inquiring
spirit, so far as it is possible for them
to be solved under our present conditions
of being. Catholic philosophy,
under this point of view, is set forth
in the most touching manner by
Bp. Challoner in his <cite>Meditations for
Every Day in the Year</cite>. Apart from
the edifying character of these reflec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>tions,
it is impossible to read them attentively
without allowing them distinct
literary merit. While they evince
a tenderness and pathos that are sure
to win on the reader's heart, they
exhibit also much art in composition.
The sentences are well balanced and
musical; the subject is always exposed
methodically; and the appeals,
however addressed to the feelings,
are controlled by strict reasoning.</p>

<p>Take, again, Bp. Milner's <cite>End
of Controversy</cite>&mdash;a series of letters
addressed to the Protestant Bishop
of St. David's. It is a complete
armory. If Dr. Challoner's <cite>Meditations</cite>
was fitted to implant the
divine philosophy of Catholicism
deeply in the breast, Dr. Milner's
<cite>End of Controversy</cite> was no less calculated
to arm the sincere Catholic
with every needful weapon of defence
against the assailants of his creed.
If luminous arrangement, clear
reasoning, and profound learning
constitute claims to literary merit,
that book possesses it in no ordinary
degree. Edition after edition has
been published, and it has been produced
in so cheap a form as to be
accessible to readers in the humblest
circumstances. Though the face of
controversy between Catholics and
Protestants has much changed of
late years in England, firstly by the
Anglo-Catholic or Tractarian movement,
and, secondly, by the wide
spread of infidel opinions under the
form of positivism, yet the old arguments
in support of Catholicism remain
unchanged, and there are few
cases of heavy resistance which Dr.
Milner's letters will not meet even
now. Ingenious additions and variations
have been made by subsequent
controversialists to supply passing
needs, but, after all, these grand old
field-pieces, when brought fairly into
line, will be found equal to the task of
demolishing any bench of Protestant
bishops and any assembly of Presbyterian
elders.</p>

<p>The <cite>Lives of the Saints</cite>, by the Rev.
Alban Butler, appeared for the first
time in 1754, ten years after Pope's
death. The venerable author was
Principal of the English College at
St. Omer, then the principal seminary
for English ecclesiastics. The
wide celebrity of the work, and the
fact of its having been made a reference-book
in every good Catholic
library, render it needless to dwell on
its excellences. Suffice it to say that
it exhibits a profound acquaintance
with the subjects of which it treats,
and preserves a wise medium between
credulity and disbelief. The copious
notes, containing accounts of the
writings of sainted fathers and doctors,
are invaluable to literary men;
and the <cite>Lives</cite> in general shows that
the author's knowledge and research
extended far beyond the bounds of
theology, hagiology, and church history.
His nephew, Charles Butler&mdash;himself
a well-known literary character&mdash;published
an <cite>Account of the Life
and Writings of the Rev. Alban Butler</cite>,
in which he gives, as nearly as possible,
a list of the principal works and sources
from which the author of the
<cite>Lives of the Saints</cite> derived his information.
He then goes on to say
that literary topics were frequently
the subject of his uncle's familiar
conversation, and quotes from memory
many of his criticisms on Herodotus,
whose style he greatly admired,
Cicero, Julius Cæsar, the works
of Plato, and the modern Latin
poems of Wallius, together with the
relative merits of the sermons of
Bossuet and Bourdaloue.</p>

<p>Charles Butler always took a laudable
pride in dwelling on his uncle's
merits, and in making them better
known to the public. To his editorship
is owing the publication of the
<cite>Notes</cite> of Alban Butler's travels during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
the years 1744-46. He informs us in
a short preface that in many places
they were little more than mere
jottings, and not intended for publication;
that their meaning, also, was
frequently difficult to decipher. By
his care and diligence, however, they
were brought into a readable form;
and the volume, published in Edinburgh
in 1803, and now rarely to be
met with, is valuable as showing the
highest degree of knowledge of Italian
ecclesiastical affairs then attainable
by a cultivated and inquiring
traveller. Seldom has a book of
travels had more facts condensed into
it. It is a monument of close observation;
and at a time when handbooks
were very few and very imperfect,
it must have been a precious
<i lang="la">vade mecum</i> in the hands of Catholic
travellers, and particularly ecclesiastics.
The writer seems, in every
spot he visited, to have gathered up
all that could be collected respecting
it either from books or individuals.
The amount of statistics is enormous,
and the attention to details truly
laudable. Had these <cite>Travels</cite> been
written for the public, and graced
with the flowing style and the free
and copious reflections which abound
in the <cite>Lives of the Saints</cite>, they would
have been read frequently to this
day, and have ranked high among
compositions of a similar kind.</p>

<p>The writings of Charles Butler are
of no mean value, in consequence of
his having directed his attention to
English Catholic history at a time
when scarcely any other writers
thought it worth their while to obtain
accurate information on the subject,
and still less to record it for the benefit
of others. Charles Butler made
it his business to preserve everything
of importance which he could collect
respecting the political and religious
condition of his co-religionists in
England since the time of the Reformation;
and all subsequent historians
have, in such matters, been greatly
indebted to his <cite>Historical Memoirs</cite>
and <cite>Reminiscences</cite>. His style, it is
true, is very sketchy, and his matter
reads like notes and memoranda; but
the intrinsic value of what he places
on record atones in some measure
for this defect. In his opinions he inclined
rather to the liberal school of
thought, and this fact brought him
into serious collision with Bp. Milner
on the subject of the veto and
other matters then in debate. There
can, however, be no doubt of his
sincere attachment to the Catholic
religion, while his love of literature
and all that concerns mental progress
is no less apparent in his works.
Acquainted as he was with most of
the distinguished men of the day, he
had ample opportunities of observing
their peculiar gifts and habits. The
remarks which he makes in his <cite>Reminiscences</cite>
on the parliamentary eloquence
of Chatham, North, Fox, Pitt,
and their compeers, whom he had
seen and heard, have this merit, that
they were derived from no second-hand
sources. His <cite>Horæ Biblicæ</cite>,
<cite>Germanic Empire</cite>, <cite>Horæ Juridicæ</cite>,
his numerous biographies, his <cite>Historical
Memoirs of the Church of
France</cite> and of <cite>English, Irish, and
Scottish Catholics</cite>, were not merely up
to the standard of his time, but often
beyond it, in consequence of the
peculiarity of the materials that he
brought together. While he was
familiar with a wide range of literature,
English, foreign, and ancient,
he was also conversant with algebra,
music and other fine arts. The
motto he adopted for his <cite>Reminiscences</cite>
from D'Aguesseau shows his love
of study: <i lang="fr">Le changement de l'étude
est toujours un délassement pour moi</i>&mdash;"A
change of study is always a relaxation
for me." If he is sometimes formal
and verging on priggishness&mdash;as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
when he styles himself all through
two volumes "the Reminiscent"&mdash;the
fashion of his day, which was far
more stilted than we should approve,
must be his excuse. If we had enjoyed
the pleasure of his acquaintance,
we should, no doubt, have pronounced
him "a gentleman of the
old school."</p>

<p>The Rev. Joseph Berington was
another Catholic of the last century
who has embalmed his memory in a
useful work. Charles Butler wrote
of his <cite>Literary History of the Middle
Ages</cite>: "It presents the best account
in print of that important subject."
The <cite>Biographie Universelle</cite>, that Pantheon
of genius, contains a very imperfect
but interesting monument to
his memory. He was a contemporary
of Charles Butler, and a link in the
chain of English Catholic authors
since the great overthrow of religion.
Between the years 1776 and 1786, he
published several controversial works
directed against infidelity and Protestantism.
He then published the
<cite>History of Abelard and Heloise</cite>, with
the genuine letters of those around
whom Pope's poem had thrown much
romantic interest. It soon reached a
second edition, and was followed by
a <cite>History of Henry II. and his Two
Sons</cite>, vindicating the character of S.
Thomas à Becket. But it was not
till 1814 that he published the work
on which his reputation mainly rests,
<cite>The Literary History of the Middle
Ages</cite>. By that time his experience
had matured, and he had collected a
large body of materials from numberless
sources. His work, when it appeared,
was the best compendium to
be found; but since that period the
researches of Maitland, Kenelm Digby,
and many others have thrown
open to our view more clearly the fair
fields and wealthy mines of mediæval
lore. This volume served as a stimulus
to the inquiries of other students,
and it was thought worthy of republication
so late as 1846. What we
admire in it is the taste of the writer
and his genuine love of the subject
on which he treats. He does not
write like a dry bibliographer, but in
a genial way&mdash;like one whose learning
has not eaten out his individual human
heart.</p>

<p>But the merit of Berington and
Charles Butler fades into insignificance
when compared with that of
Lingard. Before his time, English
history was almost unknown. The
Catholic side of a number of questions
had never been fairly presented,
and the true sources of history had
either not been discovered, or were
very scantily resorted to. It was Dr.
Lingard who first made the public
sensible of the value of documents
brought to light by the Record Commission;
the Close and Patent Rolls
extant in the Tower; the Parliamentary
writs; the papers and instruments
of the State Paper Office; the
despatches of De la Mothe Fénelon,
the French ambassador in London in
the reign of Elizabeth; the letters
and speeches of Oliver Cromwell;
and the archives of the <cite>Ministère des
Affaires Etrangères</cite> in France. Accustomed
as we now are to see history
written by the lights of such incontestable
evidence, we often wonder
how our forefathers could have accepted
with complacency the jejune
records founded in too many cases
on tradition and fancy. To Dr. Lingard
and Miss Strickland is principally
due the praise of having introduced
a more respectable and reliable
method.</p>

<p>Historians generally train themselves
unconsciously for their larger
works by the composition of some
smaller ones. It was thus with Lingard,
who published, in 1806, his
<cite>Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon Church</cite>,
and lived to watch over its success,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
and improve it in numerous editions,
during a period of forty-five years.
He availed himself gladly of the
labors of other workers in the historic
field, and saw, with singular pleasure,
the laws, charters, poems, homilies,
and letters of our Anglo-Saxon ancestors
collected and published. But no
work on the Anglo-Saxon portion of
English history is more valuable and
interesting than his own. He causes
the church of that epoch to live before
us with its laws, polity, doctrines,
sacraments, services, discipline, and
literature. He consults the original
authorities, and, putting aside wearisome
controversies on points of detail,
confines himself to facts well
ascertained.</p>

<p>It was during his residence at
Pontop and Crook Hall, and before
removing to Ushaw&mdash;in a neighborhood
where Weremouth and Jarrow
recalled the memory of Bede, and
where Tynemouth, Hexham, Lindisfarne,
and many other spots spoke
eloquently of the past&mdash;that Lingard
used, in his spare moments, to compile
the several papers on the religion,
laws, and literature of the Anglo-Saxons,
of which his work is composed.
Seated by the evening fireside,
he would read them to his companions,
and their interest in his theme,
and surprise at the extent of his
learning, increased with every reading.
When, at length, the series
reached its close, his friends earnestly
requested him to publish them as
a connected history; and thus the
foundation of his future reputation
and usefulness was laid. If amateur
authors would more frequently try
their strength in this way, without
rushing unadvisedly into print, they
would be spared much disappointment
and expense, and the standard
of current literature would be raised.</p>

<p>The publication of <cite>The Anglo-Saxon
Church</cite> naturally led to Lingard's
being solicited to extend his
history to a later period. Why
should not he, who was evidently
so competent, trace the fortunes of
the church through the Norman,
Plantagenet, Lancastrian, and Yorkist
periods? Nay, what reason was
there why he should not give the
world a Catholic version of the history
of the Reformation, so commonly
and flagrantly misrepresented? How
many old Catholic families would be
delighted to peruse a faithful record
of events in which their ancestors
were concerned! Might not he
throw a halo round many illustrious
Catholic names, and tear up by the
roots many Protestant historic falsehoods?
Had not several of the
Stuart kings shown a bias, and more
than a bias, towards the ancient
religion? And who could exhibit
the different phases in the career and
character of those kings so well as
he? If Queen Mary had been unduly
reviled, and Queen Elizabeth extravagantly
praised, on whom could
the task of rectifying these mistakes
be devolved so safely as on Lingard?
Such questions stirred his
activity and laudable ambition; for
he was not unconscious of his ability
to write the history of his country.
At first, indeed, he modestly shrank
from so serious an undertaking, and
contemplated only an abridgment
for the use of schools; but a secluded
mission like that of Hornby, to
which he had retired, is highly favorable
to the composition of important
works. The <cite>Abridgment</cite>
was revised when he had buried
Henry VII., and, after being rewritten,
was thrown aside. The scaffolding
was thrown down, but the house
stood.</p>

<p>When Lingard visited Rome in
1817, he was, in the first instance,
discouraged by the reception he met
with. It was intimated to him by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
a member of the Sacred College that
Dr. Milner had already sufficiently
exposed and refuted the calumnies
contained in Hume, and that further
researches for the purposes of English
history were unnecessary or
of slight importance. Every writer
of eminence has met with similar
rebuffs. Lingard was mortified, but
not deterred from the object he had
in view. Before he left Rome, the
archives of the Vatican had been
opened to him without reserve, his
admission to the libraries was facilitated,
and transcripts of such unpublished
documents as he might require
were promised him. Unfortunately,
the privilege of consulting the
Vatican treasures was of little use,
seeing that the French Revolution
had thrown the codices into much
confusion.</p>

<p>In the early part of 1819 the three
volumes of the <cite>History of England</cite>, extending
to the death of Henry VII.,
were published, having been purchased
by Mawman, the publisher,
for a thousand guineas; and other
volumes followed at irregular intervals,
till, in 1830, the whole history
down to the Revolution of 1688
had appeared. For the first and
second editions the author received
altogether £4,133&mdash;an extraordinary
amount, considering the unpopularity
of Catholics at the time of its appearance,
and the small number of
English Catholic readers. But its
fame extended beyond the English
shores; translations in French and
German were published; and an
Italian translation was printed, by
the Pope's desire, at the press of the
Propaganda. His Holiness subscribed
for 200 copies of this translation;
and Cardinal Cristaldi, the <cite>Trésorière
Générale</cite>, for a yet larger number.
It was reproduced in America, and
in Paris by Galignani, and read
at Rome with enthusiastic delight.
Pius VII., in August, 1821, conferred
on the author the triple academical
laurel, creating him at the same time
doctor of divinity and of canon
and civil law. Leo XII. invited him
to take up his residence in Rome;
but from this Lingard excused himself
by saying that it was necessary
he should examine original papers
which could be found in England
only. On his departure, the same
pontiff presented him with the gold
medal which is usually reserved
for cardinals and princes, and he is
said to have designed for him the
dignity of the cardinalate.</p>

<p>As time went on, Lingard's knowledge
of English history widened
and deepened. He availed himself
eagerly of the new sources of information
which this century has opened
so abundantly, and, by the constant
revision of his work, he rendered it
increasingly valuable. It would be
difficult to overstate its merits, one
of the highest of which is its impartiality
and fearless statement of
what the writer knew to be true. He
avoided all appearance of controversy,
and often refuted Hume without appearing
to do so. His great aim was
to write a history which Protestants
would read, and in this he succeeded.
In 1825, the President of the
English College at Rome, Dr. Gradwell,
wrote to him, saying: "Your
<cite>History</cite> is much spoken of here as
one of the great causes which have
wrought such a change in public
sentiment in England on Catholic
matters." Dr. Wiseman, writing to
Lingard in July, 1835, said: "All
the professors at Munich desired me,
again and again, to assure you of the
high esteem they entertain for you, and
the high position your work is allowed,
through all Germany, among historical
productions. Prof. Phillips, formerly
professor of history at Baden,
now at Munich, requested me to in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>form
you that he owes his conversion
(which made immense sensation, on
account of his well-known talents)
chiefly to your <cite>History</cite>, which he undertook
to review." A few weeks
only before Cardinal Wiseman's
death, he thus expressed his sense of
Dr. Lingard's merits, both as an author
and a man: "Be assured of my
affectionate gratitude to you for much
kindness in my early youth, and still
more for the great, important, and
noble services which you have rendered
to religion through life, and
which have so much contributed to
overthrow error, and give a solid historical
basis to all subsequent controversy
with Protestantism."</p>

<p>In mentioning those writers who
have helped to construct an English
Catholic literature, it would be impossible
to omit the name of Thomas
Moore. Though an Irishman by
birth, the English, among whom he
chiefly resided, are accustomed to
reckon him among their own; and
though, unhappily, he ceased, at an
early period of life, to observe regularly
the duties of his religion, he
never ceased altogether to frequent
the services of the Catholic Church;
and in his writings he maintained to
the last the truth of Catholicism, and
the immense superiority of its system
over all modern forms and sections of
Christianity. His <cite>Travels of an Irish
Gentleman in search of a Religion</cite> is
no less forcible in argument than
humorous in style; and numberless
passages in his diaries and poems
prove that Catholicism retained its
hold over his heart as well as his understanding,
though it did not always
influence duly his practice as a member
of the church. Probably his
passion for society, and his fondness
for the great, were in some measure
the causes of his conforming outwardly
to Protestant observances,
and allowing his children to be educated
in the doctrines and usages of
the Church of England. Certain it
is that his own affections were never
weaned from the faith of his parents;
and one of his most intimate friends,
Lord Russell, who was also his biographer,
assures us that, when in London,
it was his custom to frequent the
Catholic chapel in Wardour Street.</p>

<p>We cannot in this place discuss as
fully as it deserves the question of
Moore's personal Catholicity. Suffice
it to refer to a passage in his <cite>Diary</cite>,
under the date November 2 to 9,
1834, and to the following, dated
April 9, 1833: "In one of my conversations
with Lord John (Russell),
we talked about my forthcoming
book, and I explained to him the
nature of it, adding that I had not
the least doubt in my own mind of
the truth of the case I undertook to
prove in it&mdash;namely, that Popery is in
all respects the old, original Christianity,
and Protestantism a departure
from it." Such was the lesson
which the <cite>Travels of an Irish Gentleman
in search of a Religion</cite> was intended
to teach; nor could anything
less than a deep sympathy for the
faith of the people of Ireland have
inspired Moore with such touching
lamentations over their wrongs and
sufferings. The frame of his mind
was essentially religious; and those
who have been wont to think of
him as a dissolute devotee of fashion
will feel surprised to discover in the
authentic records of his life a fond
and faithful husband, an affectionate
son, a loving parent, and, as far as
his feelings were regarded, a devout
Christian. His <cite>Sacred Songs</cite> were
not efforts of the imagination merely;
they expressed the genuine emotions
of his inmost heart; and how beautifully,
and in numbers how inimitably
melodious! There is a disposition
among some critics to disparage
Moore's poetry, and to treat him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
merely as a love-sick rhymer; but
his fame is proof against such pitiful
assailants; and his poems will awaken
echoes in the human heart when
their artificial and obscure poetizings
shall</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"... bind a book, or line a box,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or serve to curl a maiden's locks."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>There cannot be a doubt that his
writings contributed largely to the
success of the movement in favor of
Catholic emancipation, and that his
<cite>Irish Melodies</cite> in particular conspired
with the speeches and addresses of
O'Connell to kindle in the breasts
of Irishmen and Irishwomen the determination
to set their country free.
The enthusiasm, even to tears, which
they excited on the lake, in the grove,
in the music-hall and the banqueting-room,
when sung to the soft notes of
the piano or harp, burst forth sooner
or later in action, and produced results
by which senates were moved
and populations stirred. The power
which poetry has over men's hearts
and actions is a test of its merits that
rises far above the technicalities of a
pedantic school; and Moore's lyrics
are not found wanting when tried by
this standard. They are truly "magnetic."
They have fired many a
soldier on the field of battle, and
excited many an orator at the hustings;
they have comforted many
a solitary mourner, and smoothed
many a touch of sickness and pain.
We have, of course, no apology to
offer for some of those in which he
celebrates earthly love; though it
must be admitted he has not been
unmindful of that higher, that divine
love, which alone can crown earthly
affections with true happiness. No
one has sung more sweetly than
Moore the truths that God is "the
life and light of all this wondrous
world"; that he dries the mourner's
tear; that "the world is all a fleeting
show"; that there is nothing bright
but the soul may see in it some feature
of Deity, and nothing dark but
God's love may be traced therein.
What hymn-book contains a spiritual
lesson more true and beautiful
than this?</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As morning, when her early breeze<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Breaks up the surface of the seas,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">For truth divine to enter there!"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But it is in Moore's national poems
that we must look for the principal
gauge of his influence on public opinion.
Their effect in England was
no less magical than in Ireland.
Wherever they were sung or read,
they turned enemies into advocates;
and mammas little dreamed that political
treatises were entering their
homes in the shape of rolls of music.
By adapting modern words to ancient
airs, they appealed to listeners
by the twofold charm of antiquity and
novelty. They surpassed the plaintive
sweetness of Carolan, being addressed
to more refined audiences
than had ever gathered round Erin's
minstrels of old. During one-and-twenty
years, from 1807 to 1828, the
<cite>Irish Melodies</cite> transmitted the "light
of song" "through the variegating
prism of harmony"; and the cruel
acts against minstrels in the reigns
of Henry VIII. and Elizabeth were
atoned for by the rapturous welcome
given in England under the last two
of the Georges to the most tuneful
expressions of patriotism that ever
broke from lip and lyre since the days
of "the sweet Psalmist of Israel."
They laid bare the bleeding heart-strings
of the Irish cotter, exile, and
emigrant; they pleaded for the redress
of his wrongs, centuries old;
they invoked a Nemesis on his oppressor;
they enlisted on his side
the suffrages of the noble, the tender<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>-hearted,
and the brave. They coupled
Ireland with Poland in the minds
of all lovers of political justice; and
they even suggested analogies between
the Irish and the persecuted
and outcast people of Israel. That
they promoted indirectly, and still
promote, the cause of Catholicism is
certain; for the sequences of mental
associations are governed by rules as
fixed as those which attend the sequences
of natural products. Under
the symbol of lovers, which all can
understand, they frequently set forth
the relation between the Irishman
and his country, including his religion.
To the true Irishman, indeed,
of that period, the ideas of his native
land and his father's faith were inseparable,
and he would have thought
that which was disloyal to either to
have been treason against both.
Moore's Catholic education&mdash;the
never-forgotten lessons of Catholic
parents, whom he fondly loved&mdash;constituted
a large element in the power
and charm of his ever-varied and incomparable
<cite>Melodies</cite>.</p>

<p>The practical importance of journalism
as a branch of literature cannot
be too highly rated; for, though
in itself it seldom reaches the highest
literary excellence, it brings it down
to the level of ordinary understandings,
and retails to the public what
in the wholesale they would not buy.
In the beginning of 1840, the Catholic
field in England was sufficiently
extended, and its prospects were so
promising that a weekly organ of
greater ability and wider scope than
any which then existed was imperatively
required. No one appeared
better able to conduct such a journal
successfully than Frederic Lucas.
Born of Quaker parents, and educated
at the London University, he had, at
an early age, been distinguished for
his ardent pursuit of literature in
preference to art, science, or mathematics.
Skilful as a debater, and insatiable
in his historical researches,
he was attracted to the subject of religion
by its controversial and historic
side. The works of Bentham, and
the stirring events of the revolutionary
period of 1830, drew him deep
into politics, while the poetry of
Byron, Shelley, and Wordsworth
strewed his pathway with shells and
flowers, and colored every object
around him with rainbow hues.
Called to the bar in 1835, he became
intimately acquainted with Thomas
Carlyle, personally and as an author.
The writings of this eminent historian
and philosopher had for him a special
charm, to which the peculiarity of
their style was no drawback. He
took great interest in the lectures on
<cite>Heroes and Hero Worship</cite> when they
were first delivered; and it was from
his accurate notes that a full report
of Lecture No. 1 was published in
the <cite>Tablet</cite>. Though the tendency of
Carlyle's works is towards anything
but Catholicism, they had, strange to
say, an indirect tendency that way in
Lucas' case. They called up many
sympathies in favor of the middle
ages, and pointed to increase of faith
as the grand remedy for human ills.</p>

<p>There was about this time a great
stirring of the public mind on religious
subjects, and Lucas, reflecting deeply
on the chaotic state of Christendom
and the ever-multiplying forms of
schism, became attracted to views
set forth with great ability by Oxford
divines, tending to revive mediæval
practices and produce a tranquil reliance
on ancient ecclesiastical authority.
But he felt no inclination to
stop at the half-way house. To exchange
Quakerism for Anglicanism
would, he thought, be a loss rather
than a gain; for the doctrines of the
Society of Friends could, at least, be
stated definitely, whereas those of the
Church of England were matter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
ceaseless debate between three parties&mdash;High
Church, Low Church,
and Broad Church. He therefore
broke through every barrier, and ruptured
many ties of friendship, interest,
and old association. His <cite>Reasons
for becoming a Roman Catholic</cite> was
a pamphlet remarkable for the poetic
exuberance of its style, and still more
from the fact of its being addressed
to Friends, and its defending Catholicism
from a Friend's point of view.
A few articles published in the <cite>Dublin
Review</cite> established Lucas' literary
reputation among his co-religionists,
and he was soon invited to edit a new
Catholic weekly journal, which he
named the <cite>Tablet</cite>. The first number
appeared on the 16th of May, 1840,
and during fifteen years Lucas continued
to direct the undertaking, and
to take a leading part in its composition.
Some of the literary and miscellaneous
papers were, in the early
days of the publication, contributed
by non-Catholics; but it was then,
and has ever since been, regarded
as an exponent of Catholicism&mdash;not,
indeed, absolutely authoritative,
but in the highest degree weighty,
and semi-official.</p>

<p>It can scarcely be necessary to
speak of the ability which this journal
displayed in Lucas' hands. One
anecdote will suffice to prove the
intellectual readiness and aptitude of
the editor. An article which appeared
in the <cite>Dublin Review</cite> in 1849, on
the "Campaigns of the Duke of Marlborough,"
at once attracted the notice
of Sir William Napier, the historian
of the Peninsular War. Competent
judge as he was, he supposed the
article to be written by a soldier, and
could not conceive that any other
than a military man could exhibit so
much familiarity with the manœuvres
of armies and the tactics of generals.
When he learned that it was a civilian
who thus described and commented
on the battles of Blenheim, Ramillies,
Oudenarde, and Malplaquet, he
hastened to make his acquaintance,
and offered him every species of encouragement.</p>

<p>But if English Catholics were fortunate
in having a really literary man
at the head of their most popular
journal, they were still more so in
possessing an archbishop who was a
connoisseur in art, skilled in science,
and profound in ancient and modern
lore. There were few subjects with
which Cardinal Wiseman was not
conversant; and when weary of business
and serious study, he would often
refresh his own mind and entertain
his friends by discussing topics
altogether outside the ordinary grave
circle of a prelate's discourse. He
could talk of pancakes and posy-rings,
of "Cymbeline" and "Peter Bell,"
as fluently as of general councils
and the <cite>Acts of the Martyrs</cite>. His
<cite>Essays</cite>, reprinted from the <cite>Dublin
Review</cite>, his <cite>Connection between Science
and Revelation</cite>, his <cite>Fabiola, a Tale of
the Catacombs</cite>, and his <cite>Lives of the
Last Four Popes</cite>, abundantly establish
his literary reputation, and are equally
creditable to his research, observation,
and inventive faculty. The story of
<cite>Fabiola</cite> was composed, as he tells us,
"at all sorts of times and places,
early and late; in scraps and fragments
of time, when the body was
too fatigued or the mind too worn-out
for heavier occupation; in the
roadside inn, in the halt of travel, in
strange houses, in every variety of
situation and circumstance, sometimes
trying ones." In the midst of
his episcopal labors, he found time
for the delivery of numerous lectures
on secular subjects, which attracted
public attention to many curious
points in literature, art, and science.
In the present age, when every field
of knowledge and experiment is
crowded with eager students, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
when a disposition is seen everywhere
to subordinate all discoveries and
researches to high, if not always
correct, views of religion, it seems to
be of the utmost importance that
Catholics in general should, as far as
they are able, copy the example of
Cardinal Wiseman in cultivating the
happy and hallowed alliance of truth
divinely revealed and truth humanly
ascertained, feeling sure that, however
the two may seem here and there to
clash one with another, the discrepancy
between them is only apparent,
and will vanish on closer investigation.</p>

<p>Dr. Newman has adopted a perfectly
unique mode of enriching the
Catholic literature of his country.
He is now, in his advanced age,
republishing all his works from the
commencement of his author-life.
Many of these appeared while he
was still a clergyman of the Church
of England; but to these he appends
qualifying or explanatory notes, thus
laying before his readers both his
first and second thoughts. This often
gives him an opportunity of
rebutting his former errors, and, by
a brush of arms, laying low many
a favorite Anglican defence. The
series serves, also, to fill up various
parts of his biography which had
been sketched only in the <cite>Apologia
pro Vita Sua</cite>. It is, therefore, welcome
to the reading public in general, to
whom his earlier life has never lost
its interest in consequence of his conversion.
The avidity with which his
works are read by non-Catholics is
no small proof of their merit intellectually
considered. Indeed, to use
the words of one writing in a hostile
spirit in the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite> of Sept.
23, 1872: "The extreme beauty of
his language, the rarity of his utterances,
his delicate yet forcible way
of dealing with opposition when
obliged to do so&mdash;all these things
have invested his image with a kind
of halo, to which, for our parts, we
scarcely remember a parallel."</p>

<p>Nothing could prove more conclusively
the esteem in which he is held
by the English public than the reception
given to his <cite>Apologia</cite>. Though
this publication was polemical, though
Dr. Newman's adversary was a Protestant
clergyman and professor in
the University of Cambridge, the verdict
given by the leading journals
and reviews of the day was emphatically
on the side of the Priest of the
Oratory&mdash;the convert from Anglicanism!
Mr. Kingsley was universally
condemned as having advanced what
he could not substantiate; and the
beautifully naïve account which the
assailed gave of his own life, opinions,
literary and ministerial career, was
welcomed and hailed with praise,
admiration, and delight. The <cite>Spectator</cite>
(than which no review in
England stands higher) styled the
<cite>Apologia</cite>: "An interior view of one
of the greatest minds and greatest
natures ever completely subjected to
the influence of reactionary thought";
and it added: "Mr. Kingsley has
grievously wronged a man utterly
unintelligible to him, but as incapable
of falsehood or of the advocacy of
falsehood as the sincerest Protestant."
The <cite>Union Review</cite>, a High Church
organ, said of the same work: "Since
the <cite>Confessions</cite> of S. Augustine were
given to the world, we doubt if
any autobiography has appeared of
such thrilling interest as the present."
The <cite>Saturday Review</cite> was scarcely
less emphatic. "Few books," it said,
"have been published, in the memory
of this generation, full of so varied an
interest as Dr. Newman's <cite>Apologia</cite>."
To these extracts we must add one
more from a writer in the <cite>Times</cite>:
"So far as one can judge from the
opinions of the press, it is universally
acknowledged that Dr. Newman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
has displayed through his whole life,
and never more so than at the time
he was most bitterly assailed, the
most transparent idea of an honorable
and high-minded gentleman."</p>

<p>It is not so much to the theological
as to the literary character of Dr.
Newman's works that we wish to call
attention. As a writer of sermons, he
has never been surpassed. Old as
the Christian religion is, he never
failed in preaching to present some
portion of it in a new light. The
Scriptures of the Old Testament in
his hands acquire new meaning and
import; and the subtlety of his
thought is only equalled by the limpid
clearness of his style. To those
who remember him only as he appeared
in the pulpit of S. Mary the
Virgin's, Oxford, his image is that of
a seer piercing the depths of nature
and redemption, and enunciating, under
the influence of a divine afflatus,
truths full of awe and tenderness,
but often too vast for the comprehension
of his hearers.</p>

<p>The test of any work of art is this&mdash;that
it will bear the closest inspection.
The fine gold of Dr. Newman's sermon-writing
becomes more evident
when his discourses are molten down
in the crucible of severe criticism.
They have nothing to fear from dissection;
rather they court the anatomist's
knife. Their beauty does not
lie on the surface merely, though that
surface is passing fair; they have
that interior charm and sweetness,
that plaintive and mysterious tenderness,
which belongs to the notes of a
Stradivarius violin when played by a
master-hand. They suggest more
than they say; they are replete with
thoughts that often lie too deep for
tears, and make us feel that we are
greater than we know. They win upon
our hearts like a living voice, and make
us love the writer, whom we have
perhaps never seen. "Eloquent"
would be a poor and vulgar adjective
to apply to them. They are more
than eloquent; they are poetry, religion,
and philosophy combined in
prose, which is prose only because it
is not in rhythm.</p>

<p>Largely as Dr. Newman is gifted
with the imaginative faculty, he has
not acquired, nor, indeed, deserved to
acquire, the same honors as a poet
as by his prose writings. His verses
entitled "Lead, kindly Light," are
faultlessly beautiful, and some parts
of <cite>Gerontius</cite> are very fine; but in
his poetry in general there is a want
of color and detail. His mind has
not been turned sufficiently to the
minuter qualities and phases of natural
objects to make a consummate
poet. He is too abstract, chill, and
classical for the luxurious requirements
of modern verse. But when,
in his prose, he launches into matter
highly poetical in its nature, as in
<cite>Callista</cite>, when he describes the ravages
of the locusts, or in his <cite>Sermons</cite>,
when he dwells on the assumption
of Our Lady's body into heaven, his
language is equally copious and
brilliant, reaching the highest form
of speech without any sacrifice of
simplicity, point, or color. Whatever
Dr. Newman writes, be it sermon,
history, or fiction, it has the air of an
essay. It is a charming disquisition&mdash;the
outpouring of the thoughts of a
great and original mind on some
point which deeply interests him, and
the connection of which with other
matters of high import he sees more
clearly than other men. But he is
not discursive; he does not straggle
about from one subject to another,
but keeps closely to that which is in
hand. Hence, to cursory readers he
often seems to be forgetting some
truths, because he dwells so fully and
forcibly on others. It is their minds
which are at fault, not his. All parts
of a large system of Christian philo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>sophy
are present to his view at all
times; and for this very reason he
can afford to spend himself on each
in detail and labor upward from the
particular to the universal. In this
respect he resembles Plato, while in
others he has been compared, not
unjustly, to S. Augustine:</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>When Thomas Moore was visiting
Sir Walter Scott at Abbotsford, nearly
fifty years ago, they both agreed
that much of the poetry then appearing
in periodicals, and passing
comparatively unnoticed, would, not
many years before, have made the
reputation of the writers. If they
were alive now, with how much
stronger emphasis would they make
a similar remark! Magazine poetry
in England now is as superior to that
of 1825 as that of 1825 surpassed
that of 1775. There are not a few
poets at this moment, whose names
are scarcely known, who would, at an
earlier period of English literature,
have been crowned with laurel by
general consent. The great poets of
this century have raised the standard
of poetry, and verse nowadays is what
Scott and Wordsworth, Byron and
Moore, Shelley and Tennyson, have
made it. Mr. Aubrey de Vere, in the
time of Daniel, Carew, Drummond,
and Drayton, would have been a
star of the first magnitude; whereas
he is now, partly on account of his
Catholic principles, observed and
admired by the public far less than
he deserves. Born of a Protestant
family, and educated in the Protestant
religion, he has in ripe years chosen
the better part, and embraced the
faith of the large majority of his
countrymen. He has thrown himself
into the views of Irish Catholics
on political subjects, and has, without
disloyalty to the existing government,
reproduced in modern verse
the passionate sentiments of Irish
chieftains, captives, exiles, emigrants,
and serfs of the soil in days long past.
Residing, however, chiefly in England,
and representing, as he does, the
later colonists of Ireland, we may
venture to class him among English
authors, or, at least, to consider his
poems as a contribution to English
Catholic literature. Occasional obscurity
and faulty rhymes are, in his
case, redeemed by poetry's prime excellence&mdash;originality
of thought and
expression. Lines pregnant with
truth and beauty are constantly recurring,
and the deeply religious
feeling which pervades all has the
great advantage of not being expressed
in hackneyed and conventional
language. The <cite>May Carols</cite> is a perfect
conservatory of lovely images
clustering round the central figure of
immaculate Mary. The 21st carol, on
"The Maryless Nations," is perhaps
better known in the United States
than in England, for it is said that
this prophet is less honored in his
own country than in America; yet it
may fairly be quoted here as a very
favorable specimen of Mr. Aubrey de
Vere's reflective verse:</p>

<p>There is another "May Carol"
which has always struck us as particularly
beautiful, because so highly
figurative. Metaphor and music
make up the soul of poetry. It is an
apostrophe to the south wind, and is
headed by the motto, <i lang="la">Adolescentulæ
amaverunt te nimis</i>, a text from the
<cite>Canticles</cite>, which sufficiently explains
the mysticism of the lines:</p>

<p>There is another poem by Mr. Aubrey

quoted for its ingenuity; nor can we,
in reading it, but be reminded of
what was said of Euripides, and
might, with equal truth, be said of
him: "In all his pieces there is the
sweet human voice, the fluttering human

<p>The Catholic press in England,
which at the commencement of this
century was smitten with barrenness,
now teems with ceaseless productions.
Few of them, however, except those
we have mentioned, are destined to
form part of standard literature.
Even Miss Adelaide Anne Procter's
verses are not as widely appreciated as
they deserve to be, though, during
her lifetime, they obtained for her the
reputation of being one of the most
tuneful moralists that ever sung or
breathed. Mrs. William Pitt Byrne
has earned well of the public by the
lively manner in which she has de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>scribed
so many Catholic countries,
and the diligence with which she has
collected her materials. Her works
on Belgium, France&mdash;Paris in particular&mdash;Spain,
and Hungary have supplied
amusement and instruction to a
large number of subscribers to circulating
libraries, and have thus accomplished
a great part of the purpose
for which they were written. F.
Faber's numerous volumes are too
well known to need much comment
on this occasion. They are intensely
devotional, full of fervid eloquence,
and rich with the coloring of a poetic
mind. Many of his <cite>Hymns</cite> are
popular, and will long remain so, because
they are simple, forcible, and direct.
Lady Georgina Fullerton has
succeeded as a religious novelist, and
has been the first as an English Catholic
to occupy the ground which is
now especially hers. Kenelm Digby's
<cite>Ages of Faith</cite>, <cite>Compitum</cite>, and
other works have a special charm for
those who love choice quotations
and pictures of mediæval piety; Mr.
T. W. Allies has ably and valiantly
defended the Papal supremacy; Mr.
John Wallis has rendered <cite>Heyne's
Songs</cite> in graceful English lyrics; Mr.
Charles Waterton's <cite>Wanderings</cite> are deservedly
prized by naturalists; Mr.
Richard Simpson's <cite>Life of Campion</cite> displays
much historical research; F.
Morris has depicted admirably the sufferings
of Catholic martyrs and confessors
under the Reforming sovereigns;
the <cite>Life of the Marquis of Pombal</cite>, by
the Conde da Carnota (an English
work), though too favorable to the Portuguese
prime minister, is highly valuable
so far as it is documentary; and
the papers read before the <cite>Academia
of the Catholic Religion</cite>, and published
in two volumes, supply in themselves
a test of the literary proficiency
of many distinguished members
of the church in England at the present
time. The following works also
deserve to be mentioned as valuable
additions to the stock of English
Catholic literature: <cite>The Evidence for
the Papacy</cite>, by the Hon. Colin Lindsay;
<cite>The Life of Cardinal Howard</cite>,
by F. Palmer; Buckley's <cite>Life and
Writings of the Rev. Father O'Leary</cite>;
<cite>Christian Schools and Scholars</cite>, by the
author of <cite>The Knights of S. John</cite>;
Dr. Husenbeth's <cite>Life of Bishop Milner</cite>;
Mr. Maguire's <cite>Rome, its Ruler
and its Institutions</cite>; and Dr. Rock's
<cite>Hierurgia</cite>.</p>

<p>Among Catholic poets, we ought
not to forget Mr. Coventry Patmore,
whose playful, pleasing, and thoughtful
octosyllabics&mdash;<cite>The Angel of the
House</cite> and <cite>Faithful for Ever</cite>&mdash;found
many admirers ten or twelve years
ago. There is in these fluent productions
a simplicity which at first sight
strikes one as namby-pamby, but
which, on further consideration, is
seen to be a light veil of serious
thought and genuine emotion. There
are minds which can never appreciate
poetry of the highest order; who
admire it only because they are
taught that they ought to do so,
but cannot love it, even though it be
stamped with the approval of ages.
"None ever loved <em>because he ought</em>" is
true in reference to more subjects
than one; and it is well that second-rate
poetry should be written and
preserved for second-rate appreciations.
Mr. Coventry Patmore's works
fulfil a purpose, and are therefore not
to be despised, though they will
never obtain a large reward.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped and expected
that, as time goes on, Catholic literature
in England will enlarge its
borders without declining in orthodoxy.
Colleges and universities yet
to be founded will encourage learning
in all its branches, and prove to
the world by new examples that
science and religion mutually support
each other. The more firmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
the children of the church are rooted
in the faith, the more strength will
their intellect acquire, and the more
freedom will they be able to indulge
with safety. The literary spirit, animated
and guided by the true religion,
will ever find new fields of useful
speculation and research; and
the rebuke of ignorance, so often
cast on members of the church,
will fall pointless when they are
able to meet non-Catholic historians
and professors on their own ground,
and to rob them frequently of a
crown in the arena of literary combat.</p>

<h3>THE SONG OF ROLAND.</h3>


<p>Among the epic romances of the
middle ages, the first place must be
given to the <cite>Song of Roland</cite>. It
deserves this, not only on account of
its antiquity, but also for the importance
of the hero, and for the <em>triumphant
loss</em>, as Montaigne would have
called it, which it immortalizes. It
is a <i lang="fr">chanson de geste</i>, supposed to
have been composed by Turold or
Théroulde, a troubadour who lived
during the first thirty years of the
XIth century, though the only place
where he is mentioned is the line
with which the Bodleian MS. of the
<cite>Chanson de Roland</cite> terminates.</p>

<p>This poem is a curious example
of the work of popular imagination
upon actual events, and shows, with
remarkable unity and originality, the
power of this species of transformation.</p>

<p>The historical narrative, as related
by Eginhard, son-in-law of Charlemagne,
recounts a grievous and unavenged
disaster&mdash;the complete destruction
of the rear-guard of the
French army, which, after a succession
of victories, was returning from
Spain, and, being surprised by mountaineers
in the gorges of Roncevaux,
left no living witnesses.</p>

<p>But Charlemagne's nephew, Roland,
with all his peers, were among
the slain; it was needful, therefore, to
do honor to his fall, and wash away
the affront against the arms of the
always victorious king. Grief and
admiration combined to accomplish
the task, and we have before us the
legend, which not only perpetuates
the memory of the catastrophe, but
which makes of a death-dirge a hymn
of victory.</p>

<p>The most ancient manuscript of
this poem extant is, without doubt,
the copy in the Bodleian library at
Oxford, which is supposed to be of
the XIIth century. Among other
considerations, the brevity of this
manuscript as compared with others
is a proof of its greater antiquity.
It has not more than four thousand
lines, whereas others have six, and
even eight, thousand. But whether
even this is the primitive version,
without alteration or addition, we
have not the means of knowing.</p>

<p>That which, in the first place, distinguishes
the <cite>Chanson de Roland</cite>
from all other productions of the
mediæval poets anterior to Dante
is its unity of composition; but there
are also other noticeable differences.
The first is in the subject itself, which
is matter of actual history, as we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
seen from the testimony of Eginhard,
who adds, "This reverse poisoned in
the heart of Charles the joy of all the
victories which he had gained in
Spain." It was not a simple skirmish,
but the utter defeat of a valuable
portion of his army&mdash;the only defeat
he had known during the thirty-eight
years of his reign. It is easy to understand
how profound would be the
impression produced by the catastrophe,
which, moreover, was indelibly
deepened, when, half a century later,
the army of one of the sons of Charlemagne,
by a fatal coincidence, was
cut to pieces in this same defile.</p>

<p>The imagination of the people was
not long in merging these two disasters
into one, and in gradually
changing nearly all the accessory
circumstances of the first event.
But it matters little that Charles is
invested with the imperial purple
more than twenty years before the
time; that he is represented as a
white-bearded patriarch, when, actually,
he could not have been more than
thirty-five years of age; that his relationship
to the hero of Roncevaux is
more than doubtful; that the Gascon
mountaineers are transformed into
Saracens; and that, instead of their
chief, Lopez, Duke of Gascony, of
whom the charter of Charles the
Bald speaks as "a wolf in name and
in nature," we have two personages&mdash;King
Marsilion and the traitor Ganelon.
All these transformations, which
are easy to be accounted for, alter in
nothing the basis of the poem, which
is historic truth, while legendary
truth has become its surface and
superstructure.</p>

<p>Another point to be remarked is
that in the <cite>Chanson de Roland</cite> the subject
is national. In other compositions
of the period, the heroes are
Normans, Provençals, Gascons, and
so forth, animated by a patriotism
either as circumscribed as their own
domain, or as wide as the world
which they traversed in search of adventures.
In the poems recounting
their acts and deeds, the name of
France, when it happens to be mentioned,
has merely a geographical
sense, being used as simply designating
the province of which Paris
was the capital&mdash;"La France,"
"La douce France," so often invoked
in the "Lay of Roland"; and
the glow of true and loving patriotism
which warms this poem would alone
distinguish it from every other <i lang="fr">chanson
de geste</i> that has been written.</p>

<p>The figure of Charlemagne next
demands our attention. By a strange
contradiction the Carlovingian poems,
so called because they glorify
the companions of the great emperor
and the deeds performed by
them during his reign, are, with
scarcely any exception, nothing more
than so many satires upon Charlemagne
himself, who is represented
either as a mute and doting imbecile,
or else as a capricious despot;
all the wisdom and courage of the
time being monopolized by the great
barons. The reason is not far to
seek. At the epoch when these poems
were written or "improved,"
royalty in France was struggling to
recover the power of which the
great crown vassals had possessed
themselves at its expense, and the
feudal league defended its acquisitions
<em>not</em> by force of arms alone.
One of the most effectual means at
that period of acting upon the popular
mind was by the influence of
minstrelsy&mdash;that is to say, by poesy
and song; and the troubadours and
<em>jongleurs</em> of the time willingly gave
their services to promote the interests
of their more immediate protectors
and patrons. Under the name
of Charlemagne, it is, in fact, Louis
le Gros or Louis le Jeune whom
they attack, glorifying his epoch, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
depreciating himself, as in "Les
Quatre Fils d'Aymon" and similar
sarcastic romances. Turold is almost
alone in showing us the king
"à la barbe grifaigne," with the
authority and grandeur befitting so
great a monarch, and as one who rises
above his peers more by his dignity
than by his lofty stature. The
knights by whom he is surrounded
are noble and valiant, but he surpasses
them all.</p>

<p>In this homage rendered to the
personal glory of Charlemagne, and
in this sentiment of nationality, which
is a remnant of the old monarchical
unity, of which, in the XIIIth century,
the remembrance had long
been extinguished, but which, towards
the close of the XIth, still existed,
we have two characteristics
which stamp the date of this poem
more unmistakably than could be
done by any peculiarities of orthography
or versification.</p>

<p>It is marked by two other specialties:
the absence of gallantry or amorous
allusions, and the austerity of
the religious sentiment. Scarcely a
line here and there lets us know that
Roland has a lady-love. It is his
own affair, with which the public has
nothing to do. In the whole poem
two women only appear, and these
only in slightly sketched outline.
One is Queen Bramimonde, who
appears for an instant, as she unfastens
her bracelets, and lets their
priceless jewels sparkle temptingly
before the eyes of Ganelon; while
later on we are again given a passing
glimpse of her, first as captive, and
then as Christian. In the other, "la
belle Aude," the affianced bride of
Roland, we have a momentary vision
of beauty and faithful devotion even
to death. She appears but to die of
love and grief too deep for words.
A few centuries later, could any
French poet have been able to resign
so excellent an opportunity for pouring
forth a flood of sentimental verses?
Even the poets of the XIIIth and
XIVth centuries have lengthened
out this tempting subject in endless
variations.</p>

<p>As we pass on to the last consideration,
we meet with other contrasts
between the forefathers and their
posterity. Religion, in the time of
Wace and of Chrestien of Troyes, was
still powerful and honored. Their
heroes, even the most worldly and
pugnacious, are exact in saying their
prayers, kneeling devoutly, and confiding
their souls to the care of the
Blessed Virgin; still, in times of great
solemnity or extremity, in the midst
of danger, or face to face with death,
we do not find the calm and serene
fervor, the submission as well as
faith, which fill the heart of Roland
and his companions.</p>

<p>With regard to another point: if
the "Lay of Roland," or, rather, if the
popular tradition which gave it birth,
makes Saracens instead of Gascons
appear at Roncevaux, it is not pure
fiction. After the death of Charlemagne,
the Saracens had so often
quitted their province of Castile to
make inroads upon Aquitaine, and
Western Europe had them in such
terror, that the fear of present misfortune
had soon effaced the remembrance
of the old combats of Christian
against Christian on the Spanish
frontier. A fixed belief had grown
that every enemy ambushed in the
Pyrenees could not at any period
have been other than an army of mis-believers;
and to this may be added
the idea, which was germinating, that
a day would come when, in defence
of Europe and of the faith, it would
be necessary to destroy the vulture in
its nest by carrying the sword into
the country of Mahomet. It was
not only that the slaughter of Roncevaux
cried out for vengeance; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
Holy War was in the spirit of the
times, and naturally passed into the
poems. These, without preaching a
crusade, prepared the way a century
beforehand, and the idea, dimly shadowed,
it is true, but actually present,
is expressed in the last five or six lines
of the poem, which is, moreover, especially
noticeable as being one which
immortalizes defeat and death. It is
the glorification of courage, in misfortune
and in success, vain as to this
world, but of eternal value for the
next, where the glory of the warrior
pales before the glory of the martyr.</p>

<p>And this thought leads us to our
last consideration, namely, the meaning
of the vowels A O I, with which
every stanza terminates. From the
moment that Roland had died fighting
against the Mussulmans, he became
a saint, whose name must forthwith
be inscribed in the popular
martyrology. It was, therefore, only
fitting to consecrate to him a poem
after the model of the hymns of the
church, so many of which, as well as
the Latin poem on S. Mildred, are
terminated by the vowels e u o u a e&mdash;the
modulation of <i lang="la">sæculorum amen</i>.
This is the opinion of the learned
Abbé Henry, although neither he nor
any of the other writers whom we
have consulted mention their suppositions
as to the exact meaning of the
vowels A O I.</p>

<p>The <cite>Song of Roland</cite> is mentioned
in numberless romances, was
imitated in almost every language of
Western Europe, and appears to have
been made use of as a war-song by
the French armies before it had developed
itself to the proportions in
which it has reached us. There is
no reasonable doubt that it was parts
of this poem that were sung by Taillefer
on the advance of the Normans
at the Battle of Hastings, and not the
"Song of Rollo," their first duke, as
several modern authors have supposed.
We quote the words of Robert
Wace:</p>

<h4>ABRIDGED TRANSLATION OF THE
SONG OF ROLAND.</h4>

<p>Charles the king, our great emperor,
has been for seven full years
in Spain, where he has conquered
the mountainous land even to the
sea. Not a castle which has held
out before him, not a town which he
has not forced to open its gates;
Saragossa on the height of its mountain
alone excepted. King Marsilion
holds it, who loves not God, serves
Mahomet, and invokes Apollo(!)
Nor can he hinder that evil shall befal
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span></p>

<p>King Marsilion is reclining in his
orchard, on a marble terrace, in the
shade of the trees, and surrounded
by more than twenty thousand men.
He takes counsel of his dukes and of
his counts how to escape death or an
affront; his army not being strong
enough to give battle. He asks,
What shall be done?</p>

<p>No one answers. One only, the
subtle Blancandrin, then ventures to
speak. "Feign submission," he
says; "send chariots, laden with
gold, to this proud emperor. Promise
that, if he will return to France,
you will there join him in his chapel
at Aix on the great feast of S. Michael;
that there you will become his
vassal, and receive his Christian law.
Does he demand hostages, we will
give them. We will send our sons.
At the risk of his life I will send mine.
When the French shall have returned
to their homes far away, the day will
arrive, the term will pass by; Charles
will have no word from us, no news
of us. Should the cruel one cut off
the heads of our hostages, better is it
that they should lose their heads
than we our fair Spain."</p>

<p>And the pagans answered, He is
in the right.</p>

<p>King Marsilion has broken up his
council. He commands that six
beautiful white mules be brought,
with saddles of silver and bridles of
gold. To Blancandrin and nine
others who are faithful to him he
says: "Present yourselves before
Charles, carrying olive branches in
your hands in token of peace and
submission. If by your skill you
compass my deliverance from him,
what gold, what silver, what lands
will I not bestow upon you!"</p>

<p>The messengers mount their mules,
and set forth upon their journey.</p>

<p>The scene changes. We are at
Cordova. There it is that Charles
holds his court. He also is in an
orchard. At his side are Roland,
Oliver, Geoffrey of Anjou, and many
others, sons of sweet France; fifteen
thousand are there. Seated upon
silken stuffs, they pass their time in
playing; the oldest and wisest exercise
themselves in the game of chess,
the young knights in fencing.</p>

<p>The emperor is seated in a chair
of gold, in the shade of a pine-tree
and an eglantine. His beard has the
brightness of snow, his figure is tall
and nobly formed, and his countenance
majestic. Any man seeking
him has no need to be told which
is he.</p>

<p>The pagan messengers, alighting
from their mules, humbly salute the
emperor. Blancandrin then addresses
him, showing the rich treasures
which his master sends him, and saying:
"Are you not weary of remaining
in this land? Should you return
to France, the king, our lord, promises
to follow you thither." Thereupon
the emperor raises his hands towards
God; then, bending down his head,
he begins to reflect. This was his
wont, never hasting to speak. Presently
raising himself, he says to the
messengers, "You have spoken well;
but your king is our great enemy.
What shall be a pledge to me for
the fulfilment of your words?"</p>

<p>"Hostages," replies the Saracen.
"You shall have ten, fifteen, or even
twenty, and among them my own
son. What more noble hostage
could be given? When you shall
have returned to your royal palace,
on the great feast of S. Michael
my master will follow you thither.
There, in those baths which God has
made for you, he desires to become a
Christian."</p>

<p>And Charles made answer, "He
may, then, yet be saved!"</p>

<p>The day was bright, the sun shining
in full splendor. Charles caused
a large tent to be prepared in the or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>chard
for the ten messengers. There
they passed the night.</p>

<p>The emperor rises betimes. He
hears Mass and Matins, and thence
going forth, under the shadow of a
tall pine-tree prepares to take counsel
with his barons; for without them he
will do nothing.</p>

<p>Soon they are all before him: the
duke Oger, the archbishop Turpin,
Roland, the brave Oliver, and Ganelon,
the one who would betray them
all.</p>

<p>The council opens. Charles repeats
to his barons the words of
Blancandrin. "Will Marsilion come
to Aix," he asks. "Will he there
make himself a Christian? Will he
be my vassal? I know not what to
deem of his words."</p>

<p>And the French reply, Beware of
him.</p>

<p>Roland rises, saying: "Trust not
Marsilion. Seven years have we
been in Spain, and during all that
time naught have you had from him
but treachery. Fifteen thousand of
his pagans have already been to you,
bringing olive branches and the same
words as to-day. Your counsellors
advised you to allow a truce. What
did Marsilion? Did he not behead
two of your counts, Basan and his
brother Basil? Continue the war.
Continue it as you have begun it:
lead your army to Saragossa, besiege
the city, and avenge those whom the
felon has caused to perish."</p>

<p>While listening to him, the emperor's
countenance darkens. He
strokes his beard, and answers nothing.
All the French keep silence.
Ganelon alone rises, and, advancing
to the emperor with a haughty air,
thus addresses him: "Heed not
the headstrong! Heed not me nor
any other, but your own advantage.
When Marsilion declares to you with
joined hands that he desires to be
your liege-man, to hold Spain from
your hand, to receive your sacred
law, are there those who dare to
counsel you to reject his offers?
Such have scant regard to the sort of
death they are to die. It is a counsel
of pride which ought not to prevail.
Let us leave fools to themselves,
and hold to the wise."</p>

<p>After Ganelon rises the duke Naymes.
In the whole court there is no
braver warrior. He says to Charles:
"You have heard Count Ganelon.
Weigh well his words. Marsilion is
conquered; you have razed his
castles, overthrown his ramparts; his
towns are in ashes, his soldiers scattered
abroad. When he gives himself
up to your mercy, offering you
hostages, wholly to overwhelm him
would be a sin. There ought to be
an end to this terrible war."</p>

<p>And the French said, The duke
has well spoken.</p>

<p>"Lords barons," resumes Charlemagne,
"whom, then, shall we send
to Saragossa to King Marsilion?"</p>

<p>"By your favor, I will go," answers
Naymes. "Give me, therefore, the
gauntlet and the staff."</p>

<p>"No," says the emperor. "No,
by my beard! A sage like you go
so far away? You will in nowise go.
Sit down again." ... "Well, my
lords barons, whom, then, shall we
send?"</p>

<p>"Send me," says Roland.</p>

<p>"You!" cries Oliver. "Your courage
is too fiery. You would not
fail to get yourself into some difficulty.
If the king permits it, I can very
well go."</p>

<p>"Neither you nor he," answers
the emperor; "both of you hold
your peace. In that place not one
of my twelve peers shall set his
foot!"</p>

<p>At these words, every one keeps
silence. However, Turpin rises from
his seat&mdash;Turpin, Archbishop of
Rheims. He, in turn, asks for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
glove and staff; but Charles commands
him to sit down, and not say
another word. Then addressing
himself once more to his barons, he
says, "Free knights, will you not,
then, tell me who shall carry my
message to Marsilion?"</p>

<p>And Roland answers: "Let it be
my father-in-law, Ganelon." And the
French agreed, saying: "He is the
man you want; for a more skilful
one you could not find."</p>

<p>Ganelon at these words falls into
a horrible anguish. He lets slip
from his shoulders his great mantle
of marten; his figure is imposing,
and shows well under his coat of
silk. His eye sparkles with anger.
"Fool!" he says to Roland, "whence
this madness? If God permits me
to return, the gratitude I owe thee
shall end but with thy life!"</p>

<p>"I heed not your threatenings," answers
Roland. "Pride takes away
your reason. A wise messenger is
needed. If the emperor gives me
leave, I set out in your stead."</p>

<p>"Nay," replies Ganelon, "I go.
Charles commands me, and I must
obey him; but I would fain delay my
departure for a little season, were it
but to calm my anger."</p>

<p>Whereupon Roland began to
laugh. Ganelon perceived it, and
his fury was redoubled, insomuch
that he was well-nigh out of his
senses. He darted words of wrath
at his son-in-law, and then, turning
towards the emperor, said: "Behold
me ready to do your bidding. I see
well that I must go to Saragossa; and
he who goes thither returns not.
Sire, forget not that I am the husband
of your sister. Of her I have a son,
the most beautiful that could be seen.
Baldwin will one day be brave. I
leave to him my fiefs and my domains.
Watch over him, for never
shall I see him more!"</p>

<p>And Charles made answer: "You
have too tender a heart. When I
command it, you must go. Draw
near, Ganelon; receive the staff and
gauntlet. You have heard that our
Franks have chosen you."</p>

<p>"No, sire, but it is Roland's work;
therefore, I hate him&mdash;him and his
dear Oliver, and the twelve peers
likewise, who love him so well! I
defy them all before your eyes!"</p>

<p>The emperor silences him, and
commands him to depart. Ganelon
approaches to take the gauntlet from
the hand of Charlemagne, but it falls
to the ground. Heavens! cry the
French; what may this forebode?</p>

<p>"My lords," says Ganelon, "you
will know by the tidings." He then
turns to the emperor for his dismissal,
saying, "Since I must go, wherefore
delay?" Charles with his right
hand makes him a sign of pardon,
and places in his hands a letter and
the staff.</p>

<p>Ganelon, retiring, equips himself in
preparation to depart, fastening on
his heels his beautiful gold spurs;
and with his good sword Murgleis at
his side, he mounts his horse Tachebrun,
while his uncle Guinemer
holds his stirrup. The knights of
his house entreat him with tears to
let them accompany him. "God
forbid!" he answers. "Better that I
alone should perish than cause the
death of so many brave knights. Go
home to sweet France. Salute on my
behalf my wife, and Pinabel, my
friend and comrade; likewise, Baldwin,
my son. Aid him, serve him,
and hold him for your lord." Having
said thus, he departed on his
way.</p>

<p>He had not ridden far before he
came up with the Saracen messengers;
Blancandrin, in order to wait
for him, having slackened his pace.
Then began between them cautious
words. It is Blancandrin who speaks
first: "What a marvellous man is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
this Charles! He has conquered
Apulia, Calabria, passed the sea,
and acquired at St. Peter's the tribute
of the English; but what comes he
to seek in our land of Spain?"</p>

<p>And Ganelon makes answer:
"Thus his courage wills it. Never
will any man hold out before him!"</p>

<p>"The French," replies the other,
"are an exceedingly brave people;
but these dukes and counts who give
council to overturn and desolate
everything do great wrong to their
lord."</p>

<p>"Of such I know but one," says
Ganelon; "it is Roland, and he shall
repent him yet." Thereupon he relates
that on a certain day, before
Carcassone, the emperor being seated
in a shady meadow, his nephew
came to him, clad in his cuirass, and
holding in his hand a rosy apple,
which he presented to his uncle, saying:
"Behold, fair sire, of all the
kings in the world I offer you the
crowns!" "This mad pride will end
in his ruin, seeing that every day he
exposes himself to death. Welcome
will be the stroke that shall slay him!
What peace would then be ours!"</p>

<p>"But," said Blancandrin, "this
Roland, who is so cruel&mdash;this Roland,
who would have every king at his
mercy, and take possession of their
dominions&mdash;by whose aid will he accomplish
his design?"</p>

<p>"By the aid of the French," answered
Ganelon. "They so greatly love
him that never will they suffer any fault
to be laid at his door. All of them, even
to the emperor, march but at his will.
He is a man to conquer the world from
hence to the far East."</p>

<p>By dint of talking as they rode
along, they made a compact to work
the death of Roland. By dint of
riding, they arrived at Saragossa,
and under a yew-tree they got down.</p>

<p>King Marsilion is in the midst of
his Saracens. They keep a gloomy
silence, anxious to learn what news
the messengers may bring.</p>

<p>"You are saved!" exclaims Blancandrin,
advancing to the feet of
Marsilion, and holding Ganelon by
the hand&mdash;"saved by Mahomet and
Apollo, whose holy laws we observe.
Charles has answered nothing; but
he sends this noble baron, by whose
mouth you shall learn whether you
will have peace or war."</p>

<p>"Let him speak," said the king.</p>

<p>Ganelon, after considering a moment,
thus begins: "May you be
saved by the God whom we are all
bound to adore! The will of the
puissant Charlemagne is this: you
shall receive the Christian law; the
half of Spain will be given you in
fief. If you refuse to accept these
terms, you shall be taken and bound,
led to Aix, and condemned to a
shameful death."</p>

<p>At this discourse the king grows
pale, and trembles with fury. His
golden javelin quivers in his hand;
he is about to cast it at Ganelon, but
is held back. Ganelon grasps his
sword, drawing it two fingers' length
out of the scabbard, and saying,
"My beautiful sword! while you
gleam at my side, none shall tell our
emperor that I fell alone in this
strange land; with the blood of the
best you shall first pay for me."</p>

<p>The Saracens cry out: Let us hinder
the combat. At their entreaties,
Marsilion, calming himself, resumed
his seat. "What evil possesses you?"
said his uncle, the caliph, "that you
would strike this Frenchman when
you ought to hear him?" And
Ganelon, meanwhile, composed his
countenance, but kept his right hand
still on the hilt of his sword. The
beholders said to themselves, "Truly,
he is a noble baron!"</p>

<p>Gradually he draws nearer to the
king, and resumes his discourse:
"You are in the wrong to be angry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
Our king bestows upon you the half
of Spain; the other half being for
his nephew Roland, an insolent companion
I admit; but if you do not
agree to this, you will be besieged in
Saragossa, taken, bound, judged, and
beheaded. Thus says the emperor
himself in his message to you."
So saying, he places the letter in the
pagan's hands.</p>

<p>Marsilion, in a fresh access of
rage, breaks the seal, and rapidly
glances over the contents. "Charles
talks to me of his resentment! He
calls to mind this Basan, this Basil,
whose heads flew off at my bidding!
To save my life, I am to send him
my uncle, the caliph; otherwise he
listens to no terms!"</p>

<p>Upon this the king's son exclaims:
"Deliver Ganelon to me, that I may
do justice upon him." Ganelon hears
him, and brandishes his sword, setting
his back against a pine.</p>

<p>The scene suddenly changes. The
king has descended into his garden;
he is calm, and walks with his son
and heir, Jurfalen, in the midst of his
vassals. He sends for Ganelon, who
is brought to him by Blancandrin.</p>

<p>"Fair Sire Ganelon," says the king,
"it may be that I received you somewhat
hastily, and made as if I would
have stricken you just now. To make
amends for this mistake, I present
you with these sable furs. Their
value is more than five hundred
pounds of gold. Before to-morrow,
still more costly ones shall also be
yours."</p>

<p>"Sire, it is impossible that I should
refuse, and may it please Heaven to
recompense you!"</p>

<p>Marsilion continues: "Hold it for
certain, Sir Count, that it is my desire
to be your friend. I would speak
with you of Charlemagne. He is
very old, it appears to me. I give
him at least two hundred years; how
worn out, therefore, he needs must
be! He has spent his strength in so
many lands, when will he be weary
of warfare?"</p>

<p>"Never," said Ganelon, "so long
as his nephew lives. Roland has not
his equal in bravery from hence to
the far East. He is a most valiant
man, and so, likewise, is Oliver, his
companion, and these twelve peers,
so dear to the emperor, who march
at the head of twenty thousand
knights. Can you expect that Charles
should know fear? He is more powerful
than any man here below!"</p>

<p>"Fair sire," replies Marsilion, "I,
also, have my army, than which a
finer cannot be found. I have four
hundred thousand knights wherewith
to give battle to Charles and his
French."</p>

<p>"Trust it not at all," the other
answers; "it will cost you dear, as
well as your men. Lay aside this
rash boldness, and try a little management
instead. Give the emperor
riches so great that our French
will be dazzled by them, and give him
twenty hostages. He will then return
into the sweet land of France, leaving
the rear-guard to follow, in which, I
trust, may be Count Roland and the
valiant Oliver. Only listen to my
counsel, and, believe me, they are
dead."</p>

<p>"Show me, fair sire (and may
Heaven bless you for it!), how I may
slay Roland."</p>

<p>"I am well able to tell you. When
once the emperor shall be in the great
defiles of Cisaire, he will be at a great
distance from his rear-guard. He
will have placed in it his beloved
nephew and Oliver, in whom he so
greatly confides, and with them will
be twenty thousand French. Send,
then, a hundred thousand of your
pagans. I do not in any wise promise
that in a first conflict, murderous
as it will be to those of France, there
will not also be great slaughter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
your men; but a second engagement
will follow, and, no matter in which,
Roland will there remain. You will
have done a deed of exceeding bravery,
and through all the rest of your
life you will have no more war. What
could Charles do without Roland?
Would he not have lost the right arm
of his body? What would become
of his wonderful army? He would
never assemble it more. He would
lose his taste for warfare, and the
great empire would be restored to
peace."</p>

<p>Scarcely has he done speaking,
when Marsilion throws his arms
round his neck, and embraces him;
then offers, without more delay, to
swear to him that he will betray
Roland.</p>

<p>"Be it so, if so it please you,"
answers Ganelon; and upon the relics
of his sword he swears the treason,
and completes his crime.</p>

<p>Marsilion, on his part, causes to be
brought, on an ivory throne, the
book of his law, even the book of
Mahomet, and swears upon it that,
if he can find Roland in the rear-guard,
he will not cease fighting until
he has slain him.</p>

<p>Thereupon Valdabron, a Saracen,
who was formerly the king's guardian,
draws near, and, presenting his
sword, the best in the world, to Ganelon,
says: "I give you this for friendship's
sake; only help us to get rid
of Roland, the baron."</p>

<p>"With all my heart." And they
embrace.</p>

<p>Another, Climorin, brings him his
helmet: "I never saw its like. Take
it, to aid us against Roland, the marquis."</p>

<p>"Most willingly," says Ganelon;
and they also embrace.</p>

<p>Comes at last the queen, Bramimonde.
She says to the count, "Sire,
I love you well, seeing that you are
very dear to my lord and to all his
subjects. Take these bracelets to
your wife. See what gold, what
amethysts and jacinths! Your emperor
has none like these; they are
worth all the treasures of Rome!"</p>

<p>And Ganelon takes the jewels.</p>

<p>Marsilion then summons Mauduit,
his treasurer. "Are the gifts prepared
for Charlemagne?"</p>

<p>"Sire, they are in readiness. Seven
hundred camels laden with gold and
silver, and twenty hostages of the
noblest under heaven."</p>

<p>Then, with his hand on Ganelon's
shoulder, the king says to him:
"You speak fair and fine; but, by
this law which you hold to be the
best, beware of changing purpose towards
us." After this, he promises
that every year he will send him, as
rent, ten mules laden with gold of
Arabia; he gives him the keys of
Saragossa to be carried to Charlemagne.
"But, above all, see that
Roland be in the rear-guard, that we
may surprise him, and give him mortal
combat."</p>

<p>Ganelon replies, "It seems to me
that I have already tarried here too
long." And he mounts his steed and
departs.</p>

<p>At daybreak he reaches the emperor's
quarters. "Sire," says he,
"I bring you the keys of Saragossa,
twenty hostages, and great treasure;
let them be guarded well. It is Marsilion
who sends them. As to the
caliph, marvel not because he does
not come. With my own eyes I saw
him embark on the sea with three
hundred thousand armed men; they
were all weary of the rule of Marsilion,
and were going forth to dwell
in the midst of Christians; but at
four leagues from the coast a furious
tempest overwhelmed them, so that
all were drowned. If the caliph had
been living, I would have brought
him hither. Believe me, sire, before
a month is over, Marsilion will have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
joined you in France; he will receive
the Christian law, and will, as your
vassal, do you homage for the kingdom
of Spain."</p>

<p>"Then God be praised!" said
Charles. "You have well delivered
your message, and it shall profit you
well."</p>

<p>The clarions sound. Charles proclaims
the war at an end. The soldiers
raise the camp; they load the
sumpter horses; the army is in motion,
and on its way towards the
sweet land of France. Nevertheless,
the day closes; the night is dark.
Charlemagne sleeps. In a dream he
sees himself in the great defiles of
Cisaire, with his lance of ash-wood
in his hand. Ganelon seizes hold of
it, shaking it so violently that it flies
in pieces, and the splinters are scattered
in the air.</p>

<h3>LAUS PERENNIS.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></h3>


<p>In the early days of emigration,
before the industry of the Old World
had cut down the forests and muddied
the streams of the New, a young
man sat at noontide by the banks of
a river, an insignificant tributary of
one of those mighty veins that intersect
the continent from Canada to
Florida. His face was a study. He
had the features of the North, with
thick, fair hair and glittering blue eyes,
but his form was slighter, though not
less sinewy, than a Saxon's. Nerves
of steel and a will of iron, generosity
and self-sacrifice, the bravery of an
Indian and the fidelity of a dog&mdash;such
was the tale revealed by his exterior.
His history was simple. He was
the son of a petty farmer in Normandy,
and the foster-brother of the
Baron de Villeneuve. He had been
brought up with the young baron, an
only child, and had been his companion
in his studies as well as his sports.
Every one noticed how refined his
manner was, how noble his bearing;
and yet his village friends never had
reason to complain of any superciliousness
in his deportment towards
them. His mother, feeling that his
superiority would be wasted if he
remained in the groove in which it
seemed his natural destiny to travel,
earnestly wished for a different career
for her favorite, and urged him to enter
the priesthood. This he was too
conscientious to do, feeling no call to
so high an office; and his foster-brother,
in his turn, warmly recommended
the army. Napoleon was then
in the full blaze of his military glory,
and merit might win the metaphorical
spurs of what remained as the
substitute of knighthood, without the
weary delays of official routine. But
the young Norman was insensible to
military glory. There was no fair
damsel, with high cap and ancestral
gold necklace, with spinning-wheel
and a dowry of snowy, homespun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
linen, who had made his heart beat
one second faster than it had in childhood.
If his foster-brother had had
a sister, Robert Maillard would have
been the very man to have loved
her as the knights of old loved the
lady of their dreams, hoping for no
reward save a knot of ribbon and a
pitying glance of faint approval. He
had read of such love, and of fairies,
elves, and witches, of impossible
quests, and of princely donations; but
he felt that the world had changed,
and that these things could never be
again. Strong and brave as he was,
he began life with a secret hopelessness,
knowing that it could never
give him the only things he longed
for. One day, in the midst of his
irresolution as to what work he should
undertake, knowing all work to be
but a <i lang="fr">passe-temps</i> until eternity gave
him the life he coveted, an old sea
captain made his appearance in the
inland village, and electrified the inhabitants
by tales of discovery and
adventure, of which curious proofs
were not wanting in the shape of
carved idols two inches long, mineral
lumps of diminutive size, a
string of wampum, etc., etc., and,
above all, a tame monkey. Robert
listened to the "ancient mariner"
with delight, and, never having seen
the ocean, was suddenly fired by a
wild wish to try his fortune across the
Atlantic. Here was a land as wild as
the Armorican forests in the old tales
of chivalry and legends of monasticism&mdash;a
virgin land of practical freedom,
where new empires might be
carved by the strong and willing
hand, and new mines of knowledge
laid open by the daring intellect. It
was not money that the simple
Norman thought of; it was excitement,
adventure, vague possibilities,
limitless solitudes where hermits and
hunters might live and dream. To
leave Normandy was not exile to
him; to leave all those he loved was
not separation; but do not think he
was heartless. He only lived in a
shadow-world of high, heroic deeds,
and the commonplaces of bucolic
life palled upon him. Instinct bade
him seek something beyond home,
with its petty interests; and never
slow to execute his resolutions, once
they were formed, he bargained with
the old sailor to take him to America
as soon as he recrossed the
ocean. From his father he received
his portion of the scanty inheritance
due to him, and left home as the
prodigal&mdash;so said his weeping mother.
His foster-brother loaded him
with weapons of all kinds, and forced
upon him clothes enough to last a
lifetime in a country where fashion
seldom changed. The first sight of
the ocean was a poem to Robert. He
thought of the galleys of the Crusaders,
as they sailed to the Land of
Promise; of Columbus and his unbelieving
crew on their perilous way
to the land of faith. The glorious
western sunsets awoke a new feeling
in the heart of the adventurer;
he felt that this new "Ultima
Thule" was the land of the poet as
well as of the warrior, and that its majesty,
its serene massiveness, should
be, not the prey of murderous passion,
but the field of a new-born art.
Here was a land whose history, if it
had any, had been blotted out, but
whose immortal beauty was a picture
of the lost Eden&mdash;the true home
of enthusiasm, the virgin parchment
on which to write a new hymn to
the God whom its beauty revealed
almost in a new light. Such were
not the thoughts of most pilgrims to
the New World; if they had been,
people would have said that the
millennium had come.</p>

<p>A Sir Galahad walks the earth but
once in a century, and he has no
compeers. Such was our Robert.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
Why does the world call those men
<em>dreamers</em> whose ideal is the only true
reality, while the life of the world
around them is one long nightmare?</p>

<p>Robert's life, after he had landed
in one of the old sea-coast cities, was
a checkered one. He fled from the
civilization that had stifled him at
home, and which he saw with dismay
roughly reproduced in the communities
of the sea-board; he found
few men whose talk did not jar
upon him; even in the wilderness,
when he came to a log-cabin, he
heard the oaths of low city haunts;
in pastoral settlements, he found
no pastoral innocence; and even
among the friendly Indians they
asked him for spirits, when he would
have spoken of God. Discouraged
and oppressed, he persisted in setting
his face ever westward, till at last he
came to a river, as it seemed to him;
a brook, as it would figure on the
map. He wondered if man had ever
been here before, but smiled to himself
the moment after, knowing that
the red man, the natural possessor of
this princely inheritance, must have
often breathed his prayer to the
Great Spirit by the banks of this
stream. He began to think how useless
the discovery of this new continent
had been, since hitherto the
country had been but a new field for
the white man's sins, a new theatre
for the red man's sorrows. He fell
to thinking of his own far-off ancestors,
roaming morass and forest, like
these sturdy men of bronze, hunting
the deer, and wolf, and bear, like them,
painting their bodies like them, worshipping
bloody gods of war, rearing
children indefatigable on sea and
land&mdash;Scandinavian vikings, fair, and
ruddy, and golden-haired, each man
a chief in stature, and their chiefs
giants. How like the race that still
lorded it over these new realms!
But God's messengers had come
among the Norsemen and daunted
their fierceness, turned their vices
into virtues, and leavened, with a true
and manly, a Christian, civilization,
their hardy, freedom-loving tribes.
Robert knew of the many efforts of
the missionaries among the Indians;
but he knew, also, that it was the evildoing
of the whites that made these
efforts so fruitless. It seemed as if
wherever the human race set foot it
must disturb God's working; and in
sudden disgust at his kind, he vowed
never willingly to enter again any
community of whites. Commerce
was imposition, respectability was
hypocrisy, civilization was cruelty.
"God and my dreams alone remain,"
he cried; "with them I will
walk, and forget that any other building
exists save a church; that there
is any language save prayer; any
human beings save God's worthy
ministers!" Before long, the scent
of the pines and cedars lulled him to
sleep, and, happy in his isolation, he
did not resist the drowsiness that, by
the banks of Norman streamlets, had
often preceded the sweetest moments
of his life.</p>

<p>Soon the pines began to sing in
the strong wind that rocked them,
and the song shaped itself into a
hymn of praise, the words seeming
to echo the form of David's psalm:
"Then shall all the trees of the wood
rejoice before the face of the Lord,
for he cometh.... Praise him, ye
strong winds that fulfil his word; ...
fruitful trees and all cedars."</p>

<p>A voice came out of the rocks, as
if wafted over miles of space, and,
mingling with the song of the pines,
chanted with it, "The treasure-house
of the Lord is in the stones of
the earth; from my bosom flow the
rivers of life-giving waters"; and gently
the sound of tinkling rivulets was
added to the deep song of praise.
It seemed as if all creation, bent upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
doing the task respectively allotted
to each of its parts, had met in conclave
round that obscure Western
river, before the tribunal of a sleeping
mortal. As the shadows grew
darker, the howl of wild beasts was
heard, inexplicably free from the impression
of terror, and strangely fitting
in with the hymn of inanimate
nature. At twilight, a concert of
sweet scents rose from the earth, and
vaporous clouds bore up the prayer
of the fruitful soil, a gentle sound, as
of crystal bells, accompanying the
sacrifice.</p>

<p>"Let your prayer arise before me
as an evening offering," came faintly
from somewhere, and the cry of
myriads of insects rose to greet the
echo. Nothing seemed discordant.
Robert, as it were, heard the world-pulse
beat, and yet was neither appalled
nor astonished; it was the
same voice, whose whispers he knew,
which was speaking to him now, only
it spoke aloud. A moaning sound,
muffled and sad, but grave as the
voice of a teacher, now rose above
the others, and the sleeper knew that
it was that of the ocean:</p>

<p>"The floods have lifted up their
waves with the voices of many
waters. Wonderful are the surges
of the sea; wonderful is the Lord on
high."</p>

<p>Robert thought how true and how
grand was this remorseless servant of
the Almighty will. It does its work
though fleets brave its decrees, and
science peers into its secrets like a
child feebly grasping a two-edged
sword. It obeys God, and its work,
not its voice, is its hymn of praise.
But there is another mighty angel at
work in the heavens, and the trumpet-tones
of his voice ring in the thunder
behind those fast-coming clouds.
Tawny gold and ashen gray, like the
shroud of a fallen world, those clouds
sweep up on the horizon; blades of
light rend them for a moment, and a
livid radiance darts into every crevice
of the forest; the song of the pines
is hushed, and the hymn of the storm
peals out:</p>

<p>"Holy and terrible is thy name....
Fire shall go forth before
thee; ... thy lightnings shine upon the
world; ... for thou art fearfully
magnified!"</p>

<p>A cathedral of ice seems to grow
suddenly out of the pine forest; the
trees are turned to crystal pinnacles,
a world of untrodden snow lies all
around, and within the silence of the
grave. Rose-colored lights play on
the fairy turrets, and turn the ice-pillars
to amber and topaz. More
sublime than any dream of mediæval
enchantment, Robert gazes spellbound
on this crowning marvel, and,
though no articulate words strike his
ear, he is conscious of a life permeating
this realm of silence; of a link
with all other creatures of God, which,
if it spoke, would utter the words that
well spontaneously from his own
heart:</p>

<p>"Thy knowledge is become too
wonderful for me.... Whither shall
I go from thy spirit, and whither shall
I flee from thy face?"</p>

<p>But he is no idle gazer, treating
the world as a show; he is a disciple&mdash;the
Dante of Nature, led by her to
the song-halls of her everlasting concert,
taught by her that all things
have a voice to glorify God and a
mission to execute for him. He may
not stay in the heart of the pole, for
other lessons are all around him, and
the time to learn them is so short&mdash;never
more than a hundred years,
seldom even the third of that time!</p>

<p>The silent world melts from sight,
and the earth seems to recede; the
blue vault of heaven is nearer; a
rushing sound, so awful that his humanity
shudders at it, yet so beautiful
that it deadens the remembrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
of the gentle sounds of the pine-trees,
the crystal flower-bells, the wind, and
even the rolling of the sea, wraps his
being into itself, and holds him in its
mighty spell. Worlds of light flash
by him; of their size he knows naught,
of their qualities less; but their radiance
seems to him the face of God,
"which no man can look upon and
live," while their voice is as that of a
thousand cataracts, each ringing forth
a separate and harmonious note.
"The heavens declare the glory of
God, and the firmament proclaimeth
the works of his hands." Did these
words come out of the sound, or
were they in his own heart, and did
the sound draw them into itself, as
the great ocean would draw back to
its bosom some lonely fragment of
its realm, stranded for a moment by
the last wave that kissed the shore?
Robert could not tell. He scarcely
breathed. He would fain have kept
this vision for ever; he trembled at
the idea of leaving a world after
which his own would look like a hive
of bees, and whose sounds were so
potent that all the sounds of earth,
massed together in one, would barely
seem a whisper in comparison. But
his pilgrimage was not a reward,
not even a trial; it was only an apprenticeship.
Hardly a transition,
save the coming of dawn and a consciousness
of some void, and again
Robert gazed upon familiar scenes
of earth. The sun's forerunner was
flushing the sky, and a wall of living
water stood before him. He watched
intently; no sound came to his
ears. Yet he could see the coronal
of rainbow-tinted foam rising at the
feet of the cataract, and felt as if this
must be the very passage through
which God's people of old had come
dry-shod in the bed of the sea. As
he stood below, breathlessly waiting,
the crown of the waterfall quivered
with a new light, and the sun a crimson
disk, rose slowly into sight. It
seemed as though a bleeding Host
were lifted up to heaven in a chalice
of living jewels. A murmur began
to rise from the clouds of spray; it
grew louder and stronger, and Robert
knew that the voice of the cataract
had reached his ears at last. It was
but a faint echo of that ineffable hymn
of the spheres which rang yet in his
memory, but it was none the less the
sublimest sound he had heard on
earth. Vaguely came to his understanding
a fragment of its meaning:</p>

<p>"Glory to the Power whose breath
has built us into a wall, and whose
breath could hurl us like a flood over
the corn-fields of man."</p>

<p>When Adam disobeyed God in
Eden, this cataract was already thousands
of years old, and for ages had
done God's bidding, calm as eternity,
regular as the course of the planets.
Robert pondered on this sublime
obedience of all strong things to the
law of the Creator, while man, the
weakest of creation, thought it a
shame to follow any will but his own.
But even as he stood thinking, the
earth seemed to tremble beneath him,
and he sank gently into its heaving
bosom. A darkness that bred more
awe than terror encompassed him,
and he felt that he was in the presence
of one of God's most dreaded
ministers. Strange thunders echoed
around him, and a bewildered consciousness
of some mysterious agency
being about him came to his wondering
spirit. Out of the darkness grew
a twilight, in which objects began to
be distinguishable; precious ore glistened
on the face of the rocks; metals
and jewels, heaped in confusion, met
his eye; silver daggers hung within
reach of his hand, like bosses from a
Gothic roof; columns of sparkling
minerals shot up like enchanted trees
by his side; while the plashing of
fountains, the rushing of lava-rivers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
and the dull, perpetual thunder of
ascending flames reached his ear&mdash;a
dusky kingdom, awful in the force it
suggested, but hushed and chained
by a power greater still; a silent
kingdom, the workshop of nature,
where our dreamer feared but to
tread, lest a volcano might be set in
motion on the earth, or an earthquake
overwhelm a score of cities. But not
before hearing the <em>credo</em> of this mighty
world could he leave its regions; it
smote upon him from out the roar
of a furnace, whence a stream of
blinding light ran slowly into a rocky
channel. Molten iron flowed at his
feet, and a voice sang in his ear:</p>

<p>"The earth is the Lord's; the
compass of the world, and all that
dwell therein."</p>

<p>Like hammer-blows came the
dread words; no spirit in living shape
was near, yet a living presence seemed
to glow in each fiery stream or glittering
rock: the guidance of a will
that, millions of ages ago, spoke one
creative word, was enough to lead
the revolutions and point the unerring
road of this grim realm till
time should be no more.</p>

<p>Slowly the walls of darkness dissolved,
and the hard floor of metals
turned to a fine white powder, soft
yet firm; trees grew up, but they
were white as with hoar-frost; and
a marvellous vegetation sprang into
being, the mosses swaying to and fro,
the flowers moving from rock to rock,
the fields of greenest grass swaying as
if with animal life. Jewels hung from
the fairy rocks, but they closed a
strong grip on the finger that touched
them; pearls lay scattered on the
sandy floor, and back and forth fled
swift creatures all lace and film, like
animated cobwebs. Robert felt, by
instinct, that as he had visited the
bowels of the earth, so now he was
roaming the garden of the ocean. In
reverent wonder he paused, looking
upward as if to the sky; and in the
liquid firmament wandering stars of
fitful radiance shone out upon him.
They came now singly, now in strings
like the milky way, or again in fields,
as if a flag had been studded with
glow-worms. As he could not tell
why in the heart of volcanic fires he
had been neither stifled nor consumed,
so now he knew not why he was
not drowned; but with the water veiling
everything around, dripping in
the coral caves, beating against the
rocks, stirring the living petals of
millions of sea-flowers, he stood upright,
waiting for the voice that must
swell the everlasting song. It rose
at first, as though muffled by the
water, grew stronger and clearer, till,
in a tone of triumph, it gave forth its
glad pæan:</p>

<p>"Bless the Lord, all ye seas and
floods; ... all that move in the
waters; ... ye dragons of the
deep."</p>

<p>"Is man, then, the only rebel in
creation," Robert thought sadly, "the
only ungrateful one, who thinks it a
loss of time to sing the praises of
God?" And an answer seemed to
knock at his heart, saying:</p>

<p>"Work is prayer, work is song."</p>

<p>Again the sea-walls broke, the jewel-flowers
disappeared, and a change
came over the dreamer. Snowy mountains;
fleecy peaks, purple-shadowed
where the sunset light caught
their sides; level horizons of gold,
suggesting far lands of miraculous
radiance; banks of crimson by dun
oceans, seeming the grave of a thousand
worlds; a solitude oppressive
and sublime; a silence which not
even the riving asunder of the gray
mountain or dissolving of the tawny
shore into the ocean of blue can
break&mdash;such was the new scene on
which Robert gazed. Entranced
with its beauty, he told himself that
this was lovelier than even the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>ice-cathedral
amid the soundless world
of snow; and here would he fain
build him a home, and wander out
his pilgrimage; for "this is the
threshold of heaven." Now the sun
came from behind the translucent
masses, and left streaks of opal and
amethyst where his footprints had
pressed the fleecy snow; and the
dreamer started as the device of this
world of amazing beauty and absolute
obedience flashed into his eyes
from out the great, golden heart of
the sun. Here there was no voice,
as elsewhere; but the words were
burned into Robert's mind as he gazed
at the mighty orb:</p>

<p>"He has set his tabernacle in the
sun; hereafter ye shall see the Son
of man sitting at the right hand of
the power of God, and coming in the
clouds of heaven."</p>

<p>No sooner had the dreamer gathered
this new verse of the world-song
into his memory, than the mountains
and plains, the valleys and the sea,
began to dissolve in mist. He stretched
out his hands imploringly, as if to
stay the wondrous vision in its flight;
but he struck at empty air, and sank
gently towards the earth. An echo
from afar wafted him an answer, which
seemed a promise that the cloud-land
would receive him once more at
some distant day, but the words were
rather a command than an encouragement:</p>

<p>"Work is prayer, work is song."</p>

<p>And now a scene broke upon his
sight, which made him think he was
back among the apple-orchards and
smiling farms of Normandy&mdash;a fair
and tranquil scene: wide meadows,
with flocks of kine grazing, fields of
corn ripe for the sickle, and orchards,
round which girls and boys were
frolicking in holiday costume. Beyond
that was a village of white huts
and a church all of wood, its porch
hung with evergreens, and a wedding-party
grouped beneath; and
through the landscape the same river
on whose banks Robert thought he
had fallen asleep once years ago,
when it flowed through the heart of
the primeval forest. Higher up in
the distance were still the old pine-woods;
but there was much timber
felled, and great rafts were paddled
down the stream, laden with the
wealth of the forest. Robert knew
that civilization had come to this
spot with a cross in its hand instead
of a sword, and baptismal dews
instead of "fire-water." He saw the
bronzed, athletic men of the New
World working like brothers side by
side with the stalwart, golden-haired
pilgrims from the Old; and he looked
around to see who had thus brought
about that which his former experience
had sadly told him was an impossibility.
Just then there rose a
chant from the village church:</p>

<p>"Sing to the Lord a new song.
Offer up the sacrifice of justice and
hope in the Lord, ... who showeth
us good things.... By the fruit of
their corn, and wine, and oil are
they multiplied"; while from the
fields where the red man and the
white toiled together rose an answering
chorus: "Behold how good and
pleasant it is for brethren to dwell
together in unity." Then from the
church came a long file of dark-robed
men, with cowls of ancient make, like
those that the Norman boy had seen
carved on the monuments of the
abbots in his own land&mdash;nay, his own
village (for Villeneuve had once belonged
to the Benedictines)&mdash;and they
marched in slow procession to a spot
of ground a mile beyond the gathering
of white huts.</p>

<p>Here a large area was marked out
in the shape of a cross, the outline
being drawn in wreaths of gaily-colored
autumn leaves. Many Indians
stood round the enclosure, and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
old chief kept in his hands a quantity
of wampum belts. Opposite him
was a man of athletic build, nearly
seventy years old, in whom Robert
thought he saw a great likeness to
himself as he might become in a
happy and prosperous old age. The
chief of the dark-robed men lifted up
his voice, and addressed this figure:</p>

<p>"Robert Maillard"&mdash;and the
dreamer started to hear his own name&mdash;"this
day you end a noble work;
you crown a life worthy to be held
in remembrance for ever. You came
to this spot a wanderer without an
aim, at war with man, almost despairing
of God. You stand here, after
half a century has gone over your
head, the father of your people, the
benefactor of two races, the founder,
so to speak, of a new kingdom. You
crown the sacrifice of a lifetime used
in God's service by a free gift of your
choicest possession to his everlasting
majesty. To all ages will a school of
holy discipline and of sacred song
plead for you at the throne of God,
and the <i lang="la">laus perennis</i> of holy lives
shall represent the ceaseless hymn of
inanimate creation to its Lord."</p>

<p>Then the old man turned to the
Indian chief, and called him. "My
brother," he said, "I have only
given to God what you gave me;
without a fair title to your land, I
durst not have offered it to the God
whose eldest child on this side of the
sea is the red man; and half the
blessing which this reverend minister
of our Lord has promised me falls
to your share."</p>

<p>"My pale-faced brother speaks
words of justice and of wisdom,"
answered the chief; "his God shall
be my God, and his people my people,
because his faith has taught him
truth and honesty towards his red
brother. The black-robe hath spoken
well, and Great Eagle is glad to
hear him praise the friend of his people,
and he who hath taught the Indian
maidens to sing the song of the
stars and the clouds."</p>

<p>So saying, he laid at the priest's
feet a wampum belt; and as each
ceremony of the laying of a first stone
was completed, he laid down another,
as if ratifying the compact after the
manner of his people. The dreamer
stood apart in silent wonder; the
dark-robed choir intoned the psalm
<em>Lauda Jerusalem</em>:</p>

<p>"Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem!
Praise thy God, O Sion!"</p>

<p>"For he hath strengthened the
bars of thy gates; he hath blessed
thy children within thee.</p>

<p>"He hath made peace within thy
borders, and filleth thee with the fatness
of corn."</p>

<p>At last the procession turned back
towards the white church, and all the
people, Indians as well as white men,
joined its ranks. Robert followed
last of all, and an echo to the song
of joy and praise rose from his enlightened
heart, whispering:</p>

<p>"Work is prayer, work is song."</p>

<p>He looked around; he knew the
spot well; a little higher up the
stream was the place where he had
rested at noontide, before his eyes
were opened to the true mission allotted
him in life. He knew that
this was the warning, which, if he
neglected it, would make of him no
longer an innocent dreamer, but a
useless vagabond, a rebellious creature
of God. If poetry and beauty,
truth and honesty, were things of the
past, it was at least the duty of every
Christian to do what he could to
make them once more things of the
present. No man who owed allegiance
to the great Maker of all things could
go idly through life, a vain mourner
over an impossible ideal; he must
bear his share of work, and do his
utmost to build up anew the spiritual
temple of truth. And he, above all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
who had been led through the secret
treasure-houses of nature, and had listened
to the ceaseless hymn of praise
which the creatures of God sang as
they followed the immutable laws set
down for them by their Lord&mdash;he,
above all, dared not stand still nor
refuse the tribute of his voice. He
would not be an alien among his
brethren, the children of God. With
these thoughts, he slowly followed
the crowd as it filled the little church,
and broke out again into strains of
solemn gladness, singing:</p>

<p>"Now dost thou dismiss thy servant
in peace, O Lord, according to
thy word; for my eyes have seen thy
salvation."</p>

<p>The song grew fainter, and the
multitude seemed to dissolve before
his eyes, as Robert, standing up,
gazed around him. Everywhere the
primeval forest hemmed him in; the
river flowed at his feet, clogged with
mossy boulders, and fringed with
delicate fern; the squirrels rattled in
the trees with a sound like castanets;
and the silvery disk of the moon was
just visible over the tree-tops. The
young wanderer knew that he had
slept for many hours; but he awoke
a new being. Reverently he gazed
upon the silent landscape, to which a
fellowship beyond the expression of
human tongues now bound him; and,
as he repeated slowly the prayers
that he had said at his mother's knee
in the old Norman homestead, he felt
that at last his life's work had been
pointed out to him. He had read
the pages of a book more wonderful
than the romances of troubadours,
the tales of the Minnesingers, and
even the chronicles of olden abbeys;
he had heard how the world was
bound by a chain of song, never
ceasing, never wearying; and henceforth
his frail human life must not
mar this awe-inspiring harmony; his
heart must throb with the world's
heart, his voice sing in unison with
the great voice of creation. Night
passed, and he scarcely slept; morning
came, and found him still in his
holy rapture. Before long, an Indian
approached him&mdash;a tall and stately
son of the forest, one still uncorrupted
by the thinly veiled heathenism of the
white "children of the sun." He
had never seen a white man, though
he had often heard of them. Robert
knew a little of some of the Indian
tongues, but not that of the new-comer.
What with signs and a few
words akin to those which the Indian
spoke, they gradually made friends;
but the red man still gazed upon
Robert with an awe not unmixed with
terror. He handled his weapons and
his garments, touched reverentially
his fair and tangled locks, and at intervals
drew long breaths of astonishment
and admiration. He then led
him to the assembly of his tribe, and
Robert soon learnt enough of their
language to be able to speak fluently
with them. He told them how he
came there, and spoke to them of the
true God; and, though at first they
listened quietly, they soon grew grave.
They had heard of the cruelty and
treachery of white men, who all professed
to believe in this true God, and
they dared not trust to this teaching.</p>

<p>Then Robert had a happy inspiration.
He told them of his dream,
and they brightened up at once; this
was language such as they loved to
hear; these were parables such as
they instinctively understood. He
told them of his life in Normandy,
of his journey across the great salt
water, of his longings after a beautiful
land of brotherly love, such as
had been shown to him in his dream.
He asked them to help him in his
work for God.</p>

<p>We cannot dwell longer on the
details of the story of this settlement
in the wilderness, but some things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
must be briefly touched upon. In
due time, the Indian tribe gave
Robert a grant of many miles of land,
and he, in return, promised them protection,
justice, equality, and peace.
One priest at first, then gradually
others, came to preach the Gospel;
and the path of truth was exceptionally
smooth in this strange oasis.
Robert called his settlement by a
name which few at first could understand&mdash;Perpetual
Praise. Parts of the
forest were cleared; a thriving lumber
trade was established; cottages
sprang up; many emigrants from fair
Normandy flocked in, yet settlers of
other lands were all welcomed as
brothers; a civilization that was
rather that of the monastery than of
the factory sprang up, and Indians
and whites worshipped God side by
side in joy and peace.</p>

<p>As years went by, Robert took an
Indian wife, and loved her as faithfully
as though she had been the
princess of some chivalric romance:
he had found his ideal at last. Sometimes&mdash;it
was impossible that it
should be otherwise&mdash;there would be
a ripple of adversity over the smooth
waters of this pastoral life; crime
might throw a shadow on the settlement;
but peace was promptly restored,
and Robert became known as the
justest and most merciful judge for
hundreds of miles around. He was
the arbiter and referee of every feud,
the father of his colony, the terror of
evil-doers. Over his house-door&mdash;a
wide, open-armed porch where his
Indian sons, with locks of bronze,
played the games of infant Samsons
at his feet&mdash;was carved in crimson
letters this brave motto:</p>

<p>"Work is prayer, work is song."</p>

<p>As his years advanced, he grew
more thoughtful yet. One idea remained
unrealized; and now that the
settlement had had a life almost as
long as the third of a century, he felt
that it was time to begin the new
and crowning work. He negotiated
with the Benedictine abbeys of
France, and held out hopes to them
of the free gift of at least five hundred
acres of land for the foundation of a
priory of their order, together with a
school of missionaries for the Indians,
and for the revival of sacred chant&mdash;a
study Robert had greatly at heart.
He received very favorable answers
and, before he died, he saw the wish
of his heart in a fair way to be accomplished.</p>

<p>The day of the arrival of the first
Benedictine monks was a festival
throughout the settlement. Indian
and European decorations vied with
each other; beads, feathers, flags,
lanterns of painted birch-bark, flowers
strewn on the paths, wreaths
hung from tree to tree, all represented
but poorly the heartfelt enthusiasm
of the people. In a few months, the
old chant of the church in the early
ages echoed through the woods and
corn-fields of the New World; the
Divine Office was sung in the intervals
of agricultural labor; seven
times a day did the bells utter their
summons to prayer, yet the fields
and flocks thrived none the less for
this continuous intercession. The
boys of red and white race mingled
their locks of black and gold, poring
over the books of church psalmody;
the maidens and matrons joined in
from their seats in the body of the
church. The wilderness became
populous, great artists came to sketch
the stately figures of the monks and
the innocent faces of the choristers
as they moved from choir to ploughed
field, from school to pasture; curious
folks came to visit the little
spot of land where a great experiment
had been tried and had not failed;
musicians came to seek rest for their
minds and inspiration for their art;
poets came to describe the new Ar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>cadia,
and holy men to praise God
in the temple where such great graces
had been conferred.</p>

<p>Robert Maillard began to fear that
such publicity would endanger the
very perfection which was the theme
of admiration, and with redoubled fervor
did he pray for his beloved work.
As last came a day when he knew
that his earthly task was over; like
a patriarch among his people, he
gathered the heads of the little community
around him, and blessed
them, exhorting them to persevere
in the happy and innocent life of
"Perpetual Praise." His wife knelt
at his feet, his sons stood around
him, and one of them led by the
hand a young child, whose eyes
were Indian eyes, but whose skin was
nearly as fair as that of her grandfather.</p>

<p>The Benedictine monks stood
around Robert's bedside, chanting
the Divine Office; but suddenly the
dying man raised his hands to heaven,
and, mingling his voice with
the song of Compline, called out
clearly and joyously, as if in answer
to some interior voice: "I come, O
Lord! Work has been prayer; be it
now song."</p>

<h3>ENGLISH SKETCHES.</h3>


<h4>II.<br />

RUINS OF AN OLD ABBEY.</h4>

<p>In the year of grace 1121, Henry
I. was reigning in England. On the
sudden death of his brother, William
Rufus, he had seized the crown, which
devolved by right on the next elder
brother, Robert of Normandy, Robert
being just then absent in the Holy
Land, where, by military exploits of
high renown and sweet courtesy of
manner, he was winning the hearts
of his soldiers and of Christendom.
Hearing how things were going in
England, he set sail in haste for
Normandy; and there calling a fleet
together, he steered towards Dover,
where the usurper, apprised of his
arrival, stood with an army drawn up
upon the shore awaiting him. For
three days and nights the brothers
stood at bay, like two tigers ready
to fly at one another's throats, but
neither daring to strike the first blow
in their fratricidal war. Presently we
see gliding high up along the cliffs a
venerable figure, clad in priestly garb,
and bearing an olive branch in his
hand. His name is Anselm. He
has been roughly handled by Rufus,
and has little kindness to expect from
his successor. But Anselm heeds not
his own interest or his life; he goes
boldly forward, and with outstretched
hand entreats the brothers to desist
from their bloody intent, to exchange
the kiss of peace, and settle their
quarrel as became men and Christians.
They hearkened to the voice
of the saintly primate. This was his
first service to Henry, and it was
quickly followed by others so numerous
and so important that the scholarly
king, moved partly by gratitude,
and partly by a desire to atone for
certain of his own and his predecessor's
misdemeanors towards the
church, resolved, in 1121, to build a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
monastery which should be one of the
glories of his reign, and bear witness
to the end of time to his devout allegiance
to the faith. With this view
he built the Benedictine Abbey of
Reading. It was on so royal a scale,
both of magnitude and architectural
splendor, that even now, in their utter
dilapidation, the fragments of the
cyclopean ruins give us no inadequate
idea of what it must have been in the
days of its strength and glory. The
gigantic skeleton walls, as they stand
out gaunt and ragged against the sky,
resemble rather rocks than the remains
of the work of puny human
hands. The style was in the massive
and lofty Norman Gothic of the period,
as may be seen from the few
bold arches that have withstood alike
the ravages of time, the artillery of
Cromwell, and modern depredations.
The abbey was one of the wealthiest
in the kingdom, and the mitred abbot
was counted among the notable authorities
of the land. He not only
took rank with the highest nobles,
but he enjoyed, likewise, many of the
supreme prerogatives of royalty; he
was privileged to coin money, and to
confer the honor of knighthood. He
exercised hospitality to kings and
princes, and that right royally. King
Henry, the founder, was a frequent
guest at the monastery with his court,
who were entertained there for weeks
at a time with regal magnificence.
The king was extremely fond of the
abbey and the monks, and made it
his custom to spend Holy Week
there every year. After performing
his Paschal duties in company with
his family and his court, and passing
the solemn week in fasting and prayer,
he celebrated the joyful Easter dawn
with a festive merriment, in which all
the town was invited to join. Bonfires
blazed on every surrounding hill,
ale ran in the gutters, the poor were
clad and fed, and all within reach of
the royal bounty felt the joy of the
Paschal alleluia. Queen Adeliza
shared her husband's partiality for
this lordly monastic retreat, and at
various festivals through the year repaired
to it, sometimes with her son,
sometimes only with her women-in-waiting.
When Henry died of overindulgence
in his favorite dish of
lampreys, at Rouen, he directed that
his heart should remain there, but
that his body should rest under the
roof of his beloved Benedictine abbey.
After his demise, it still continued
to be a royal residence, and
was often frequented by Henry II.,
who held a parliament there for the
first time in 1184&mdash;an example which
was followed repeatedly in the course
of the succeeding reigns; the calm
of the cloister offering a fitter atmosphere
for grave deliberation to the
law-makers than the hall of Westminster,
disturbed as it was by courtly
intrigues and political agitations. In
1452, Parliament was adjourned to
Reading Abbey from Westminster, on
account of the sudden outbreak of
the plague, and later, in 1466, for the
same reason. It was the scene of
other meetings not devoid of historical
importance. Here the Patriarch
of Jerusalem, Heraclius, visited Henry
II., and presented him with the keys
of the Holy Sepulchre and the royal
banners of the city, in hopes of
luring him to undertake another crusade
for the deliverance of the holy
places.</p>

<p>Henry III. passed more of his time
at Reading Abbey than at any of his
own palaces; here he convoked assemblies
of the nobles, and received
brother princes and European guests
of distinction. It was in the west hall
of the monastery that Edward IV. received
his fair young queen, Elizabeth
Widville. In this same hall Longchamp,
Bishop of Ely, who had the
regency in the absence of Richard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
Cœur de Lion in Palestine, was put
upon his trial. Two other ecclesiastical
councils were held here in the
reign of John. When Richard II.,
through the intervention of John of
Gaunt, was reconciled to his nobles,
he chose Reading Abbey as the
ground of meeting. So it continued,
up to the reign of Henry VIII., the
resort of kings, and nobles, and prelates,
until that ruthless despoiler passed
an act for the suppression of
monasteries, and converted the sacred
precincts into a palace for his own
sole use. The monks were scattered,
and their brave and loyal abbot,
Hugh Farringdon, having dared to
denounce the iniquitous edict and
defy the king, was sentenced to be
hanged, drawn, and quartered. With
him closes the line of the Benedictine
abbots. It is curious to see
Henry VIII., after thus uprooting the
church in his dominions, plundering
her treasure, and persecuting her in
every way, leaving a large sum of
money in his will for "Masses to be
said for the deliverance of his soul."
He had made it high treason to hold
the doctrine of purgatory, or to pray
for the dead; and the act of saying
Mass was punishable with death. He
had overturned altars and banished
priests; yet, when he came to die himself,
he turned, in abject and cowardly
fear, towards the church that he had
so outraged, and besought her help in
his extremity. Speaking of this act
of Henry's, which throws such a
sinister light on his fanatical hatred
to Catholicism, and his violent enforcement
of the "reformed religion,"
as it was styled, Hume, whose statements
are as accurate as his views are
false, remarks naïvely that it is a
proof of the tenacity of superstition
on the human mind, and says that it
was one amongst so many of "the
strange contrarieties of his conduct
and temper," that he who had "destroyed
those foundations made by
his ancestors for the deliverance of
<em>their</em> souls," should when it came to
be the hour of death "take care to
be on the safer side of the question
himself." At the time of the dissolution,
the revenues in money of this
royal abbey did not exceed the
small sum of £675 a year. Its
wealth consisted not in accumulated
riches, but in lands, and fisheries, and
flocks, and herds. Many English
sovereigns had bequeathed their dust
to the consecrated shelter of Reading
Abbey; amongst others, the Empress
Matilda, wife of Henry I., and
mother of Henry II., had been interred
in its vaults. Their ashes found
no mercy at the hands of the infuriated
fanatics, who seemed bent on
erasing from the face of the country
every vestige of its ancient faith.
The majestic pile, which had witnessed
so many royal marriages, and
echoed to the dirges of so many sovereigns,
fell before the cannon of
Cromwell, planted on Caversham hill.
The beautiful church of S. Thomas
à Becket, where the unfortunate
Charles I., with a little band of his
trusty cavaliers, had halted and knelt
in prayer for protection against the
mad soldiery before whom they fled,
fared no better than the rest. The walls
that still exist bear traces at every
point of this savage act of vandalism.
What the fury of the Roundheads
left unfinished the more recent vandals
have completed. The ruins have
been plundered of every vestige of
stone-facing; and those immense
blocks that gave the old pile, even in
its decay, such an air of imperishable
strength and grandeur were, at great
cost of labor and money, torn away
and carried to Windsor, to serve in
building the Poor Knights' Hospital.
Some were condemned to the more
ignoble use of erecting a bridge over
the Wargrave Road. It is difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
to go beyond mere speculation in
fixing the spots illustrated by so
many memorable associations in the
history of the old abbey. There can
be no mistake, however, about the
Chapter Hall, where the parliaments
were held, and where kings and prelates
feasted. There is a tradition
that after the battle of Newbury,
Charles I. and all his troops were
daily fed for a considerable time in
the refectory of the monks, one wall
alone of which is now standing, but
which quite justifies the supposition
of this wholesale hospitality when we
see the area formerly occupied by
the apartment. The site of the
church is also discernible, but the
relative positions of the altars, transepts,
and nave are but dimly suggested
by the broken bases of the
four enormous pillars that supported
the towering dome. The present
beautiful little Catholic church, with
its adjoining presbytery, is built entirely
from the ruins, so cruelly dismantled
by successive goths. But all
their efforts have failed to obliterate
the royal aspect of the wreck, or to
rob it of its air of immortality. The
walls are built of sharp, small flint, imbedded
in mortar that has now become
as hard as iron&mdash;a circumstance
which we may hope will put an
end to any further devastation, as the
tools of the workmen break like glass
in the effort to penetrate it and dislodge
the flint.</p>

<p>A fact that added to Reading Abbey
a higher kind of interest than any
earthly privilege can convey was
that it possessed the hand of S. James
the Apostle&mdash;a relic which had been
brought from Germany to France
by the Empress Matilda, and given
by her to her father, Henry I., who
presented it to the Benedictine monks
encased in a rich shrine of gold,
where devout worshippers came
from great distances to venerate it.
When the dissolution of monastic
orders was decreed, the sacred relics
which each community possessed were
secreted in secure places, and often
defended from outrage at the peril
and sacrifice of life; but no mention
is anywhere to be found of similar
precautions being employed in the
case of the famous Benedictine treasure.
The Roundheads desecrated
the tombs of the kings, and threw to
the winds the bones of the monks
who slept in the vaults around them;
but we find no trace of insult offered
to the hand of S. James, nor is any
notice taken of it in the local chronicles
of Reading from this time forth.
There was a vague rumor of its having
been conveyed to a convent in
Spain; but no evidence of the slightest
description supports this notion.
About seventy years ago, some workmen,
employed in breaking down a
portion of the walls, came upon a
small wooden box containing a human
hand; it was bought as a curiosity
for a mere trifle by a physician
of the town, and after a while, we
know not how or wherefore, it found
its way to the Museum of the Polytechnic,
where it remained until that
institution was broken up; then the
hand was transferred to the Athenæum,
in Friar Street. Meantime,
the circumstance of the discovery
had travelled far beyond Berks, and
some devout persons, believing this
could be none other than the lost
relic of S. James, offered considerable
sums for it; but, for some reason
that we can neither discover nor surmise,
these offers were declined, and
the hand remained "amongst other
nick-nacks" to which some interest,
historical or otherwise, was attached.
Finally, the vicissitudes of fortune carried
it to a shop-window, where it
was long to be seen under a glass
case so insecurely guarded that any
expert thief might easily have pur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>loined
it. A Scotch Catholic gentleman
saw it here, and offered fifty
pounds for it. It was sold to him
for this sum, and he placed it in the
care of Canon B&mdash;&mdash;, the dean of
the church which is built on the
original resting-place of the real relic,
and dedicated to S. James. It was
with the understanding, however,
that he would claim the hand as
soon as he had a suitable place for
it in his own house. Canon B&mdash;&mdash;
himself was strongly inclined to disbelieve
in the genuineness of the relic.
In the first place, the box in which it
was found bore no sign or symbol
of its being a reliquary, and there
was no mark or seal attached to the
contents indicating their character;
then, again, the hand was small and
the fingers tapering, much more like
the hand of a woman than of a rude-limbed
fisherman like the Apostle
of Spain. There was one way of
ascertaining with certainty that it
was <em>not</em> the real hand, and this
was by learning whether the body
of S. James, which is preserved
in the Cathedral of Compostela,
wanted one hand. If the two were
there, there was an end of the controversy,
and it would be clearly proved
that the hand found at Reading
Abbey had been, at some unknown
date, returned to its place. If one
hand was missing, and if that corresponded
to the one in his possession,
it was at least a strong argument
on the side of its genuineness, which
other steps should be thenceforth
taken to prove. At the canon's
request, Dr. Grant, the late saintly
Bishop of Southwark, wrote to the
Archbishop of Compostela, asking
him to allow the shrine to be opened
and the necessary inspection
of the relics made; but the archbishop
replied that he could on no
pretext, however laudable, consent to
such an act, which, in his eyes, appeared
like a desecration of their venerated
patron. The question fell back,
therefore, into impenetrable doubt as
before. The hand remained at Reading,
until at last the purchaser arrived
and claimed it. He was persuaded
that it was the real hand of S. James,
and as such claimed to have it in his
possession and under his roof. Canon
B&mdash;&mdash; gave it up at once; but it
was remarked by a pious Catholic at
the time that if it was the real relic,
the act of <em>purchasing</em> it for private
possession, and removing it from a
church dedicated to the apostle to
whom it was supposed to belong, to
a private house, could bring no blessing
on those connected with it.
These warnings were laughed at as
superstitious by the owner of the
relic; but they were strangely and
fearfully fulfilled before long. He
and three clerical friends were one
day seized at dinner with agonizing
pains, and, after a few hours' suffering,
expired. One of the dishes had,
by some unaccountable accident,
been poisoned by the cook, who had
employed some venomous root in
mistake for horse-radish. We do
not attach for a moment any supernatural
significance to the incident,
but merely give it as a strange coincidence.
After this violent and
sudden death of its owner, the hand
passed into the possession of a relative,
to whom he bequeathed it. Perhaps
this short record of its recent history
may meet the eye of some one who
may be induced to search out the
missing limb, and clear away the
mystery that still hangs over the supposed
relic of the apostle who warned
us so solemnly against the iniquity
of idle words. Who knows? Perhaps
we may yet live to see a Benedictine
monastery rise on the site of the
ancient one where his hand was so
devoutly venerated; monks, wearing
the dark cowl of the inspired author<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
of the <cite>Regula Monachorum</cite>, may
again tread the hallowed ground of
the old abbey, where in bygone
days their fathers lived grand and awful
lives under the serene and solemn
shadow of their mighty cloisters, adjusting
the strife of nations and of
kings, teaching Christendom, feeding
the poor, and taking the kingdom
of heaven by violence amidst long
vigils, and fasting, and humiliation,
and the heroic practice of Christian
sanctity; the old stones may yet
echo to the chant of psalms as
in the days of our forefathers, and
the song of praise resound again
in the desert&mdash;the same words,
with other voices; for God changes
not, neither does his church; for,
like her Founder, she is immutable,
the same yesterday, to-day, and for
ever.</p>

<h3>THE COURT OF FRANCE IN 1830.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></h3>


<p class="center">BY M. MENNECHET.</p>

<p class="center">FROM PARIS, OU LE LIVRE DES CENT-ET-UN.
</p>

<p>You think, my dear friend and editor,
that the place occupied by the
Tuileries in the panorama of Paris is
so prominent a one that you desire to
include a variety of accounts of it in
the rich gallery of description you
are now giving to the world, and
you ask me, unskilful artist though I
am, to draw you a faithful picture of
its interior as I once knew it. You
say that, having for fifteen years inhabited
this palace, I must necessarily
be well acquainted with all the details
of it, and you wish me to take upon
myself the office of introducing your
numerous readers, and of giving
them a nearer view of the chief personages
of this royal domain. I
may, you add, imagine myself once
more at my bureau, distributing to
curiosity or to attachment tickets of
admission for some <i lang="fr">fête</i> or ceremony,
and that this will perhaps prove, for
the time being, a pleasant illusion
for me. Dreams like these, however,
would possess no attraction for me.
I have been too near a spectator of
the court for it to have any illusions
for my mind. In this respect, I may
compare myself to an actor at the
theatre, over-familiar with the scenes
of the green-room. I need realities
now to awaken my interest; and
since the course of events has plunged
me again into my original obscurity,
I can no longer abandon myself
to reveries of pride or of ambition.
Nor had I risen so high that there
was any danger that my fall would
distract my reason or shake my philosophy.
I had reached only that
elevation which gives to objects their
due proportions. I was neither too
near nor too far, neither too high
nor too low, not to be able to see and
to judge calmly; and it is in my former
observatory that I am now
about to replace myself, in order to
comply, as far as it may lie in my
power, with your request. Perhaps
I ought to fear that it may be said
of me, He served the exiled family
for fifteen years; he was indebted to
them for his maintenance and that
of others connected with him; he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
biassed by feelings of gratitude; we
cannot but distrust what he is about
to tell us. God forbid that the reproach
of fidelity and gratitude
should ever offend me: these are
virtues too rare for any one who is
conscious in his own heart of possessing
them to be ashamed of the
fact. If, therefore, I should be accused
of flattery, I shall not feel
much grieved at the charge; for at
least I shall have flattered only the
unfortunate. Had not the sanguinary
events of July shattered at one
blow the crown of Charlemagne,
the sceptre of S. Louis, and the
sword of Henri IV.; did the family of
Charles X. now reign at the Tuileries,
I might be silent, lest my encomiums
should be deemed interested; or
were I to take up my pen, it would
only be to demonstrate that the liberal
ideas of the youth of the present
day were even then admitted
to the court; there was no exclusion,
excepting for revolutionary principles.</p>

<p>Here might be a fine opportunity
for me to enter upon a chapter of
politics. I might prove to the partisans
of the sovereignty of the people
that they alone invoke the divine
right, since the voice of the people
passes for the voice of God&mdash;<i lang="la">Vox populi,
vox Dei</i>; or, on the other hand,
that their adversaries do well to
range themselves on the side of hereditary
right, which is a principle
of order and security, as well for
governments as for families&mdash;a right
sacred and inviolable, and which has
existed unquestioned from the days
of Adam until the present time.</p>

<p>But I should find myself quite out
of my sphere in the domain of politics,
having always withheld myself
from its complications. I therefore
give your readers notice that I shall
not introduce them into the great
cabinet in which the councils of the
ministers were held. I was not admitted
there myself; and as I never
listened at the doors, it would be
impossible for me to relate anything
that took place. All I know is that
under the last ministry they used
three sheets of paper too much, since
the latter kindled so deplorable a
conflagration.</p>

<p>The exterior aspect of the Tuileries
is doubtless well known to my readers,
at least from description, or
through pictures or engravings. But
those who have never had the opportunity
of penetrating further I now
invite to follow me into the interior,
while I endeavor to bring before them
some of the <i lang="fr">fêtes</i> and ceremonies of
the court of Charles X. Unless you
are in full dress, let us not enter by
the great staircase. There we should
find a man, who is called a <em>Suisse</em>,
although he is a Frenchman, who
would tell you that etiquette does
not permit you to enter the palace of
the king wearing boots. You might
exclaim against etiquette, forgetting,
however, that, at least, it imposes upon
vanity the obligation of enriching
labor. The staircase by which I
shall introduce you is free from such
restrictions. You will find the steps
much worn. They lead to the treasury
of charities&mdash;a treasury quite the
opposite of the cask of the Danaïdes;
for although it be constantly drawn
from, it is never empty.</p>

<p>Let us ascend another flight, and
cross the <em>black gallery</em>, where, on the
right and left sides, are lodged, in
narrow and inconvenient rooms, the
great lord and the <i lang="fr">valet de chambre</i>,
the <i lang="fr">maître d'hotel</i> and the physician,
the <em>aide-de-camp</em> and the chaplain,
the gentleman and the plebeian.
Here all ranks, all grades, all dignities,
are confounded. When we shall
repair to the final judgment, I suppose
we shall all pass through a black
gallery, in which, like that of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
Tuileries, will be mingled all social
ranks. We will now descend a flight,
and enter the apartment of the first
gentleman of the chamber, one of the
great officers of the household. Let
us request of him tickets of admission
to the ceremony of the Supper; and,
when we shall have obtained them
from his habitual complaisance, let
us hope that there may not have
been, the night before, between him,
the captain of the guards, and the
grand-master of ceremonies, any dispute
regarding the rights, privileges,
and attributes of their respective
offices. In that case it is by no
means certain that the life-guardsman
would permit us to enter, the password
being frequently regulated by
some petty revenge of the chief.
This time, however, all is harmonious;
the life-guardsman has made no objection,
the usher has taken our tickets,
and the <i lang="fr">valet de chambre</i> has
indicated our places behind the ladies.
What an interesting tableau is presented
by this religious solemnity!
The chapel of the château being too
small for the occasion, the gallery of
Diana has been arranged for the ceremony.
I see you smile as you raise
your eyes to gaze upon the rich
paintings which decorate the ceiling
of this gallery. Cupid and Psyche,
Diana and Endymion, Hercules and
Omphale&mdash;all these gods and goddesses
of paganism appear, little in
keeping with the scene of a Christian
celebration. But lower your eyes;
look at this simple altar, at this pulpit,
from which the minister of God
will shortly speak, and you will no
longer be tempted to smile, for you
will have realized the distance which
separates truth from error.</p>

<p>At one of the extremities of the
gallery is laid an immense table, on
which thirteen dishes of different
kinds are thirteen times repeated.
Each one of them is decorated with
fragrant flowers, which exhale a delicious
perfume. Along the entire
length of the gallery are placed,
right and left, three rows of benches.
On one side are seated the ladies,
whose elegant costumes are, it is true,
somewhat worldly; but the books
they hold in their hands attest, at
least, their pious intentions.</p>

<p>Facing the pews reserved for the
royal family, and on more elevated
benches, are ranged thirteen poor
young children, representing the thirteen
apostles; for, at the time of the
Supper, Judas had not denied his
Master. Behind these are placed
the musicians of the king, at their
head Cherubini and Lesueur, and
directed by Plantade; this combination
of talent exhibiting a taste and
power of execution unrivalled at that
period, and which will still be remembered
by many who have had the
privilege of listening to them.</p>

<p>But suddenly a voice is heard&mdash;"The
king." All advance, lean forward,
and endeavor to obtain a view
of him. He salutes all with the grace
so natural to him; and respect alone
represses the demonstration which
his kindness seems to encourage.
The divine office begins; at its conclusion
comes the sermon; and finally,
carrying out the pious custom of the
kings of France, he himself washes
the feet of the thirteen apostles as a
token of Christian humility. The
impious may smile at these touching
solemnities of the worship of their
forefathers; had they once assisted at
a ceremony like this, they would smile
no more. Afterwards, the officers of
the household advance in a procession,
holding in their hands the insignia
of their office and bouquets. After
them marches the dauphin of
France, followed by the high officers.
Thirteen times in succession they approach
the table to seek the bread,
the wine, the different dishes intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
for the representatives of the apostles.
They carry them to the king, who
deposits them in baskets at the feet
of each child. To these gifts he adds
a purse for each, containing thirteen
five-franc pieces. Then the ceremony
is over, and the king may say to himself,
"I have not only fulfilled an act
of devotion and humility; I have also
made thirteen families happy."</p>

<p>Having beheld the Most Christian
King stooping from his royal majesty
to those whom Père Bridaine called
the best friends of God, let us now
view him in that ceremony which
alone, until lately, recalled the ancient
traditions of chivalry. Here he
is not only King of France; he is
Grand Master of the Order of the
Holy Ghost. This order, founded
by Henri III., and which all the
sovereigns of Europe were proud and
happy to wear; this order, which decorated
the breast of Henri IV., of
Louis XIV., and of all the great warriors
and statesmen of the last two
centuries; this order, the most glorious
recompense, and the one most
coveted by the celebrated personages
of the beginning of the present epoch,
is at an end&mdash;the late revolution did
not choose that it should survive the
monarchy.</p>

<p>The last ceremony of the Order
of the Holy Ghost took place on
May 30, 1830, at Whitsuntide. The
most perfect taste and the greatest
luxury were displayed in the hangings
which decorated the great vestibule
and the stone gallery that lead to
the chapel; the ingenious and varied
talents of Hittorf, Lecointe, and
Ciceri being brought into requisition
on this occasion. The chapter of the
order was held at eleven o'clock in
the grand cabinet. There were assembled,
in their rich costumes of
black velvet, embroidered with gold
and faced with green silk, the knights
already received into the number,
wearing crosswise the collar of the
order, and on their cloaks the silver
plates&mdash;the brilliant insignia of their
dignity. The king, the natural nobility
of whose appearance was enhanced
by this picturesque costume,
opened the assembled chapter; then
the cortége took up their march to
the chapel, where the knights lately
promoted were to be received. They
marched in double-file through rows,
on either hand, of ladies elegantly
dressed; the bystanders gazed eagerly
on the knights as they advanced,
and many satirical remarks were
made upon the singular junction of
the new celebrities with the members
of the old aristocracy.</p>

<p>There walked together the Duc
la Tremouille and M. Lainè, M.
Ravez and the Duc de Montmorency.</p>

<p>To show how ambition may attain
its ends by different paths, the Duc
de Décaze and the Comte de Villete,
the Comte de Peyronnet and the
Duc de Dalmatie; and as if to demonstrate
how differently two gentlemen
may comprehend the duties of their
position, the Duc de Mortemart and
the Vicomte de Châteaubriand.</p>

<p>An especial circumstance added
the attraction of curiosity while it
lent a more touching interest to this
scene; the king received as Chevalier
of the Order of the Holy Ghost the
young Duc de Nemours, in the presence
of all his family. All those
who were present on this occasion
cannot fail to remember the noble
and gracious air of the young prince,
and the deep emotion perceptible in
the voice of the august old man as
he defined the duties of a true knight.
One might have supposed him a
father, happy and proud to find in
his son a heart in which the seeds
of honor and loyalty must necessarily
germinate. All the spectators were
moved. A mother wept. Would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
that these had been the last tears she
was destined to shed!</p>

<p>Let us now pass from this grave
and imposing ceremonial to those
animated and joyous <i lang="fr">fêtes</i> which
took place every year at Saint-Cloud
on the day of S. Henri. Shall I
show you the <em>Trocadere</em>, filled with
games of every description, shops of
all kinds, in which the most famous
actors of the capital, transformed
into foreign merchants, distributed to
all comers songs, toys, bonbons, and
flowers, all for the trifling remuneration
of thanks? Will you assist with
the whole court at that brilliant representation
of the heroic drama of
<cite>Bissen</cite>, in which Franconi and his
actors, men and horses, give proofs
of such rare intelligence and address?
At the conclusion of this spectacle,
the Duc de Bordeaux<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> assembles
his little army of children, and before
the eyes of the astonished crowd
causes them to manœuvre with all
the coolness and experience of a veteran
captain; then he leads them to
the gymnastic games, in which he
surpasses them all in strength, daring,
and skill. Then, mingling with the
soldiers of a neighboring post, he
plays at quoits with the latter as if
with comrades; but he takes care to
lose the game just as he is on the
point of winning it, so as to be generous
without the appearance of it.
Perhaps you might be interested to
know that this promising child likewise
ardently devotes himself to his
studies under the care of his admirable
instructors, MM. de Barande
and Colart, and more especially to
the history of his country; he obstinately
refuses to call the Constable
of Bourbon anything but the <em>bad Constable</em>,
asserting that he has forfeited
his right even to his name, having
borne arms against his sovereign.</p>

<p>But whither have my reminiscences
carried me? Here we are at
Saint-Cloud; the games of a child
have made me forget the pomps of a
court, and, besides, I was only to
speak to you of the Tuileries.</p>

<p>This court was not wanting in
brilliancy; its luxury, however, was
by no means extreme. These three
hundred gentlemen of the chamber,
these equerries, these officers of ceremony
for the household and hunting
service, richly dressed in vestments
embroidered in gold, were
tributaries to industry, and willingly
paid the tax of vanity. We too often
forget that the bread of the poor
is in the hands of the rich, and that it
is better for the former that this bread
should be the price of labor than the
gift of charity.</p>

<p>In order to reconcile ourselves
with this luxury, which many unthinkingly
condemned, let us assist
at those <i lang="fr">jeux du roi</i>, to which all the
social notabilities were invited.</p>

<p>A week before the invitations had
been issued, it would be known in all
the workshops of Paris that a reception
was to take place at the court,
and more orders would be received
than could be executed. Tailors,
dressmakers, embroiderers, <em>modistes</em>,
hair-dressers, jewellers, etc., all rejoiced;
and the happiness of the invited
guest, who repaired to the <i lang="fr">fête</i> in a
showy equipage, was shared by the
workman who saw him pass.</p>

<p>Let us hasten to follow the line of
those thousand carriages which advance
in order towards the Tuileries
some time before the hour indicated
by the card of invitation; for here it
is quite different from those balls of
society where the fashion is to arrive
late in order to produce a sensation;
on the contrary, every one desires
to be among the first to obtain a
glance from the king. Already
crowds are pressing into these vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
drawing-rooms, where innumerable
wax candles shed so favorable a light
over the beauty of the women and
their superb dresses. It is impossible
to imagine, without having seen
it, the magnificent spectacle presented
by the throne-room and the Gallery
of Diana; on entering these, the
dazzling <em>ensemble</em> could be taken in
at a glance, and each one stops for a
moment, lost in admiration, to contemplate
it.</p>

<p>Here are assembled the late
minister, thinking how he may seize
again the reins of power; the present
minister, absorbed in the fear of losing
them; and the future minister,
musing over the chances he may
possess of obtaining them. All three
salute each other, press each other's
hands affectionately: one might mistake
them for friends. Here are
grouped peers of France, proud of
their hereditary rights, and confident
in the stability of them, calculating
how much the son of a lord may
be worth, and by what dowry
the daughter of a banker may purchase
the title of countess and the
<i lang="fr">entrée</i> to the court. Here we behold
the former senators of Napoleon,
who have not, perhaps, renounced
their own ideas and illusions; see
beside them old generals, who, from
the epoch of the Republic down to
Charles X., have served all the different
governments. The banner has
changed, but what does that matter?
Military honor has not suffered; that
is to be placed only in courage.</p>

<p>These officers, with their large epaulettes,
appear to cast disdainful glances
on the crowd of men in blue
coats, the collars of which, embroidered
in <i lang="fr">fleur-de-lis</i>, designate civic
functions. The supporters of the
ministry are surprised that so many
members of the opposition should
have been invited; the latter complain
that there are so few of their
own party present compared with the
number of their adversaries. There
is, however, for the time being, neither
Right side, Left side, nor Centre&mdash;all
appear harmonious; and should a
vote now be taken, the urn would be
filled with white balls, so great in
those days was the influence of an
invitation from the king&mdash;almost
equal to that of a ministerial dinner
at the present time.</p>

<p>But to the hum of conversation
suddenly succeeds a profound silence;
the king appears, followed by all the
royal family. He circulates slowly
through the apartments, and his
kindness of heart suggests to him
what to say, so as to please each one
in turn. None are forgotten; and in
addressing himself to the ladies, he
perfectly understands the art of complimenting
so as to flatter without
embarrassing them. I must not
omit, in my description of these brilliant
assemblies, to speak of the
members of the diplomatic corps,
the richness and variety of whose
costumes enhanced the magnificence
of the scene; nor can I conclude
without some mention of the courtiers
of Charles X. I know it is a
usual thing on the stage, and perhaps
elsewhere, to depict a gentleman of
the court as a low-minded, grasping,
insolent imbecile. Those who
view them all in this light resemble
the traveller who, passing rapidly
through a town, and seeing at a
window a woman with red hair,
came to the conclusion, and wrote,
that all the women of the place were
red-haired.</p>

<p>The gentleman of the court, such
as I have usually known him, since
the Restoration, is proud of his birth
and of his name; but he knows that
he has no more reason to pride himself
upon their possession than a
singer has to boast of the voice with
which nature has gifted him, or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
rich man of the fortune left him by
his father. Devoted to the king, he
does not consider himself the humble
servant of the ministers; and when
his conscience prescribes it, he places
himself in the ranks of the opposition.
He is extremely polite, knowing that
this is the surest means of securing
the recognition of his social superiority.
He does justice to merit, and
admires it frankly and without envy;
but should this merit exist in a man
of equal rank with himself, he would
be tempted to dispute it. He is
generous, for he knows that generosity
is a great and noble virtue; and
even should it not be a pleasure, it
is a duty, for him to exercise it.
Without being learned, he is not ignorant
of any of the sciences, and he
has a tact which enables him to appear
a connoisseur in art even when
such is not the case; but he no
longer takes upon himself to be
the protector of artists; he is their
friend. He understands that the empire
of the white plume and of the
red heel is at an end, and that, in
order to be respected, he must deserve
to be so.</p>

<p>Finally, his morals are good, and
this is, perhaps, the greatest change
effected by the revolution.</p>

<p>Such, as a general rule, were the
courtiers of my time, and amongst
them were men full of talent, courage,
and energy, sincerely devoted
to the true interests of the people,
who hated without knowing them;
men of noble and loyal souls, filled
with devotion to their country, and
possessed of that strong, real, and
passionate eloquence which astonishes,
moves, and persuades those who
are resolved to oppose them; men, in
short, who, finding it impossible to
do the good they desire, and unwilling
to participate in the evil which
may be done, retire into private life,
carrying with them the regrets and
the admiration of their fellow-citizens.
I do not need to name them. The
days devoted to <i lang="fr">jeux du roi</i> were
not the only ones on which persons
of various stations were invited to
the court. The birthday of the
king was the <i lang="fr">fête</i> of the people; on
that day, every cottage was made
happy, every family was supplied
with bread. But as this <i lang="fr">fête</i> was not
celebrated in the year of grace 1830,
I will speak only of New Year's day,
on which, according to custom, all
the different state corporations come
to renew to their sovereign, whoever
he may be, their pledges of fidelity
and attachment, to pay their homage
and proffer their good wishes.
To these uniform speeches, prescribed
by etiquette, expressive of sentiments
more or less real, and couched in
phrases more or less high-sounding,
according to the taste or ability of
the orator, Charles X. had the
faculty of returning answers marked
by kindness and good sense, rendered
with a grace and facility of execution
which no one has ever thought
of disputing.</p>

<p>The custom which obliged the
king to dine in public on New Year's
day was not an unpleasant one to
Charles X. He had no reason to
fear that he might be compared to
those Oriental monarchs who, when
they have dined well themselves,
think that none of their subjects
ought to feel hungry. He knew that
the wish of Henri IV. had been realized,
and that the chicken in the pot
was wanting neither to the industrious
artisan nor to the hard-working laborers.</p>

<p>If, however, these state dinners
were not destitute of charm for him,
how much more did he enjoy that
family reunion on the <i lang="fr">jour des rois</i>,
which, with its simple pleasures, is an
inheritance of past generations! The
customs attending this festival, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
which royalty is freed from all
cares or regrets, are of long standing.
The ancients, when they desired
to render a feast an especially
gay one, always appointed a
king, who was elected for the time.
Neither is the use of beans, as a distinctive
mark of power, a modern
idea. The Greeks employed them in
the nomination of their magistrates;
and when Pythagoras told his disciples
to <em>abstain from beans</em>, he gave
them a wise counsel, of which every
one does not comprehend the enigmatical
and mysterious meaning.</p>

<p>Amongst us, however, the bean is
attended by none of the dangers
dreaded by Pythagoras. How happy
is the king of the bean! He has
neither courtiers who flatter him nor
ministers who betray him; his subjects
are his friends; he chooses his
queen without regard to political considerations;
he eats, he drinks, and,
fortunate man, his reign is but for a
moment!</p>

<p>The delights of this passing royalty
were never more keenly experienced
than at the Tuileries on the 6th of
January, 1830. All appeared prosperous
in the kingdom, and the descendants
of Henri IV., assembled at
a family dinner, were united in opinion
and in affection. It was a <i lang="fr">fête</i>
day for all, and especially for the
children, who rejoiced at the unwonted
freedom from the restraints
of etiquette. Around the royal table
were seated, first the august old man,
whose goodness of heart ever shone
through the dignity of his character.
On one side of him was placed the
Duchess of Orléans, the happy mother
of a numerous and handsome family;
on the other the dauphiness, who
endeavored to console herself for the
want of the same happiness by adopting
all the unfortunate&mdash;a woman
sublime in misfortune, heroic in danger,
and who, passing through every
stage of affliction, at length reached
that height of virtue before which all
human glory must bow. Beside her
was the Duc d'Orléans,<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> who, when
exiled in foreign lands at the same
period with Charles X., had given
proofs of fidelity, affection, and devotion;
he had shared the same trials,
and conceived the same hopes. Then
came the Duchess de Berri, handsome,
happy, proud of her son, imparting
gaiety and vivacity to all around her,
little dreaming of the future which
awaited her, and certainly very far
from imagining that, ere long, the
poor and afflicted of her asylum at
Poissy would be obliged to petition
for the charity of the public. We
must not forget to mention, in this
family group, the dauphin, Mlle.
d'Orléans, the Ducs de Chartres, de
Nemours, d'Aumale, the Prince de
Joinville, the two young and pretty
Princesses of Orléans. The Duc de
Bourbon is not able to be present;
his infirmities confine him to his château
of Saint-Leu, where he had, at
least, expected to die in peace. But
let us reserve our attention for this
child who is about to play so important
a part among the guests.</p>

<p>By this time, the first two courses
have exhausted the patience of these
young hearts, but respect restrains
any expression of this feeling in them.
At length, however, the wished-for
moment has arrived, and all eyes are
turned towards an officer of the table,
who carries on a silver salver, covered
with a napkin, fifteen cakes, one of
which contains the coveted bean. It
falls to the lot of the Duc d'Aumale,
as being the youngest, to distribute
them among the guests, taking care
to keep one for himself. Each one
makes haste to ascertain his fate, and
exclamations of disappointed ambition
are heard on all sides. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
child alone blushes and is silent; not
that he is embarrassed by the rank
about to devolve upon him, but he
does not wish to mortify his competitors
by giving vent to his innocent
delight. His new majesty cannot,
however, long remain incognito, and
the Duc de Bordeaux is proclaimed
king of the bean by universal acclamation.
Then, following the example
of their new sovereign, the children
all give way to an extreme of
gaiety, which the king encourages
and partakes, and which the dauphiness
does not seek to restrain. Soon
the choice of the queen is made; it
is the Duchess of Orléans, who willingly
lends herself to receive an
honor which, perhaps, she might not
have coveted; and the dinner is concluded
amidst shouts of laughter and
cries of <em>The king drinks! The queen
drinks!</em> frequently re-echoed.</p>

<p>The august personages seated
around the royal table are not the
only ones who share the cakes of the
king. Pieces of these cakes are profusely
distributed throughout France.
Poets, authors, artists, actors, artisans,
old and infirm servants of the
Republic and of the Empire, destitute
widows and orphans partake of the
cake of the king and the bounty of
Charles X. on this occasion.</p>

<p>But the time has come to rise from
table, and Charles X. requests a moment
of silence, which he succeeds
with difficulty in obtaining.</p>

<p>"Sire," he says to his grandson,
"your reign will be at an end in
about five minutes; has your majesty
no orders to give me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, grandpapa. I wish...."</p>

<p>"You wish! Take care; in France
the king always says <em>we wish</em>."</p>

<p>"Well, then, we wish that our
governor would advance us three
months of our allowance."</p>

<p>"What will you do with so much
money?"</p>

<p>"Grandpapa, the mother of a brave
soldier of your guard has had her
cottage burned down, and this will
not be too much to build it up
again...."</p>

<p>"Very well. I will undertake
it...."</p>

<p>"No, grandpapa; because, if you
do it, it will not be I."</p>

<p>"And how will you do without
money for three months?"</p>

<p>"I shall try to gain some by the
good marks I get from my teachers,
and for which you always pay
me."</p>

<p>"Ah! you depend upon that?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; for I must dress my
poor people. I have my poor people,
like you, like mamma, like my
aunt.... Oh! I have made my
calculations, and I am quite satisfied.
When I shall have given ten francs
to the poor woman in the Bois de
Boulogne, who has a sick child, I
shall still have twenty sous left for the
prince."</p>

<p>At these words Charles X. tenderly
embraced his grandson, and
exclaimed, "Happy France, if ever
he should be king!"</p>

<h3>THE FUR TRADER.<br />

A TALE OF THE NORTHWEST.</h3>


<p>Few men are now living who remember
Montreal as it was in the
beginning of this century, when the
Northwest Fur Company had reached
the summit of its prosperity, and
the Frobishers, McGillivrays, McTavishes,
and McKenzies, with a
host of their associates, were "names
to conjure withal"; so potent had they
been made by a long and uninterrupted
series of successful adventures
in the fur trade of the northwestern
wilds.</p>

<p>The princely hospitality exercised
by the partners in their Montreal
homes, and the fitful deeds of profuse
generosity with which they delighted
to surprise the people on both sides
of the border, served to spread their
fame far and wide, and to keep their
"memory green" by many a sequestered
hearthstone long after the
Northwest Fur Company had ceased
to exist, and its members had all passed
away.</p>

<p>For many years the fireside legends
of rural hamlets on the frontier were
made up in a great measure from
narratives of startling adventures,
hazards, fatigues, and privations encountered
by the clerks, agents, <i lang="fr">voyageurs</i>,
and <i lang="fr">coureurs des bois</i> employed
by this most energetic and enterprising,
if at the same time most unscrupulous,
corporation. Its schemes
were devised with masterly skill, and
executed with reckless daring. Not
content to limit its transactions within
the extensive regions allotted to its
sway, it extended them north into
territories over which the Hudson's
Bay Company had long held control,
and south into a large domain belonging
to the United States, and
occupied to some extent by traders
under the protection of our government.</p>

<p>These invasions of the rights of
others brought the servants of the
company into frequent collision with
its rivals; but the men appointed to
such posts were selected from a large
band of trained and tried veterans in
the service, and the dashing promptitude
with which they met or evaded
opposition and obstacles seemed
like magic to the opposing parties of
trappers, free-traders, and half-breeds
thus encountered, and gained them
the reputation, among that superstitious
class, of being in league with
the father of all evil.</p>

<p>These collisions and outbreaks
among the disciples of Mammon, as
well as the pernicious influence gained
and exercised by them over the
savage tribes with whom they were
engaged in traffic, were the occasion
of great grief and anxiety to a widely
different class of men, who had long
occupied those territories, and braved
the difficulties, dangers, and hardships
of those bleak and desolate
regions, on a widely different errand.
Dauntless sons of Loyola, they had
steadfastly pursued their vocation,
"in journeyings often, in perils of
waters, in perils of the wilderness,
in labor and painfulness, in much
watching, in hunger and thirst, in
fastings often, in cold and nakedness,"
proving their allegiance to the
Prince of Peace and their claim to
his apostolic mission, while proclaim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>ing
the Gospel of salvation to the
native children of those boundless
deserts.</p>

<p>And so it befell that the servants
of lucre, who traversed the same districts,
at later periods, in pursuance
of their vocation, not unfrequently
took advantage of the openings thus
prepared, and pitched their outposts
side by side with the humble chapel
and lodge of the missionary. Then
the conflict between good and evil,
between avarice and generosity, selfishness
and benevolence, which had
always agitated the Old World, was
renewed in the wilderness, and carried
on as earnestly as if rival crowns
were striving for the mastery. An
unequal strife it must always prove,
so long as poor human nature prefers
to be the victim of evil rather
than the servant of virtue.</p>

<p>Many years ago&mdash;and long before
Catholic missions interested us further
than to excite a certain vague admiration
for the self-sacrificing zeal
with which they were prosecuted&mdash;we
listened to the following recital
from the lips of an old clerk of the
Northwest Company, which we repeat
as it was told to us, to set forth
some of the difficulties that encompassed
the missionaries among the
Indians of the Northwest, tending to
impede, if not frustrate, the object of
their efforts.</p>

<p>On a fine day in the month of
September, 18&mdash;, a fleet of canoes was
sweeping down one of the large rivers
which flow through the northwestern
portion of our country. They were
manned by Canadian <i lang="fr">voyageurs</i>, the
plash of whose paddles kept time
with the gay <em>chansons</em>, which were
borne in such unison upon their
blended voices as to seem, except
for the volume of sound, the utterance
of but one.</p>

<p>In the leading vessel of the little
squadron, well enveloped in the
folds of a magnificent fur mantle,
to shield from autumnal chills, which
settle early upon those regions, their
commander reclined at his ease. He
was a person of imposing presence
and stately manners, whose face,
grave and thoughtful for one from
which the flush of youth had scarcely
passed, presented that fine type of
manly beauty peculiar to the Highland
Scotch.</p>

<p>He seemed too entirely absorbed in
his own thoughts to notice the songs
of his light-hearted companions, the
merry chat with which they were interspersed,
or even the sly jokes
that, with the freedom produced
by the lawless habits of the wilderness,
were occasionally levelled at
himself and, the confidential clerk
who was his inseparable attendant.
Nor did his reflections seem to be of
an agreeable nature; for at times his
dark eye would flash fiercely, and
his brow contract to an ominous
frown, and again his countenance
would subside into its habitual and
somewhat pensive expression.</p>

<p>Twilight was closing around them
as they approached a trading-post
of the Northwest Company, which
had been recently opened near a
long-established missionary station,
the spire of whose humble chapel
was lifted above the numerous huts
that formed an Indian village of considerable
extent along the bank of
the river.</p>

<p>Here their commander ordered
them to land, and, after securing the
canoes for the night, to transfer their
cargoes to the storehouse of the company.
He directed in person the
removal of the most valuable merchandise,
and, entrusting the remainder
to the care of his clerk, proceeded
with haughty strides toward the
lodge of the resident missionary.</p>

<p>He was met at the entrance by a
reverend father in the habit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
the Society of Jesus, and saluted with
a distant politeness which quite unsettled
his accustomed expression
of composure and easy indifference.
An embarrassing silence followed his
admission within the lodge&mdash;a silence
which the good father seemed in no
haste to break&mdash;when the gentleman
began with a hesitating manner,
as if his proud spirit disdained what
he was about to say in opening the
conversation:</p>

<p>"I regret to hear, reverend father,
that we have been so unhappy as to
incur your displeasure in the course
of our transactions with the natives;
and I frankly confess that this regret
is greatly increased by our knowledge
of your influence over them,
the exercise of which we would gladly
have secured to promote the interests
of our trade."</p>

<p>"It is not a question of my displeasure,"
the priest replied sadly.
"To my Master you must answer
for the crying injustice you have practised
towards his children of the
wilderness, and for the sinful courses
into which they have been beguiled.
You have betrayed his cause with
those who trusted you on account
of the name of Christian, which you
so unworthily bear, and to him you
must answer for it. As to my influence,
it would have been easily secured,
if your dealings with these
untutored natives had been governed
by justice and integrity. But I
warn you, that unless you repent the
wrongs you have inflicted yourself,
and by the hands of your agents,
upon them, making such requital
as remains within your power, a
fearful retribution awaits you in this
world, and eternal despair in the
next. 'Vengeance is mine, saith
the Lord, and I will repay.'"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, good father; but I
think you greatly exaggerate the
wrongs of which you speak. It is
not possible for men of your calling
to estimate or understand the scope
of vast commercial enterprises and
the course of great mercantile operations.
Your imagination has
brooded over the transactions which
you so sternly condemn, until it has
given them a false magnitude. They
transpired in the ordinary course of
business, and though followed by
results which I deplore as deeply as
yourself, I do not feel disposed to
take blame to myself or our company
for them."</p>

<p>"You will not plead 'commercial
enterprise' or 'mercantile transactions'
before the bar of the great
Judge in excuse for eternal interests
which have been sacrificed to your
greed for gain; for confiding and
innocent souls that have been betrayed
and lost by your fault. Through
your iniquities and those of your
servants in dealing with these children,
once so willing to be taught
and to practise the duties of our
holy religion, they have been transformed
into demons of revenge;
and, disregarding our remonstrances,
have committed, and will continue
to commit, deeds of bloody vengeance
at which the world will stand aghast.
Alas! the world will never know the
provocations that goaded them to
madness; for who will tell the story
for the poor Indian? Merciless
slaughter and extermination is all
they have to look for at the hands
of men calling themselves Christians."</p>

<p>"Good father, your imagination
or ambition, or both, have led you
astray in these matters, and hoodwinked
your reason. You wish to
be the sole power among these people,
and are jealous of intruders who
may endanger your sway. Your
order, if it has not been greatly
belied, has more than once mistaken
worldly ambition for zeal in the service
of God."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span></p>

<p>"One would think," the priest replied,
smiling and casting his eyes
around the comfortless apartment
and its meagre furniture&mdash;"one
would think that the scattered sons
of a suppressed and persecuted order,
who must toil diligently with their
own hands to procure their sustenance,
while they break the bread
of life to these poor savages, might
have escaped such accusation, if any
servant of their Master might; but I
thank him that he thus permits our
enemies to set the seal of sacred
verity upon the bleakest altars of our
sacrifice!"</p>

<p>"All this is foreign to the purpose
of my visit. I do not wish to dispute
the glories of your exalted mission
or to interfere with its dominion,
but simply to inquire if we may not
in some way propitiate your favor in
the interests of our business. I am
a man of few words, more accustomed
to command than to entreat, and
go directly towards the object at
which I aim, instead of seeking out
crooked paths. We will furnish
money, if that will gain your patronage,
to build and decorate temples
and houses for your missions in these
deserts that shall dazzle the senses
of their savage tribes, and allure
their souls to Christianity; for a master
of the craft needs not to be told
how easily they are impressed by
external splendor. You would be wise
to accept our proposal, were it only
to promote the great ends for which
you are striving."</p>

<p>"Sell the flock to the wolf, for the
purpose of building and embellishing
the fold! But in what direction do
you wish our influence with this people
to be exercised?"</p>

<p>"To draw back to us the trade
which they withheld at first through
dislike of our agents, and are now
preparing to transfer to our rivals,
these newly established American
companies, greatly to our disadvantage.
We have incurred enormous
expense and labor to organize and
provide our trading-posts at points
accessible to them on the northern
rivers, for their convenience as well as
our own, to prevent the necessity for
frequent and tedious journeys to
Montreal; and it is unjust to deny us
the benefit of them, and transfer it to
rival associations. Then, these Americans
have interests opposed to ours
in every respect. I should think that
you, who are a Canadian citizen,
from Montreal like myself, would
naturally take our part against our
Protestant rivals."</p>

<p>"As befits my calling, I shall most
approve those who deal most justly
with my flock, of whatever name or
nation. As to religion, I greatly
fear it holds but feeble sway, by any
name, among those who are fighting
the fierce battles of Mammon! The
officers and agents of the new establishments,
like those of the Hudson's
Bay Company, have, however, given
an example, which you would do well
to follow, by treating the missionaries
and their cause with great respect,
and refraining from defrauding the
natives or seducing them into evil
practices by the unlimited sale of
liquors, by which they are changed to
demons. The persuasions and example
of your <i lang="fr">coureurs des bois</i> have
done much to demoralize the Indians;
but your own conduct has done
more, as your conscience must testify.
Though you renounced the name of
Catholic when you turned your back
upon the obligations it imposes, your
apostasy will not shield you from the
consequences of your acts."</p>

<p>The gentleman started suddenly
to his feet, as if stung by the words,
his voice trembling with agitation as
he said: "I see I but waste time and
words in this parley, since you are
resolved to magnify trifling faults<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
into enormous crimes. But remember,
should these natives persevere
in their present savage schemes, and,
from refusing to trade with us, proceed
in their senseless anger to deeds
of blood, it will be easy to fasten
the odium of instigating their crimes
upon you and your fraternity, who
have stubbornly refused our proffered
friendship."</p>

<p>As he gathered his mantle about
him to depart, the priest replied
meekly: "Your threats are vain;
we have planted the grain of mustard-seed
in these wilds, and it will
grow and flourish. It matters not
whether our hands or those of
others shall carry on the work
we have begun. Our times are
in the hands of God, and not of
men."</p>

<p>As his visitor withdrew, the reverend
father opened his Breviary, and,
pacing the apartment with measured
steps, soon forgot the griefs, annoyances,
and discouragements of his
position in the consoling occupation
of reading his Office, which
now entirely absorbed him.</p>

<p>While he was thus engaged, the
door was opened quietly, and a singular-looking
stranger entered without
hesitation or ceremony, depositing
his rifle at the door. After
peering inquisitively around the
room, and casting sundry furtive
glances towards the deeply abstracted
priest from keen, gray eyes, which
were deeply set under shaggy eyebrows,
he proceeded to divest himself
of a large package of furs and
a miscellaneous assortment of traps
that had been thrown over his
shoulder, and, taking the place lately
occupied by the lordly commander
of the post, seated himself on
one of the rude settles which served
as chairs in the simple furniture of
the lodge, with the careless ease of
one accustomed to make himself
quite at home wherever he might
chance to halt.</p>

<p>The appearance and dress of this
free-and-easy guest were so peculiar
as to merit description. He was
very tall, of lean and bony but muscular
frame. He wore a hunting-frock,
made from the dressed skin
of the antelope, and confined at the
waist by a leathern girdle buckled
firmly; from which depended, on his
right side, a sheath, into which a
large hunting-knife was thrust, and
on his left a shorter one for another
knife of smaller size, used in skinning
the animals taken. By the side of
the latter hung a powder-horn and
a large leathern pouch for other
ammunition. His nether gear was
a compromise between civilized and
savage attire, as it served the united
purposes of trowsers, leggings, and
hose, being laced on one side with
thongs of deer's tendons from the
knees to his huge feet, which were
encased in stout moccasins made of
buffalo-hide.</p>

<p>He sat very composedly, resting
his elbows on his knees and his chin
on his clasped hands in a musing
attitude, his battered, sunburnt, and
hardened face wearing an expression
curiously compounded of shrewd
intelligence, simplicity, inquisitiveness,
and good-humor, over which
a slight dash of veneration cast an
unwonted gleam of bashful timidity
as he threw occasional sidelong
glances towards the good father,
who, when he had finished his Office
and closed the Breviary, noticed the
presence of his guest for the first
time, and, approaching to greet him,
asked whom he had the pleasure to
address.</p>

<p>"Wa'al," he replied in a voice
cracked, as it were, by the northern
blasts to which he had long been
exposed, and marked by the sharp
nasal twang of his native State&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>"wa'al,
I'm Hezekiah Hulburt, at
your sarvice. I hail from Conneticut,
and follow trappin' for a livin'.
The Injins call me Big Foot, and
they've told me 'bout you and your
dewins. Though I haint no great
'pinion of 'em, wild or tame, and
don't put much faith in what they
say, I conclude, from all I've seen
and heard, that you're a preachin'
the Christian religion among 'em
under consid'able many difficulties.
An Injin needs more'n a double
load of Gospil truth to overbalance
the evil that's in him, and then's,
like's not, the fust you know, his
Christianity'll kick the beam when
opportewnity sarves. I know the
critters well; and here, a while ago
when our Methodist preachers undertook
'em, I told 'em 'twas no go,
the Christian religion wouldn't fit an
Injin no how; and they found t'was
so. Mebbe you'll come eout better;
and I guess likely you will, for you
seem to know better how to go to
work with 'em and keep the right
side on 'em, which is everything
with Injins. And then, you've got
more things to 'tract their attention,
and help to 'splain and 'spound
Scripter truths to an Injin's idees.
But this an't what brought me here
neow. I come to have a little talk
with you 'bout the doins of these
here fur companies that are kickin'
up such a shine among themselves
and the trappers. It's gittin' to be a
plaguy risky bizness to trade with
any on 'em, they're so 'tarnal jealous
of one another, and each one's so
mad if a fellow trades with any but
themselves. Nat'rally enough, I
take to my own folks, and would
ruther trade with the new company,
bein's they're Americans and my
own flesh and blood, as a body
might say. Now, in this awfully
spread-out country, for one who's
only a pilgrim and sojourner, as
'twere, like myself, and who has
nothin' but his own broad shoulders
to depend on for carrying his marchandise,
it makes a sight of odds
whether he can trade it off near by,
or has to foot it across the plains,
and as like's not clean to the big
lakes, 'fore he can onshoulder it.
I'm a man of peace, and haint no
notion of goin' in for a fight with
'em, du what they will. But they
better look out for them Injins!
These Nor'westers haint seen the
airthquake yet that's to foller that
are bizness of the Big Feather; but
when it comes, it'll shake 'em in their
shoes for all their big feelin's, and
swaller their proud and scornful
leader quicker'n a feller could wink.
I wash <em>my</em> hands of the whole consarn,
but I've hearn the rumblin' on't,
and it's a-comin' as sure's my name
is Hezekiah, if suthin' an't done, an'
pretty quick time, too! Revinge is
an Injin's religion; and be he Christian
or be he pagan, what's bred in
the bone stays long in the flesh."</p>

<p>The attention of the reverend father
was now thoroughly awakened.
He had heard from the Indians of the
friendly Big Foot and the frequent
assistance he had given to protect
them from the dishonesty of the
traders. He proceeded at once to
draw from the trapper further particulars
of an affair, the rumor of
which had reached him and been
alluded to by him in his interview
with his preceding guest, but of
which he could gain but little information
from the natives.</p>

<p>The facts communicated were, that
as soon as the new company was
formed, the Northwest traders had
scattered their spies among the Indians
to watch any symptoms of an
intention to transfer the trade, withheld
from them on account of their
dishonest conduct, into the hands of
their rivals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
These scouts had reported a general
movement of all those tribes to
whom the American stations were
accessible, indicating their intention
to unite among themselves, and open
a friendly traffic with the new traders.</p>

<p>The "Northwesters," as those connected
with the old company were
called, took the alarm at the prospect
of seeing a large and very lucrative
branch of their business pass to the
benefit of rivals, who were the more
formidable from being on their own
territory and under the protection of
the United States government.</p>

<p>Their leader in that department,
who visited the lodge of the missionary,
was a man of unlimited resources;
clever and crafty in scheming, unscrupulous
in executing his devices.
He entered without delay upon a
systematic course of harassing and
perplexing measures to clog the machinery
and impede the operations
of his competitors. There is reason
to believe he found efficient aid in
these from former partners and clerks
of the Northwest Company, who, in
accordance with the terms of agreement
between the two companies at
the time the American association
was organized, had unfortunately
been retained in its service.</p>

<p>He also enlisted a motley crew
of <i lang="fr">voyageurs</i>, <i lang="fr">coureurs des bois</i>, half-breeds,
free trappers, and renegades
from civilization, to carry out his well-concerted
plans for embarrassing the
enterprises of his rivals by land and
water, and discouraging their officers
and agents in every department. All
these designs were accomplished with
such silent adroitness as not only to
baffle detection, but to avoid awakening
any suspicion in the minds of
his victims, who found themselves
thwarted and defeated at every point
without being able to discover the
cause.</p>

<p>As part of his general policy, he
dispersed a large body of hirelings
among the tribes who had formerly
been hostile to those embraced in the
newly contemplated alliance (but
whose animosity had been quelled,
and mutual friendly relations between
the factions established, by the diligent
exertions of the missionaries),
representing to them that their ancient
enemies were about to unite, under
the approbation of the missionaries,
with the American companies, to destroy
them and take possession of
their hunting-grounds; that the missionaries
had been insincere in their
professions and instructions, aiming
only to keep them quiet until
measures were perfected for their
ruin. These emissaries were also instructed
to offer them arms and ammunition,
if they would waylay the
different parties on their course to the
American trading-posts, and prevent
their reaching them; and the highest
price for any peltries thus obtained.</p>

<p>The most considerable body of Indians,
bound for one of these posts
with a large amount of valuable furs,
was under command of the great
chief, Big Feather. Against this band
the hostile force was directed. It was
surprised, completely routed, and the
chief, with many of his followers,
killed. All the goods were conveyed
by the victors without delay to the
nearest station of the Northwest
Company.</p>

<p>Their operations were equally successful
in other quarters, and the
trade entirely secured for that season.</p>

<p>The free trapper whom the Indians
called Big Foot had held himself
neutral, but had noted, with the keen
shrewdness of his race, the course
affairs were taking, and had traced
the disturbing cause to his own satisfaction.
He exerted all his influence
to pacify the outraged Indians, so
cruelly betrayed and plundered, and
used his best efforts to convince the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
victors of the stratagems and falsehoods
by which they had been deceived.</p>

<p>Both parties listened with cool decorum
to his arguments, but would
make no reply. This silence was
deemed an ill omen by the priest
and the hunter.</p>

<p>Now, this chief, Big Feather, had
a young daughter, who was the delight
of his heart and the glory of
the whole tribe. She was beautiful,
graceful, and modest; with a quiet
stateliness of manner that distinguished
her among the daughters of her
people, and was attributed by them
to the power of the Christian faith,
which she was the first of her nation
to profess, and soon led her father
and brother also to receive.</p>

<p>She had been so unfortunate as to
captivate the unprincipled commander
of the Northwestern trading-posts,
who had used every artifice to gain
her young heart, and, it was well
known, had long sought an opportunity
to get her within his power.
On the night of the ambush and attack
by which her father lost his life,
the quarters where she was left were
also attacked, some of the women
and children cruelly massacred, but
her body and that of her nurse, or
attendant&mdash;with whom she was provided,
as daughter of the chief, according
to the custom of the natives&mdash;were
not to be found among
the slain. Her people suspected
they had been carried captive to the
headquarters of the company.</p>

<p>The trapper was convinced that
her brother, who escaped from the
fatal affray, and was now chief in the
place of his father, was preparing to
make a vigorous effort to recapture
her and avenge the death of the old
chief. It would need little persuasion
to bring all the natives friendly
to his tribe to make common cause
with him in such a conflict, and
scenes of frightful bloodshed must ensue,
the end of which could hardly
be conjectured.</p>

<p>The question discussed with painful
anxiety between the missionary
and the trapper was, whether anything
could be done to prevent this
shocking result. To this end, a
Christian brave of the village was
summoned, and the subject of their
conference explained to him.</p>

<p>"And now," said the reverend father,
"if you know of any plans of this
kind, or of any means by which their
execution can be prevented, it is your
duty, and I conjure you, to reveal
them."</p>

<p>"The voice of our father is good,"
replied the Indian with great respect,
"and, when he speaks for
the Great Spirit, his words are strong;
but would he make of his son a babbling
woman? Who drew the knife?
Was it the hand of thy children that
dug up the hatchet? And shall they
talk of peace when the blood of their
chief and his men cries to them for
vengeance. When the daughter of
our nation is seized for the wigwam
of him whose words filled the coverts
with creeping foes to drink our blood,
shall we give him our Bird of Heaven
and say 'it is well'?"</p>

<p>"But if she could be recovered
without the shedding of blood; if
a council of the Indians on both
sides could be called, that the truth
of this matter might be fully revealed
and understood, would it not be better
than useless strife? The traders
care not for your race. They care
not if you fight until there is no one
left of your tribes to tell the tale; and
will you give them that satisfaction?
They have set you against each
other. They have deceived your
brothers with lying words; and will
you crown their lies with success?
Above all, shall it be said that we
have delivered the message of peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
and the commands of the Great
Spirit to his children of the wilderness
in vain?"</p>

<p>"If he loves his children, why
did he not smite their foes? The
tongue of the pale-face is long; its
words reach afar. They are sweet
as honey, while his heart is full of
poison. His arm is strong, and the
knives in his camp are sharp. His
coverts in the wilds are many, and
past finding out. Who shall find and
bring back our daughter, if we take
not the war-path to the strong house
of the pale chief?"</p>

<p>"I'll warrant ye I will!" exclaimed
the trapper, unable to remain
silent any longer. "I haven't wandered
through this awfully mixed-up
part of God's creation, where the
woods and the waters, the mountains
and the valleys, lay round in a permiscus
jumble that'd puzzle a Philadelphy
lawyer, for these twenty
years, without sarchin' out as many
hidin'-places as there's quills on a
hedgehog. And to say that I've
sojourned all that time among Injins
of all sorts, on the freendliest tarms,
and 'thout a hard word with any on
'em, drunk or sober, heathen or
Christian, to be carcumvented by a
pesky Britisher at last, is an idee
that'd raise a Yankee's dander if anything
would. No, no! Just you
jine hands with me, and he'll find
he's no match for Injins and a Yankee,
or my name an't Hezekiah!
We'll be too much for the 'tarnal
sarpent!" And he fell into a series
of low chuckles expressive of his
foregone persuasion of victory.</p>

<p>"Enough!" said the Indian gravely.
"The ear of the young chief
shall be filled with the words of our
father and the Big Foot, and his
voice make reply." And he departed.
The missionary requested the trapper
to remain with him through
the night and until the answer of
the young chief should be made
known.</p>

<p>[The following sketch of a great Dominican saint is from the pen of a member of the same order
who escaped in an extraordinary manner from the massacre of Paris. We are pleased to learn that a
colony from the French province so auspiciously restored by F. Lacordaire is about to be established
in St. Hyacinthe, Canada.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span> C. W.]</p></div>


<p>"All the mysteries of Jesus Christ
gleam with the same brightness,"
says Bossuet; they are stamped with
the mark of that divine folly which is
the summit of wisdom, and of which
S. Paul spoke when he confessed
that he knew nothing but Jesus
Christ crucified, and wished no other
glory than his sublime ignominy.
Now, this scandal of the cross is especially
manifested in the lives of
the saints; for the saints are the most
faithful images of Jesus Christ crucified.
The world does not understand
these magnanimous souls, all of
whose desires tend to the things
above; it is offended by this scandal,
and sympathizes only with those
lives in which the mysteries of di<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>vine
love are closely concealed. It
does not understand the Gospel, and
is, as it were, blinded by these words
of Jesus Christ. "Father, I thank
thee that these things have been
concealed from the proud, and revealed
to the humble of heart."</p>

<p>"Whenever," again says Bossuet,
"we attempt to fathom the depths of
divine wisdom by our own strength, we
are lost and confounded by our pride;
whereas the humble of heart may
enter therein undisturbed." Such
are the maxims to be kept in view
whilst reading the lives of the saints,
and especially the admirable life of
S. Catharine of Ricci, wherein God
pleased to manifest to the world all
the riches and all the folly of his
love.</p>

<p>S. Catharine of Ricci was born at
Florence on the 23d of April, 1522.
On the day following, she was baptized
in the church of S. John the
Baptist, and received the name of
Lucretia Alexandrina Romola. Her
father was the head of the family of
Ricci, one of the most illustrious in
Florence, and her mother was the
last offspring of the noble house of
Ricasoli. From her earliest years
Alexandrina gave evidence of the
eminent sanctity to which God had
predestined her. When only three
years old, she began to devote herself
to prayer. She sought solitude
and silence, that she might more
freely converse with God, who wished
to draw to himself the earliest
affections of this chosen soul. When
God predestines a soul to heroic
sanctity, he generally bestows on her
many special graces, even before the
development of free will gives to
the creature the full possession of
herself. True, there are many exceptions;
God calls to himself some,
who, having allowed themselves to
be deceived by the artful smiles of
the world, bring to the foot of the
altar only the shattered fragments of
their hearts; but in general, he comes
before the dawn, knocks at the door of
the heart, and cries out, as in the Canticle:
"Open to me, my sister, my
spouse; for my head is covered with
dew, and my locks with the drops of
the night."</p>

<p>It was at once evident that Alexandrina
was not made for the empty
and turbulent pleasures of worldly life.
God could not permit so pure a chalice
to be profaned; so sweet a flower
could blossom only under the quiet
shelter of the cloister. It was in the
convent of the Benedictine nuns of
S. Peter de Monticelli that the daughter
of Pier Francesco de Ricci was
initiated into the monastic life. It
was a house of education, and Alexandrina
entered there as a pupil. The
religious, seeing the angelic piety of
the child, doubted not that she would
one day take the habit of their order.
Unfortunately, the primitive fervor,
charity, self-abnegation, and humility
ceased to dwell within these cloisters;
and Alexandrina, perceiving that she
could not there make her permanent
abode, at the age of nine years returned
to her father's house. There
she continued, as well as she could,
the customs of the convent, without
objection from her father, who, considering
them as innocent plays of a
puerile piety, allowed her full liberty
to exercise her devotions.</p>

<p>But Alexandrina had higher views.
Already had she decided, in her own
mind, to become a religious. One
day, two lay Sisters of the Monastery
of S. Vincent de Prato came to Pier
Francesco to beg alms. Alexandrina
was so edified by their piety, their
modesty and recollection, that she
decided at once that the convent of
Prato was the one to which God
called her. She acquainted her father
with her determination; but he, unwilling
to be separated from a child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
who was all his joy, replied by a
formal refusal. He knew not that
when God calls a soul to himself,
even the heart of a father must yield
to the irresistible attraction of that
love in comparison with which all
other affections, even the most holy,
are incapable of enchaining a soul
which listens to the voice of Jesus
Christ. Therefore, rather than see
his daughter wither like a plant kept
from its native soil, he permitted
Alexandrina to receive the veil in the
convent of Prato. She received the
habit of S. Dominic on Whitmonday,
May 18, 1535, having completed her
thirteenth year. She took the name
of Catharine, in memory of her mother,
who had been dead several
years. The fervor of the young novice
can be easily imagined; but
God, who had destined her to the
most sublime revelations, wished to
cast into the depth of her soul the
foundation of all solid virtue&mdash;humility;
therefore, he permitted that this
precious treasure should not be appreciated
by the community during
her year of novitiate. The supernatural
gifts which had already been
bestowed upon her rendered more
difficult the obligations of common
life. Meanwhile, she was admitted
to profession on the 24th of June,
1536. From that day the order of
S. Dominic received a new and most
pure glory. This glory had been
foretold by Savonarola, who, one day
pointing to a place in his neighborhood,
said to some religious of S.
Dominic: "There a fervent community
of pious sisters will be soon
established." As soon as the soul of
Catharine, like an altar prepared for
a long sacrifice, was consecrated by
her religious vows, Jesus Christ surrounded
her with his sweetest favors,
and illumined her with his most brilliant
lights.</p>

<p>But lest the sublimity of these
revelations might weaken the profound
humility of this soul, God permitted
that the Sisters of Prato, far
from admiring in her the wonders of
the divine operations, understood
nothing of these ecstasies, which they
attributed to the most common causes;
and, in fine, she was afflicted by two
terrible diseases, which lasted two
years, after which she was miraculously
cured by blessed Jerome Savonarola.
At this time the Sisters of
Prato began to judge more rightly
their holy companion, and her confessor
commanded her to tell him
faithfully all that God deigned to reveal
to her in these intimate communications.</p>

<p>It is here begins that wonderful
succession of extraordinary favors
bestowed on S. Catharine de Ricci.
Her life seemed one continual ecstasy;
her visions participated more
and more in the divine light; her
union with Jesus Christ, consecrated
by a nuptial love and the stigmata,
became more intimate; the report
of her sanctity spread itself abroad;
the most important personages of
Italy came to Prato to consult and
venerate the humble religious, whose
whole life is an eloquent teaching
and living representation of Jesus
Christ crucified. This part of the
saint's life contains facts of too elevated
a character to be completely
treated of in a synopsis; it is necessary
to read those chapters in which
the author has so well treated of the
most difficult questions of mystical
theology. But it is easier to follow
S. Catharine in the government of her
monastery and her salutary influence
abroad.</p>

<p>She was elected prioress in the
first month of the year 1552. Her
immediate duty was to instruct her
sisters, and to inspire them with an
appreciation of their sublime vocation.
Often she called her commu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>nity
to the chapter-room, and, addressing
to them a doctrine which
came from God himself, she taught
her spiritual daughters the way they
were to follow in order to reach the
summit of religious perfection. She
has left us an abridgment of her mystical
teaching in a letter which she
addressed to a religious. "At first,"
says she, "we must endeavor to be
disengaged from every earthly affection,
loving no creature but for
God's sake; then, advancing a degree,
we must love God, not only
from self-interest, but purely for himself
and because of his supreme
excellence.</p>

<p>"Secondly, all our thoughts,
words, and actions should tend towards
God; and by our prayers, exhortations,
and good example, we
should aim only at procuring his
glory in ourselves and in others.</p>

<p>"Thirdly, and lastly, we should
rise still higher in the fulfilment of
God's will, to such a degree as to
have no longer any desire in regard
to the misfortunes or joys which happen
to us in this miserable life.</p>

<p>"But we shall never arrive at this
height of perfection unless by a firm
and courageous denial of our own
will. To acquire such self-abnegation,
it is absolutely necessary to lay
the foundation of profound humility,
that, by a perfect knowledge of our
own misery and fragility, we may ascend
to the knowledge of the greatness
and goodness of our God."</p>

<p>It appears that the whole spiritual
doctrine of S. Catharine is contained
in these two fundamental points&mdash;self-abnegation
and humility, in order
to deserve the enjoyment of divine
contemplation: this is the true and
the only way to sanctity.</p>

<p>Although the first duty of a superior
is to guide those confided to
his care, he has, however, a more
painful task&mdash;he must govern them;
and it is here that the superior meets
the most serious obstacles in the exercise
of his charge. It is always
difficult to govern others; for government
is the application of laws
with firmness, yet without too much
severity. Now, human nature shrinks
from submission, which, nevertheless,
the superior is obliged to require,
unless he be a prevaricator; on the
other side, he must often adopt
measures of government which can
be discerned only by the most consummate
prudence and a profound
knowledge of the weakness of human
nature.</p>

<p>In a religious community the difficulty
is still greater; for the law is
supported by conscience only, and
it tends to guide those who have accepted
it to that ideal perfection in
which the soul is no longer attached
to the earth. During forty years
S. Catharine governed the convent
of Prato with a prudence, a sweetness,
and a firmness that made it the
perfect type of a religious community.
She combated most energetically all
abusive exemptions from common
life, and showed herself a faithful
guardian of holy observances. But
if she was the enemy of relaxation of
the rule, she also censured severely
the proud zeal of those souls whose
whole perfection consisted in repeating
the prayer of the Pharisee:
"O God, I thank you that I am not
as the rest of men. I fast twice a
week."</p>

<p>Under the direction of a prioress
so holy and so wise, the Sisters of
Prato walked with rapid strides in
the way of perfection; and how
could it be otherwise, when they beheld
their superioress tender towards
them as a mother, and discharging
her offices sometimes even in the
raptures produced by the divine revelations?</p>

<p>The influence of S. Catharine was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
not confined to the monastery of
Prato. God would not permit that
this community should be the only
witness of such elevated sanctity.
The religious of her order&mdash;her
brethren in S. Dominic&mdash;were the first
witnesses of the extraordinary graces
which she had received from heaven,
and, on her side, S. Catharine had
for them the greatest esteem, the
most lively affection, regarding them
as laborers chosen by God to cultivate
his choicest vineyard. Every
time the fathers came to Prato to
exercise the functions of prior, confessor,
or preacher, they seemed to
her as "so many angels descended
from heaven, whose presence alone
was sufficient to inspire the sisters
with sentiments of respect, and
whose coming was to infuse fresh
zeal for a more perfect life."</p>

<p>By degrees the influence of S. Catharine,
and the renown of her sanctity,
were spread throughout Italy.
Persons from all parts came to consult
her and beg her prayers. Joan
of Austria, Archduchess of Tuscany,
was bound to her by a tender friendship;
she went often to the convent
of Prato to confide to the holy
prioress all the vexations and sorrows
of her life. She profited so well by
the counsels of her holy friend that
she was no longer called by other
name than the good archduchess.
As if Germany envied Italy the treasure
she possessed in the monastery
of Prato, the King of Bavaria sent
his son there to convince himself of
that which the renown had spread
concerning this servant of God, and to
recommend himself and his kingdom
to her prayers. The influence of S.
Catharine in the world had been
deepest on those whom the author
of her life so justly calls her spiritual
sons: Antonio de Gondi, Philippo
Salviati, Giovanni-Batisti de Servi,
Lorenzo Strozzi, and many others.</p>

<p>The first and most celebrated of
all was of the illustrious house of
Gondi. A branch of this family established
itself in France at the
commencement of the XVIth century,
and from it descended the famous
Cardinal de Retz.</p>

<p>The author, in devoting a short
and interesting biography to some
of the spiritual sons of S. Catharine,
shows us what salutary influence she
exercised over the chief persons of
her country, and to what degree
of eminent sanctity she conducted
those souls who sought her direction.
Faithful to all the suggestions of
gratitude, she did not forget that the
great Apostle of Tuscany had prophesied
the glory of the monastery
of Prato, and that twice she had
been cured by his supernatural intervention;
therefore, she forwarded
in every way devotion to Savonarola.
She charged Brother Nicholas Fabiani
to revise the writings of that celebrated
Dominican, and she addressed
herself to Count Luis Capponi to
procure a beautiful portrait of Savonarola.
She had for that illustrious
character the tenderness of a daughter
and the admiration which a great
life inspires in a soul capable of comprehending
it.</p>

<p>The last years of the life of S.
Catharine was a union the most
intimate with God, a continual
succession of ecstasies; her body
was on earth, but her soul was in
heaven.</p>

<p>Towards the month of January,
she fell sick, and died on Friday,
the 2d of February, in the same
year. Numerous miracles attested the
eminent sanctity of her life. She
was beatified by Pope Clement
XII. on the 30th of April, 1732,
and was canonized by Benedict XIV.
on the 20th of June, 1746.</p>

<p>This is an incomplete synopsis of
the two volumes published by R.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
P. Bayonne. This work, destined to
make known one of the greatest glories
of the order, recommends itself
to us by the grandeur of the subject
itself, and unites a solid doctrine to
a brilliant style, and all the charms
of a perfect narration. We hope it
will soon be translated into English,
that the American public may become
more fully acquainted with a book
which takes an honorable place in
modern literature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catholicity and Pantheism&mdash;All
Truth or No Truth.</span> An Essay by
the Rev. J. De Concilio, etc., etc. New
York: Sadliers. 1874.</p></div>

<p>This essay was first published in <span class="smcap">The
Catholic World</span>, and we are glad to
see it published in a separate volume.
It is not a complete treatise, but only one
complete part of a treatise, the <i lang="la">prima
primæ</i> of a more extensive work, which
we hope the author may be able to write
and publish. F. De Concilio is one of
our most learned and acute philosophers
and theologians, a disciple of no modern
clique or innovating system, a vender of
no patent contrivance of his own for reconciling
contraries, but a modest yet
intrepid advocate and defender of the old
time honored scholastic wisdom of S.
Thomas. In its own line, his essay is
superior to anything ever before produced
in this country, and we trust that due
attention and a just meed of praise will
be awarded to it by the few who will be
able to understand it, in Europe as well
as in America. If the author, who has
for a long time struggled to bring his
work into the light, is left in the lurch by
everybody, as the learned Dr. Smith has
been in England with his splendid unfinished
work on the Pentateuch, it will
be a sad proof of our intellectual degeneracy.</p>

<p>We will not make a critical review of
F. De Concilio's argument in the present
short notice, but we think a few words
in reply to some criticisms which have
been made, and may be repeated, either
publicly or in private, are almost imperatively
called for.</p>

<p>The only one of these criticisms really
worth any attention relates to the argument
from reason for the Trinity. It has
been objected by some very respectable
theologians that the rational argument
for the Trinity professes to demonstrate
from purely rational principles of natural
human intelligence the entire revealed
mystery of the Trinity. We admit frankly
that, if the supposition is correct, the
censure founded on it, that the author
has undertaken something pronounced
by Catholic doctrine impossible and unlawful,
is just and inevitable. We have
never, however, understood the author
in this sense. We understand him to
profess to argue in part from premises
given by revelation, and thus merely to
explicate a theological doctrine, and in
part to furnish proofs from pure reason,
first, that the rational objections against
the dogma are invalid; and, second, that
the dogma as disclosed by revelation
taken as a philosophical hypothesis, and
it alone, satisfactorily solves certain difficult
problems respecting the divine nature,
which otherwise would be insoluble.
So far as any direct proof of the distinction
and proprieties of the three persons
in God is concerned, we understand that
such proof is put forward as inadequate
and only probable, but by no means
either a complete or strictly demonstrative
argument.</p>

<p>We think, therefore, with due submission
to higher authority, that the author
escapes the censures of the Syllabus and
the Vatican Council, and attempts no
more than has been done by Bossuet,
Lacordaire, and other great thinkers,
who have never been thought to have
gone beyond the bounds of allowed liberty.
We leave the author, however,
to defend and advocate his own cause,
if it requires to be further vindicated, and
merely give this statement as an explanation
of our own reason for admitting
his admirable articles into this magazine
without any alteration.</p>

<p>Another criticism, which the author
himself has sufficiently answered, imputed
to him the doctrine of a necessary
creation and of <em>optimism</em>. It is only
necessary to read his book carefully to
see how unfounded is this imputation.</p>

<p>Still more futile is an objection, urged
by the author of the criticism just now
noticed, that F. De Concilio's opinion
of the precedence of the decree of the incarnation
to the decree of the redemption
of fallen man is contrary to the opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
of S. Thomas and the <em>schola</em> generally.
Be it so! But what then? Must we
follow the common opinion, or that which
is extrinsically more probable, if the contrary
opinion has a real intrinsic and
extrinsic probability? <i lang="la">Minime gentium!</i>
F. De Concilio but follows S. Athanasius,
Suarez, and other authors whose works
have passed the Roman censorship,
against S. Thomas; and he gives good
intrinsic reasons for doing so. Let any
one who wishes to attack him do so by
refuting his arguments; but it is most
untheological to find fault with his opinion
as any less sound and orthodox than
the contrary. Let us be rigorous in censuring
opinions which are really unsound
and untenable, but let us beware of that
carping and unfriendly spirit which has
always been the bane of theological discussions,
and which throws out the imputation
of unsoundness without a certain
and sufficient warrant of authority.
We do not concur in all the opinions
which are held in the school which F.
De Concilio follows, and which must inevitably
come out with greater distinctness
in the second part of his essay; but we
shall look forward with pleasure to see
him develop and defend them with his
usual masterly ability, and we express
our great desire that he should write as
much as his pastoral duties will permit
on philosophical and theological topics.</p>

<p>It is beyond question among learned
and devout Catholics that many saints
and pious servants of God in all ages
have received private revelations in which
are contained predictions of events in a
near or remote future time to the recipients
of this supernatural light. It is,
moreover, certain that a number of supernatural
and miraculous events of a
most extraordinary character, and evidently
intended as warnings to the
good as well as to the wicked, and some
very credible revelations respecting great
judgments and great mercies of God which
are impending, have occurred in our own
time. It must be, therefore, not only interesting,
but useful, to have authentic
and judicious accounts of grave and sacred
matters of this kind published and
circulated among the faithful. A collection
of this sort has been published in
France by a learned priest, the Abbé
Curicque, with the approbation of several
bishops, entitled <cite>Voix Prophétiques</cite>; and
several other critical and judicious writers
in Europe have published books or
articles relating to different persons and
events of this extraordinary class, which
are truly valuable, instructive, and edifying.
The end and object of the compiler
of the book before us is, therefore,
one which we must approve, although we
are sorry not to be able to give an unqualified
commendation to the manner in
which he has executed his task. That
he is a very pious and zealous priest is
evident at first sight. That he has laid
down in general terms the sound theological
doctrine about the credibility of
private revelations, and made some very
just reflections and timely exhortations
about the times in which we live, and
the sentiments we ought to cherish and
put in practice in view of the certain approach
of the consummation of this
world, is also obvious to any reader of
his book. The research and painstaking
which he has used in collecting his materials
are very great, and the greatest
part of them are undoubtedly derived
from respectable and trustworthy sources
of information, and therefore entitled to
credit.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as a whole, the compilation
lacks the sobriety, discretion, and
authority which a book of this kind
ought to have, in order to give it proper
credibility and weight with the general
class of readers, who cannot judge for
themselves or discriminate properly, and
who need, therefore, that evidence should
be given them by reference to standard
authorities, and by the guarantee of
names which are known to them and
sufficient to warrant their belief in the
genuineness and credibility of such remarkable
documents as those contained
in this compilation. An anonymous author,
whose work appears without any
ecclesiastical approbation or recommendation
of persons known to the Catholic
public, is entitled to no credit on his
own mere assertion. He must cite his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
authorities and witnesses, and must exact
no assent without giving a sufficient
motive. A translation of the work of
the Abbé Curicque would, in our opinion,
have been much more likely to accomplish
the end of the pious author
than a compilation like the one he has
made. Moreover, there are some things
in this book, and these the very matters
which make the most exorbitant demand
on the credulity of the reader, for which
no evidence whatever is furnished but
the <i lang="fr">on dit</i> of certain unknown parties.
Other things are very doubtful; some are
contradictory to one another. The author
mixes up with the citations he makes
his own favorite view of the course of
present and coming events, especially
about the schism and the anti-popes,
whose coming he forebodes; and a haze
of the visionary, the wondrous, and the
improbable is thus thrown over the
whole, which envelopes even that which
is really entitled to credence and pious
veneration, and tends to bring the whole
into suspicion and discredit. The hint
thrown out that a certain cardinal, whose
name might as well have been given,
since every one will know who is meant,
may become an anti-pope, is contrary to
Christian charity and prudence; and, in
general, we must notice with regret that
the author's zeal is sadly lacking in
discretion, and devoid of that delicate
tact and discernment, more necessary in
one who handles such difficult and perilous
themes than in any other sort of
writer or teacher of the people.</p>

<p>It is not the fault of the author, who is
a foreigner, that he has fallen into many
inaccuracies of language; but we think
the publisher might have secured a revision
of the text by some competent
person, and that it would have been in
better taste, as well as more befitting the
reserve and sobriety due to matters which
are so very serious, if he had made a less
sensational announcement of the book.
It is, however, notwithstanding these
drawbacks, certainly a very curious collection
of documents and pieces of information
which are interesting to know
about, and contains so much that is truly
valuable and edifying that we hope it
will not only gratify curiosity, but also
do good to a great many of its readers,
by turning their attention to the great
subjects which it presents in such vivid
colors, and in a startling proximity to the
present and coming events of our own age.</p>

<p>In order to assist those of our readers
who may wish to have some direction to
guide them in perusing this book with
discrimination and understanding, we
will specify in part which are the most
valuable and trustworthy portions, which
are less so, and which are altogether
without sufficient grounds of probability
to entitle them to any regard.</p>

<p>First, there are the prophecies of canonized
or beatified saints, whose authenticity
is well established and their interpretation
more or less clear. These are the
prophecies of S. Remigius, S. Cesarius, S.
Edward, S. John of the Cross, and the B.
Andrew Bobola, S.J. In regard to those
of S. Bridget of Sweden and S. Francis
of Paul, they would be entitled to equal
respect, if clearer evidence were furnished
of their authenticity than that given by
the author&mdash;a matter in regard to which
we are not able to pronounce any judgment.
The prophecy of S. Malachy is one
in respect to which there is great difference
of opinion. We give our own for
what it is worth, after some reading on
the subject, in its favor. After these
come the prophecies of persons of recognized
sanctity, which have gained credit
with judicious and well-informed persons
competent to form an enlightened opinion.
The most valuable and trustworthy
of these are from the V. Holzhauser, the
V. Anna Maria Taigi, the V. Curé of
Ars, F. Necktou, S.J., Jane le Royer,
Sœur de la Nativité, and Mary Lataste.
The prophecies of the Solitary of Orval
and of the Nun of Blois have their warm
partisans and opponents, the Abbé Curicque
being among their defenders. The
Signora Palma d'Orio is a person whose
ecstatic state seems to be beyond reasonable
doubt, yet it is difficult to ascertain
with certainty what she has really predicted;
so that what is reported from her, although
interesting, is scarcely to be considered
as having evidence enough to be
classed among authentic predictions. The
revelations made to Maximin and Melanie
appear to us to belong to a similar
category, as worthy of the greatest respect
in themselves if we had an ample
guarantee of their genuineness and authenticity,
but as not yet placed in a sufficiently
clear light to warrant a prudent
assent. The remainder of the contents
we pass over without any special remark,
with the exception of those few matters
which we have noted above as making an
exorbitant demand on the reader's credu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>lity
without any evidence to warrant it.
One of these points is the story of David
Lazzaretti, another about Zoe Tonari,
"destined soon to be a second Joan of
Arc," and the most censurable of all
is what is said about Antichrist having
been born in 1860, and other things connected
with the same. (Pp. 265-268.)</p>

<p>In connection with the wonderful narrative
of David Lazzaretti the author has
woven a very flimsy texture of conjectures
out of the materials furnished by
some of the curious documents which he
cites for his hypothesis of a schism and
two anti-popes to come immediately after
the death of Pius IX. It is with regret
that we are compelled to touch on these
subjects in such a superficial manner;
they require careful handling. Excessive
and imprudent credulity in those who
have faith and piety is certainly unreasonable,
and may be blamable and hurtful.</p>

<p>But the utter incredulity and dogged
refusal to admit anything miraculous and
supernatural which is exhibited by our
modern illuminati is the very <i lang="fr">ne plus ultra</i>
of unreason, and the acme of wilful, despicable,
and wicked folly. The most sensible,
as well as the most pious rule is, to
follow the church without reservation in
all that she teaches and sanctions, and in
those things concerning which she is
silent to follow her saints and doctors,
who are the most enlightened of all men.</p>

<p>This timely and clearly-written plea for
Don Carlos places beyond a question his
right to the Spanish throne. The Bourbons
succeeded to the Spanish throne
through the marriage of Louis XIV. with
the Infanta of Spain, eldest daughter of
Philip IV. Her grandson, Philip V., became
king on the failure of direct issue
from his grand-uncle, Charles II., the son
of Philip IV. The Salic law, confirming
the succession to the heirs male of the
royal house, was established by Philip V.
and his cortes, with the consent of all the
great powers, in order to prevent the
union of the French and Spanish crowns,
the King of Spain relinquishing all his
rights as a French prince. This law has
never been validly repealed. Christina
of Naples, the queen of Ferdinand VII.,
a most ambitious and unprincipled princess,
had this law violently and illegally
set aside in order to make way for her
daughter Isabella to ascend the throne.
The base and illegal nature of the intrigues
by which Don Carlos and his
family were exiled from Spain and deprived
of their just rights is fully exposed
by Gen. Kirkpatrick. Charles V., the
brother of Ferdinand VII., was succeeded
in his claim to the throne by his son,
Charles VI., in 1845, who, dying in 1861
without issue, was succeeded by his brother,
Don Juan, who abdicated October,
1868, in favor of his son, the present Don
Carlos, who is now twenty-five years of
age, and married to the niece of the Comte
de Chambord. Charles V. would undoubtedly
have succeeded in regaining
his throne but for the shameful interference
of Louis Philippe of France, and the
English crown. The party of Christina
was composed of all the liberals, communists,
and enemies of the church, and
Isabella was merely tolerated by the
sound and Catholic majority of the nation
from necessity.</p>

<p>The clergy, the ancient nobility, the
peasantry, and most of the friends of order
and religion in all classes, desire the restoration
of Don Carlos to the throne,
which belongs to him by the laws of the
Spanish constitution. It is very true that
a mere restitution of legitimate monarchy
is not a certain guarantee for good government,
and that many of the Bourbons
have been bad rulers. It is, nevertheless,
the only hope for Spain; and the character
and principles of Don Carlos give reason
to hope that, taught by adversity and
trained by experience to value the sound
Catholic traditions of Spain, he will prove
to be a good sovereign. We wish him,
therefore, most cordially, a speedy and
complete triumph, which we believe he is
in the way to win.</p>

of the famous cardinal's <cite>Essays</cite>. The
Catholic reader is under great obligations
to Mr. O'Shea for the reprint of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
these splendid compositions, the London
edition being out of print. It is to be
regretted, however, that the references
adapted to that edition should not have
been changed to suit the present issue.
Having indicated one fault, we might as
well inquire of the publisher why he
<em>will</em> use perfumed paper in his books?
Though not a serious objection, it is an
annoying one to reasonably fastidious
readers, as we happen to know.</p>

<p>Vol. V. opens with an article on Spain,
which takes up more than half the book.
It is superfluous to remark that this essay
is of peculiar interest at the present hour.
Next we have a vindication of Pope Boniface
VIII.&mdash;a very important subject.
Then a review of Montalembert's <cite>S.
Elizabeth of Hungary</cite>. The three remaining
articles are specimens of the
writer's scholarship as an antiquarian.
Vol. VI. contains ten essays. The first
treats learnedly of S. Peter's chair at
Rome. A plate accompanies the article.
The fifth administers flagellation to
Charles Dickens for certain things in
his <cite>American Notes</cite>; and also to Mrs.
Trollope, for her <cite>Visit to Italy</cite>. Then
follow four other essays on the subject
of Italy: "Italian Guides and Tourists,"
"Religion in Italy," "Italian Gesticulation,"
and "Early Italian Academies."
The volume concludes with "Sense <em>vs.</em>
Science."</p>

<p>We are reminded, while noticing the
completion of this work, of an article on
the Donatist schism, "Catholic and Anglican
Churches" (p. 199, v. iii.), which "caused
in no slight degree" the doubt which
first crossed the mind of Dr. John Henry
Newman "of the tenableness of the theological
theory on which Anglicanism is
based," and which we cannot, therefore,
do better than commend to the serious
attention of all honest and conscientious
Episcopalians.</p>

<p>We cordially recommend this excellent
and beautifully printed manual to all those
for whom the title states it has been prepared
by its learned author. It will be a
favorite, especially with young people
and children, whether used as a class or a
reading book, particularly on account of
its pictures, which are generally good, and
many of which are remarkably fine. Such
a book, which, so far as we know, is
much the best of the kind, must do incalculable
good; and we hope it will be
appreciated by parents and teachers, so
as to find its way into every family and
school throughout our country and elsewhere,
wherever Catholics are found who
use the English language. The author
has done well by taking into account
those generally received facts and hypotheses
of natural science which have a
bearing on topics handled, in their connection
with the facts and truths of revelation,
by the sacred writers. His statement,
however, that the surface of the
earth bears on it the marks of perturbations
caused by the Deluge, and otherwise
not capable of scientific explanation, is
not one which geologists would admit,
and we doubt very much its correctness.</p>

<p>On page 16 the author observes that,
"as the divinity of Christ was doubted
before the Council of Nice, so these [deutero-canonical]
books and passages might
have been doubted before the decision of
the church."</p>

<p>The cases are not parallel. The divinity
of Christ was an article of faith
before the definition of the Council of
Nice, and no good Catholic could doubt
it. But the canonical authority of certain
books was not an article of faith before it
was defined, and might have been, as it
indeed was, doubted by good Catholics.</p>

<p>We think the author would improve
his work by inserting a good, succinct
historical account of the events which occurred
between the period of the Books
of the Machabees and that of the Evangelists.
Moreover, we do not like the
termination "eth" in the index, which is
unnecessarily quaint and old-fashioned,
or approve all the rhymes which precede
the chapters, although some of them are
not without a quaint poetic vigor, and
most of them are terse and ingenious,
likely, therefore, to strike the fancy and
stick in the memory of children.</p>

<p>It is seldom that we take the trouble to
make so many criticisms on a book. This
one, however, is so good and so very important
that we would like to see the author
continue to improve it in every new
edition, and therefore offer our sugges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>tions
in the most kindly and respectful
spirit to the reverend and learned author,
adding to what we have already said in
commendation of the <cite>Bible History</cite> that it
is not merely a good school-book, but a
work of really sound and solid scholarship.
We are very glad to see that the author
has sought and obtained the approbation
of the ecclesiastical authority before
publishing his work, and we trust that his
good example will be generally followed,
and, moreover, that the law of the church
will be enforced in every diocese and in
all cases, requiring this approbation for
all books treating <i lang="la">de rebus sacris</i>.</p>

<p>The season does not bring a brighter,
pleasanter, or more useful and necessary
book than this cleverly executed little
work. From cover to cover the reader
finds something to catch the eye and attract
him in every page. For a wonder,
the title is an exact index of the book; it
is illustrated, and remarkably well illustrated;
it is Catholic, and it is a <em>family</em>
almanac, which the children will pore
over for hours, delighted with the pictures
of famous Catholic men, women, and
places, and the short but well-written
sketches accompanying them; which their
parents will consult in order to find all
the information concerning feasts, fasts,
and the like necessary for the coming
year; which all will read who wish to obtain
accurate information on matters relating
to the spread and progress of the
church, particularly in the United States.
When this has been said, there is really
nothing more to say, as far as recommending
this almanac to Catholics goes;
but there is a great deal to be said concerning
this present number, which in
many respects is an improvement even
on its predecessors. For instance, in the
matter of filling in a page with short but
pithy notices of Catholic works, in the
excellent but necessarily incomplete tables
of statistics of the Catholic Church in
the United States, and in the fulness of
the Catholic chronology for the past year,
which forms, as it were, the headlines of
Catholic history in this country&mdash;all this
displays enterprise, and the excellence of
the whole speaks tact and care on the part
of the editor.</p>

<p>Glancing at the illustrations, we find
portraits and sketches of Abp. Odin;
Rt. Rev. Michael O'Connor, first bishop
of Pittsburgh and of Erie; Bishop Fitzpatrick,
of Boston; Father Southwell, S.J.,
whose poems and writings are now being
collected and given to the public; Father
Lacordaire, Father De Smet, and others.
Here is a head of Manzoni, in another
place the Comte de Montalembert; here
John Banim's well-known face looks out,
and here is genial Thomas D'Arcy McGee
smiling at us. In another place is a
portrait of S. Ignatius in armor, and a
sunny picture of his birth-place. Miss
Honora Nagle, foundress of the Ursuline
Order in Ireland, Mother Mary of the Incarnation,
Blessed Margaret Mary Alacoque,
Church of Our Lady of Lourdes,
of S. Stephen of the Mount, Abbey of
Cluny, and others, form subjects for illustrations
and sketches, all careful, accurate,
and finished. Looking again at the

<h3>THE PRINCIPLES OF REAL BEING.</h3>


<p>All knowledge which is truly scientific
rests on demonstration, and
all demonstration depends on principles
or axiomatic truths. But, besides
the principles of demonstration,
there are other principles on which
not only the knowledge, but the very
existence of things, and their origin
and constitution, essentially depend.
These latter principles are nowadays
less known than the former, as we
may argue from the fact that they
are scarcely ever alluded to in modern
speculations; and yet they undoubtedly
have the best claim to the
attention of philosophical minds, for
it is in such principles that the real
germs of all true science are hidden.
For this reason, we have determined
to offer our readers a short but accurate
summary of the philosophical
doctrine on principles; which, if presented,
as we shall try to do, with
becoming perspicuity, will prove to
be a kind of popular introduction to
metaphysical studies.</p>


<h4>I. NOTION OF PRINCIPLE.</h4>

<p>By the name of <em>principle</em> philosophers
designate that whence anything
originally proceeds in any manner
whatever: <i lang="la">Id, unde aliquid quomodocumque
procedit</i>. This definition
implies that there are many different
manners of proceeding, and consequently
many different kinds of principles.
And so it is. Aristotle, however,
shows that principles of all
kinds can be reduced to three classes;
that is, to those principles of which a
thing consists, those through which
or out of which a thing is made, and
those by which a thing is known:
<i lang="la">Primum, unde aliquid est, aut fit, aut
cognoscitur</i>.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>&mdash;Arist. <cite>Metaph.</cite> 5.</p>

<p>The first class comprises the principles
through which a thing is, viz.,
by which the thing is intrinsically constituted.
These principles are called
<em>constituent</em> or <em>intrinsic</em> principles, and
are always present <em>by their own entity</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>in the thing principiated; as the matter
in the body, and the soul in the
animal.</p>

<p>The second class contains the principles
through which a thing <em>is made</em>.
These principles serve to account for
the origin of the thing, and are called
<em>extrinsic</em> principles, because they
are not present by <em>their own entity</em> in
the thing principiated. Thus, the
motive power of the sun is not,
by its own entity, in the planets to
which it imparts movement, but in
the sun only; and the medical art is
not in the person who has been cured
through it, but in the doctor. There
is, however, in the planets something
proceeding from the motive power
of the sun, and in the person cured
something proceeding from the medical
art, as every one will acknowledge.
Whence it is obvious that
the extrinsic principles by their very
principiation must leave some mark
or vestige of themselves in the thing
principiated.</p>

<p>The third class consists of those
principles through which any conclusion
is <em>made known</em>. These principles
are general truths, which are
made to serve for the demonstration
of some other truth, and are called
principles <em>of science</em>.</p>

<p>Among the principles of this third
class we do not reckon the principles
from which the first apprehension
and immediate intuition of things
proceeds; to wit, either the power
through which the object makes an
impression on the cognoscitive faculty,
or the faculty itself through which
the object is apprehended. Our
reason is that these principles, thus
considered, do not form a class apart.
The power of the object to make
its impression on the subject is an
<em>extrinsic</em> principle of knowledge, and
ranks with the principles of the second
class above mentioned; whilst the
power of the subject to perceive
through the intelligible species is an <em>intrinsic</em>
principle of knowledge, as well
as the species which it expresses within
itself, and, therefore, is to be ranked
among the principles of the first
class. Accordingly, the third class
is exclusively made up of those principles
which serve for the scientific
demonstration of truth; and this is
what Aristotle himself insinuates, at
least negatively, as he gives no instance
of principles of this third
class but the premises by which any
conclusion is made known.</p>

<p>Before we advance further, we have
to remark that, in metaphysics, the
first principles of science are assumed,
not as a subject of investigation, but
as the fundamental base of scientific
demonstration. Thus, the principles,
<i lang="la">Idem non potest simul esse et non esse</i>,<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
<i lang="la">Non datur effectus sine causa</i>,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> <i lang="la">Quæ
sunt eadem uni tertio sunt eadem inter
se</i>,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> and such like, though usually
styled "metaphysical" principles, are
not the subject of metaphysical investigation,
but are simply presupposed
and admitted on the strength
of their immediate and incontrovertible
evidence. Such principles are
perfectly known before all metaphysical
disquisition, and need not be
traced to other principles. On the
other hand, metaphysics, which is
the science of reality, deals only with
the principles of <em>real</em> beings; whence
it follows that the principles of demonstration,
which, like the conclusion deduced
therefrom, exist in the intellect
alone (and therefore are <em>beings
of reason</em>, and principiate nothing but
other beings of reason), are not comprised
in the object of metaphysical
inquiry. Hence, the only principles
which metaphysics is bound to investigate
are those that belong to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>first and second class above mentioned;
that is, the intrinsic and the extrinsic
principles of things: <i lang="la">Primum
unde aliquid est</i>, and <i lang="la">primum unde
aliquid fit</i>.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>Principles and causes are often
confounded, although it is well
known that they are not identical.
Hence, our next question is: In what
does a cause differ from a principle?</p>

<p>It is commonly admitted that all
causes are principles, but not all
principles causes; which evidently
implies that a cause is something
more than a principle. In fact, when
we use the word "cause," we wish to
designate a being in which we know
that there is a principle of causation;
whence it is evident that the common
notion of cause implies the notion
of principle, <em>and something else
besides</em>&mdash;that is, the notion of a subject
to which the principle belongs.
Thus, we say that the moon causes
the tides by its attractive power; the
moon is the <em>cause</em>, and the attractive
power is its <em>principle</em> of causation.
In like manner, we say that an orator
causes great popular emotion by his
eloquence; the orator is the <em>cause</em>,
and his eloquence is his <em>principle</em> of
causation.</p>

<p>From these instances it would be
easy to conclude that the difference
between a cause and a principle lies
in this, that the cause is a complete
being, whilst the principle is only an
appurtenance of the cause. But as
we know from theology that there
are principles which cannot be thus
related to causes, we cannot consider
the above as an adequate and final
answer to the question proposed.</p>

<p>Some of the best modern scholastics
account for the difference between
cause and principle in the following
manner: A principle, they say, is
conceived to differ from a cause in
two things: first, in this, that a cause
always precedes its effect by priority
of nature,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> whereas a principle does
not require such a priority; secondly,
in this, that the cause does not communicate
its own identical nature to its
effect, whereas the principle can communicate
its own identical nature to
that which it principiates.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> From
these two differences a third one
might be gathered, viz., that the effect
has always a real dependence <em>from</em><a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
its cause, whilst the thing principiated
does not always really depend <em>from</em>
its principles.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> These grounds of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>distinction between principles and
causes have been thought of, with
the avowed object of paving the way
to explain how the Eternal Father
can be the principle, without being
the cause, of his Eternal Son, and
how the Father and the Son can be
the principle, without being the cause,
of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>But we must observe that there are
four genera of causes and of principles:
the <em>efficient</em>, the <em>material</em>, the
<em>formal</em>, and the <em>final</em>; and that the
two differences alleged by these writers
between principle and cause do not
apply to principles and causes of the
same genus, but are applicable only
when some principle belonging to
one genus is wrongly compared with
some cause pertaining to another
genus.</p>

<p>That there are four genera of
causes we will take for granted, as it
is the universal doctrine of philosophers.
That there are also four genera
of principles corresponding to
the four genera of causes is evident;
for every cause must contain within
itself the principle of its causality;
and, in fact, Aristotle himself clearly
affirms that there are as many causes
as principles, and that all causes are
also principles,<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> in the sense which
we have already explained. Lastly,
that the two aforesaid differences
between principle and cause do not
apply to principles and causes of the
same genus can be easily verified by
a glance at each genus. Let the
reader take notice of the following
statements, and then judge for himself.</p>

<p>The efficient cause (the agent) and
the efficient principle (its active
power) are <em>both</em>, by priority of nature,
prior to the thing produced or principiated,
and <em>both</em> have a nature numerically
distinct from that of the
thing produced or principiated.</p>

<p>In the same manner the final
cause (the object willed) and the
finalizing principle (the known goodness
and desirability of the object)
<em>both</em> are, by priority of nature, prior
to the act caused or principiated, and
<em>both</em> have a nature numerically distinct
from that of the act caused or
principiated.</p>

<p>Thus, also, the material cause (actual
matter) and the material principle
(the passiveness of matter) are
<em>both</em>, by priority of nature, prior to
the thing effected or principiated, and
<em>both</em> identify themselves with the
thing effected or principiated.</p>

<p>Accordingly, with regard to these
three kinds of causation and principiation,
it is quite impossible to admit
that the difference between a
cause and a principle is to be accounted
for by a recourse to the two
aforementioned grounds of distinction,
so long as the causes and principles,
which are compared, belong
to one and the same genus.</p>

<p>As to the formal cause and the formal
principle, we shall presently see
that they are not distinct things; but,
even if we were disposed to consider
them as distinct, such a distinction
could not possibly rest on the two
grounds of which we have been
speaking; for the formal cause and
the formal principle have no priority
of nature<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> with respect to the thing
caused or principiated, and <em>both</em> identify
themselves with the same. We
are, therefore, satisfied that the opinion
which we have criticised has no
foundation in truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us, then, resume our previous
explanation, and see how the difficulty
above proposed against its completeness
can be solved. We have
shown that the notion of cause implies
the notion of principle, together with
that of a subject to which the principle
belongs. We must, therefore, admit
that a principle differs from a
cause of the same genus, as an incomplete
or <em>metaphysical</em> entity differs
from a complete or <em>physical</em> being;
or, in other terms, that a real cause,
rigorously speaking, is a complete being,
<em>which</em> gives origin to an effect;
whilst a real principle, properly
speaking, is only that <em>through which</em>
the cause gives origin to its effect.
The cause is <i lang="la">id quod causat</i>;<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> the
principle is <i lang="la">id quo causa causat</i>.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>The formal principle, however, is
an exception to this general doctrine,
as formal principles do not differ from
formal causes. The form, in fact,
not only <em>has</em> within itself something
through which it is fit to cause its
effect, but also <em>is</em> itself that very
something, and <em>through itself</em> brings
its effect into existence. Thus the
soul, which is the form of the body,
<em>through itself</em>, and not through any
of its faculties, actuates the body and
vivifies it. On this account, then,
any form might be indifferently called
either a formal <em>cause</em> or a formal
<em>principle</em>. But we must further consider
that a form, as such, is an incomplete
entity, since no formal act
can exist apart from its essential
term;<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> and on this ground we maintain
that the name of <em>principle</em> suits
it better than the name of <em>cause</em>.</p>

<p>And this conclusion will be approved
even by those philosophers whose
opinion concerning the distinction
between cause and principle we have
just refuted; for the two differences
which they allege as characteristic of
cause in opposition to principle have
no room in formal causation or principiation,
since we have seen that the
formal act has no priority of nature
with respect to its essential term, and
identifies itself with the thing of
which it is the act. Consequently,
the form, even in the opinion of
said philosophers, is not a cause,
but a principle.</p>

<p>We hope to give a fuller explanation
of this point on a later occasion;
but what we have just said suffices to
show what we at present intend,
viz., that the doctrine which considers
principles as appurtenances of causes
admits of a remarkable exception in
the case of formal principles, and by
such an exception is competent to
account for the existence of other
principles importing real principiation
without real causation. Now, this
is exactly what the theological doctrine
on divine processions requires.
The fact, therefore, that the procession
of one of the divine Persons
from another involves no causation,
but only principiation, can be accounted
for by a simple reference
to the nature of formal principiation.
The Eternal Father is certainly not
the efficient, but the <em>formal</em>, principle
of His Eternal Son; and this already
suffices to explain how the being of
the Son is not <em>a new being made</em> by
the Father, but is the very same being
of the Father communicated
identically to the Son. Thus, also,
the Holy Ghost not efficiently, but
<em>formally</em>, proceeds from the Father
and the Son, through their conspiration
into a simple actuality of love;
and this suffices to explain how the
Holy Ghost is not <em>made</em> by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
Father and the Son, but is the very
actuality of the one in the other.</p>

<p>To sum up: Formal principiation
is not causation; hence, that which
immediately proceeds from a formal
principle is not caused by it, but
only principiated; it is not its effect,
but its connatural term; it has not a
distinct nature, but the very nature
of its formal principle identically
communicated; lastly, it has no real
dependence <em>from</em> its formal principle,
but only real relative opposition; for
real dependence has no place where
there is identity of nature. This is
eminently true of God, and, by imitation,
of every primitive contingent
being, which is strictly one in its
entity, and consequently also of all
the ultimate elements into which a
physical compound can be resolved;
for the ultimate elements of things
cannot but be primitive beings.</p>

<p>The preceding remarks regard
those formal acts which enter in the
essential constitution of being as
such, and which are called strictly
<em>substantial acts</em>. Of accidental forms
we have nothing to say in particular,
as it is too evident to need explanation
that they are not causes, but
mere principles. It is, therefore, to be
concluded that the distinction between
cause and principle applies
only to <em>efficient</em>, <em>material</em>, and <em>final</em>
causality and principiativity. Thus,
as we have said, <em>the sun</em> is the efficient
cause of certain movements,
and <em>its attractive power</em> is the efficient
principle of those movements; <em>the
object</em> is the final cause that moves
the will, and <em>the goodness</em>, through
which the object moves the will, is
the finalizing principle of the volition:
<em>the steel</em> is the material cause of the
sword, but the material principle of
the sword is <em>the passive potency</em> of the
steel, which allows it to receive the
form of a sword or any other form.</p>

<p>We must not forget, however, that
the words <em>cause</em> and <em>principle</em> have
been, and are, very frequently used
without discrimination by philosophical
writers, even of the highest
merit. It is by no means uncommon
to find, for instance, the premises
described as the <em>cause</em> of the conclusion,
the rules of the art as the <em>cause</em>
of an artificial work, the exemplar as
the <em>cause</em> of that in which it is reproduced
or imitated. In these examples,
the word <em>cause</em> stands for
<em>principle</em>. The old Greek theologians
even said that God the Father
is the <em>cause</em> of his Eternal Son; the
word <em>cause</em> being undoubtedly used
by them in the sense of <em>principle</em>.
We should not be astonished at this.
Indeed, while we ourselves persist in
giving the name of cause to the
formal principle, we should be the
last to be surprised at the Greek
fathers doing the same.</p>

<p>And now, let us come to another
part of our subject. Philosophers,
when wishing to give a full account
of things, besides principles and
causes, point out <em>metaphysical reasons</em>
too. We think it our duty to show
in what such reasons consist, and in
what they differ from principles.</p>

<p>A reason, in general, may be
defined as <em>that from which anything
immediately results</em>; and since a formal
result is not made, but simply
follows as a consequence from a
conspiration of principles, we can
see at once that a reason, or the
formal ground of a given result, must
consist in a conspiration of given
principles. There are logical reasons,
which give rise to logical results; and
there are metaphysical reasons, which
give rise to metaphysical results.
We will give an example of each.</p>

<p>In a syllogism, the consequence is
the result of a conspiration of two
propositions, called premises. The
propositions themselves are the <em>principles</em>
from which the conclusion is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
to follow; but the actual following
of the conclusion depends on the
actual comparison of the two propositions,
and on the actual perception
of the agreement of two extreme
terms with a middle one. It is, in
fact, through the middle term that
the two premises conspire into a definite
conclusion. Hence, when we
are asked the reason why a conclusion
follows from two premises, we
point out not only the fact that the
two premises are true, but especially
the fact that the extreme terms,
which are to be directly united in the
conclusion, are already both linked,
in the premises, with the same middle
term. For it is evident that the
whole strength of a legitimate conclusion
lies in the universality of the
axiom, <i lang="la">Quæ sunt eadem uni tertio,
sunt eadem inter se</i>. The words, <i lang="la">sunt
eadem uni tertio</i>,<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> express the formal

<p>For an example of the metaphysical
order, we will take a known subject,
<em>animal life</em>, and ascertain its
formal reason. Every one knows that
the soul is a principle of life; but
animal life, besides the vivifying
soul, requires also an organic body
as its other principle. These two
principles, however, are, with respect
to animal life, in the same relation as
the two premises with respect to
their conclusion. For as the conclusion
proximately results from the
connection of the premises and their
bearing on one another, as we have
just explained, so, also, animal life
results from the connection of soul
and body&mdash;that is, from the actuation
of the latter by the former, and consequently
by the completion of the
former in the latter. Hence, the
formal reason, or the <i lang="la">principium
formale quo</i>, of animal life is the
very information of the body by the
soul, while the soul and the body
themselves, taken together, constitute
the <i lang="la">principium formale quod</i>.</p>

<p>From these two examples, to
which it would be easy to add many
more, it is manifest that what we call
<em>formal reason</em> is <em>a conspiration of correlative
principles towards a common
actual result</em>. All results are relations
between terms, or principles, communicating
with one another, either
through themselves or through something
which is common to them.
In the first case, the result, or relation,
is transcendental, and is nothing
else than the <em>actuality</em> of one
principle in the other&mdash;of the soul
in the body, for instance. In the
second case, the result, or relation,
is either predicamental or logical
(according as its principles and its
formal reason are real or not), and
is nothing else than the <em>actuality</em> of
the terms as correlated.</p>

<p>Let the reader remark that we
have pointed out three kinds of so-called
formal principles, viz., the form,
or act, which is a <i lang="la">principium formale</i>
properly, and without qualification;
then the <em>principium</em>, <i lang="la">formale quod</i> of
a resultation, consisting of correlated
principles conspiring together into a
common result; lastly, the <i lang="la">principium
formale quo</i>, or the proximate
reason of the resultation, consisting
in the very conspiration of the correlated
principles. In English, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
better to distinguish the one from the
other, it would be well to retain the
name of <em>formal principle</em> for the first
alone; the second might be called
the <em>formal origin</em>, and the third the
<em>formal reason</em>, of a resultation. Thus
the name of <em>formal principle</em> would
be preserved to its rightful owner,
without danger of mistaking it for
a formal reason, or <i lang="la">vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>Before we conclude, we beg to
add, though it may appear unnecessary,
that the <em>conditions</em> of causation
are not principles. We make this
remark because nothing, perhaps, is
more common in ordinary speech
than to confound conditions with
principles and causes. It is not uninstructed
persons only, but educated
people and men of science too,
that express themselves as if they believed
that conditions have their own
active part in producing effects. If
a weight be suspended by a thread,
the cutting of the thread is popularly
said <em>to cause</em> the fall of the weight.
He who throws a piece of paper into
the fire is said <em>to burn</em> the paper.
He who rubs a match is said <em>to light</em>
the match. A change of distance between
the sun and a planet is said
<em>to cause</em> a change of intensity in the
central forces. Now, it is scarcely
necessary to show that <em>cutting</em> the
thread, <em>throwing</em> the paper, <em>rubbing</em>
the match, etc., are only conditions
of the falling, the burning, the lighting,
etc., respectively; and conditions
are neither causes nor principles
of causation. A <em>condition</em> of
causation may be defined to be <em>an
accidental relation between principles or
causes, inasmuch as they are concerned
in the production of an effect</em>.
Causes and principles cause and
principiate in a different manner, according
to the difference of their
mutual relations, but do not cause
or principiate <em>through</em> such relations,
as is evident.</p>

<p>A weight suspended by a thread
falls when the thread is cut. But
he who cuts the thread is not the
real <em>cause</em> of the falling. The true
<em>cause</em> is, on the one hand, the earth
by its attractive power, and, on the
other, the body itself by its receptive
potency. Cutting the thread is only
to put a condition of the falling.
The fall, in fact, depends on the condition
that the body be free to obey
the action of gravity; and this condition
is fulfilled when the thread is
cut. In like manner, he who throws
a piece of paper into the fire does
not burn it, but only puts it in the
necessary relation with the fire, that
it may be burnt; and he who rubs
the match does not light it, but
only rubs it, the rubbing being a
condition, not a cause, of the lighting.
In fact, the lighting of the match is
caused by the actions and reactions
which take place between the molecules
of certain substances on the end
of the match; and such actions and
reactions depend on the rubbing
only inasmuch as the rubbing alters
the relations of distance between
molecules, disturbs their equilibrium,
and places them in a new condition
with respect to their acting on one
another. Of course, the rubbing is
an effect, and he who does the rubbing
is a cause; but he causes the
rubbing only. So, also, the change of
distance between the sun and a planet
is neither the cause nor the principle
of a change of intensity in the
mutual attraction. The action of
celestial bodies follows a law. With
such or such relation of distance between
them, they act with such or
such intensity; but distance is evidently
not an active principle, and
therefore a change of distance is
only the change of a condition of
causation.</p>

<p>As we have just mentioned the
fact that celestial bodies are subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
to <em>a law of action</em>, it might be asked
whether <em>law</em> itself be a real principle.
We must answer in the negative;
for <em>law</em> is nothing but <em>the necessity
for every agent or patient of conforming
to its own nature in the exertion
of its powers, and in the subjection of
its potency</em>. Such a necessity is permanent,
since it arises from the determination
of nature itself, and may
be divided into <em>moral</em>, <em>physical</em>, and
<em>logical</em>, according as it is viewed in
connection with different beings or
powers; but it is certainly neither an
active power nor a passive potency,
but only a natural ordination of the
same, and accordingly is not a cause
nor a principle, but an exponent of
the constant manner in which causes
and principles bring about the various
changes we witness throughout
the world.</p>

<p>These few notions may suffice as
an introduction to what we intend to
say about the principles of things.
We have seen that a principle is less
than a cause, a reason less than a
principle, and a condition less than
a reason; and we have determined
as exactly as we could the general
character of each of them, by ascertaining
the grounds of their several
distinctions. This was our only object
in the present article; and therefore
we will stop here, and reserve
particulars for future investigation.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_144_144" id="Footnote_144_144"></a><a href="#FNanchor_144_144"><span class="label">[144]</span></a> Philosophers teach that one thing can precede
another in three ways, to wit, by priority
of <em>time</em>, by priority of <em>nature</em>, and by priority of
<em>reason</em>. A thing existing while another thing is
not yet in existence has, with regard to this latter,
a priority of time. A thing, on the existence
of which the existence of another depends, has,
with regard to this latter, a priority of nature. A
thing, the conception of which is needed to form
the conception of another, has, with regard to this
latter, a priority of reason. The priority of <em>origin</em>,
by which one of the divine Persons is prior to
another, is a priority of reason, not of nature,
and implies no real dependence of one Person
from another.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_146_146" id="Footnote_146_146"></a><a href="#FNanchor_146_146"><span class="label">[146]</span></a> We advisedly employ the preposition <em>from</em>.
There is a vast difference between depending <em>on</em>
and depending <em>from</em>. To depend <em>from</em> is properly
to be hanging from, as a lamp from the
ceiling; but nothing forbids the use of the phrase
in a metaphorical sense in order to translate the
Latin phrase, <i lang="la">pendere ab</i>, for which we have no
other equivalent. The usual English phrase, <em>to
depend on</em>, corresponds to the Latin <i lang="la">pendere ex</i>.
Were we to employ it also for <i lang="la">pendere ab</i>, a confusion
would arise of the two different meanings.
Certainly, the two phrases, <i lang="la">Homo pendet a Deo</i>,
and <i lang="la">Exitus pendet ex adjunctis</i> express different
kinds of dependence; and we cannot translate
them into English in the same manner without
setting their differences at naught. We
would, therefore, say, that <em>Man depends from
God</em>, and that <em>Success depends on circumstances</em>.
In philosophy, both prepositions are needed,
and, if used with proper discrimination, they
will save us the trouble of many useless disputes.</p></div>

be said to have a certain dependence <em>on</em> one another,
inasmuch as they have such an essential
connection with one another that the one cannot
be conceived apart from the other. But
this so-called "dependence" means only correlation
and "mutual exigency"; and therefore does
not entail a priority of nature of the one with
respect to the other. In a being, which is strictly
<em>one in its entity</em>, there are three principles: an
act, its term, and the actuality of the one in the
other. The act has only a priority of origin
with respect to its essential term, and both have
only a priority of origin with regard to their
formal actuality. They depend <em>on</em> one another
in the sense explained, but not <em>from</em> one
another. We shall treat of them in a future
article.</p></div>

<h3>THE FARM OF MUICERON.</h3>


<p class="center">BY MARIE RHEIL.</p>

<p class="center">FROM THE REVUE DU MONDE CATHOLIQUE.
</p>


<h4>VIII.</h4>

<p>Jean-Louis, on leaving the <i lang="fr">curé</i>,
went to pray in the church, which
remained open all day for the consolation
of devout souls. In the
presence of God he reviewed the sad
history of his life, shed many tears,
but soon felt wonderfully strengthened.
This fourteen-year-old boy had
a more resolute heart than many a
man of thirty. What he swore before
the altar of God and the statue
of Our Blessed Lady was the oath
of a Christian, who knows the value
of an engagement made in the face
of heaven. It was the contract of
his whole life that he then signed,
and it will be seen if he knew how
to keep it. His first weakness on
learning the secret of his birth had
passed; he determined to be courageous,
humble, and docile, should it
cost him his heart's blood; and full
of these brave resolutions, he retook
the road to Muiceron.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he failed in one, and
you as well as I will excuse him
for it.</p>

<p>As he had remained rather long in
the village, Pierrette, who had heard
him reprimanded, and had seen him
depart with his books under his arm,
became very anxious, fearing that he
had been more hurt than he had
shown. She was standing on the
threshold of the door, watching the
path by which he would return; and
when she perceived him, she could
not conceal her joy, for the child's
face was bright and animated, and
seemed the mirror of a happy heart.</p>

<p>"Oh! I am so happy to see you,
my Jeannet," cried the good woman
in a burst of joy.</p>

<p>"Were you alarmed at my absence?"
asked Jean-Louis, running to
her.</p>

<p>"Alarmed?" said she. "No ...
that is to say, yes, I was a little....
Your father sometimes conceals his
great kindness under rather too quick
a manner. A child like you, who
never deserves to be scolded, will be
easily hurt at a severe word; and I
thought, on seeing you go away so
quickly, you were unhappy. But
now you are at home again, are you
neither hot, nor hungry, nor troubled?
Where do you come from? What
do you think of doing? Tell all to
your mamma, who loves you so
dearly."</p>

<p>These gentle questions pierced the
soul of the poor child more than the
severest words would have done.
Gratitude and grief choked him and
prevented him from replying, and
made his emotion the greater, as
these two sentiments seldom go together.
He looked at his dear mother,
with his great, black eyes filled
with tears, and could only take her
hand and press it to his bosom.</p>

<p>Thus they entered the house together,
and Ragaud, whom they
thought in the fields, but who had
returned by the door that opened on
the bleaching yard, was standing before
the hearth, as if awaiting them.
You doubtless know, as you must
have many times experienced it, that
when one suddenly sees somebody,
thought to be half a league away, without
wishing it, he looks rather taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
aback, as we say. You can well believe
that Pierrette and the child so
looked, as they remained dumb as
fish, like poachers hiding from the
forest-guard.</p>

<p>"Well," said the good man in a
loud voice, "what is the matter with
you both? It seems I was not expected.
And the supper, wife?"</p>

<p>"Here it is," Pierrette hastened to
reply; "only move a little to one
side, that I may take off the pot."</p>

<p>And in the twinkling of an eye,
the excellent green-cabbage soup
was smoking on the table; but Jeannet,
who stood like one petrified, did
not move.</p>

<p>"You are not hungry, then?" asked
Ragaud. "What is the matter? You
look as if you had been crying."</p>

<p>"Excuse me," replied Jeannet. "I
do not feel like eating this evening."</p>

<p>"None of that," answered Ragaud;
"to punish his stomach is the act
of a spoiled child. Sit down and
eat; be quick about it, do you hear?"</p>

<p>Jeannet obeyed, but only to sit
down; eat, he could not.</p>

<p>"See here," said Ragaud in a joking
manner, looking at him, "you
are of the true modern style. Formerly,
my boy, when parents reproved
their children, they did it oftener
with the hand than the voice, and
things were not the worse for it. My
father used to give us blows with
his cudgel without counting them; in
his opinion, it was a language easily
understood, and which he preferred
to reasoning, as it saved his time.
We rubbed our backs, and it was
over; none of us thought of losing
our appetites, still less of crying.
But nowadays children must be
handled with gloves; and even with
that they think themselves martyrs.
The parents must endure everything
without a murmur, even to see the
house catch fire. Ha! ha!&mdash;is what
I say true?"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes," said Jean-Louis, "you
have always been good and kind to
me; and believe me, believe me when
I say that I am truly grateful, that I
thank you with my whole soul. I
was guilty without knowing it; but I
am penitent and sorry for having
offended you. I have carried back
my books, which, in reality, I did
not need, and never again will you
have to reproach me about them."</p>

<p>"That is right, that is right,"
said Ragaud. "You are a good child,
Jeannet, and now it is ended. What
I said, you see, was to your own
interest; so now eat and be cheerful.
I don't like tears, above all in a
boy who will soon be a man; give me
your hand without any bad feeling."</p>

<p>"No, no! embrace him," said Pierrette.
"His heart is full; isn't it so,
my son?"</p>

<p>"Kiss me, if you wish," said Ragaud,
extending his honest, bearded
face. "Generally I don't like these
baby-kisses; but if it is necessary, in
order that you may eat your soup,
make yourself happy, boy."</p>

<p>Just at this time it was too much
for Jean-Louis; nearly fainting, he
fell on his knees by the side of Ragaud;
he threw his arms around him,
pressed him to his breast, and kissed
him in the tenderest manner, to the
great astonishment of the good farmer,
who could not understand such
a wonderful display of affection.</p>

<p>"Good, good," said he; "but be
easy, Jeannet. Don't I tell you I am
no longer angry?"</p>

<p>"O my father! my dear father!"
cried the child, "how can I ever repay
you?"</p>

<p>And seeing that Ragaud looked at
him in amazement, he added, sobbing,</p>

<p>"Father, mother, I know all...."</p>

<p>"Explain yourself," said Ragaud,
beginning to understand what he
meant. "What do you know, my
child?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span></p>

<p>"<em>All</em>" he repeated in a tone
which expressed everything.</p>

<p>"There," cried good Pierrette, her
heart melting with pity, "I understand.
I know now what he means.
But after fourteen years that the
secret has been so well kept, where
has the creature been found wicked
enough to make this poor child so
unhappy?"</p>

<p>"Dear mother," exclaimed Jean-Louis,
"he who told it to me did it
from true kindness of heart; you
must not be displeased with him.
It is to him I owe my life, after God
and you. Do not mistake my tears;
they do not come from grief, but
from the gratitude which will last
through all eternity."</p>

<p>"My dear, dear child," said Pierrette,
"you have already well repaid
us by your tender affection and good
conduct. Isn't it true, Ragaud?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied he; "and I will
add, my boy, that the Lord God,
through love of whom we received
you, made joy and prosperity enter
into the house at the same time with
you. Thus, although I like the gratitude
which comes from a truly filial
heart, in good conscience I think
we are quits."</p>

<p>"Oh! never, never," cried Jeannet.
"At the moment of my death I
will still thank you."</p>

<p>"On condition that you die before
us, which is scarcely probable," said
Ragaud, smiling. "Come, child, get
up, and let it all be over. Since,
from what I can make out, no other
than our <i lang="fr">curé</i> has told you the story,
I am happy to think we are all 'big
John, as before'&mdash;that is to say, that
nothing is changed. You will remain
our child, the elder brother of Jeannette,
and the prop of my old age."</p>

<p>"Your servant and your slave for
ever!" cried Jean-Louis.</p>

<p>"Bah! bah! No slave, Jeannet;
that is an accursed word to fall from
your lips. Let it all remain in the
<i lang="fr">curé's</i> library, which it never should
have left. As for me, I am not
learned; but, to my mind, a slave is a
man changed into a beast of burden.
I ask you if I have brought you up
in that way? No, my son, you will
serve me&mdash;it is my wish&mdash;but in working
as a free man by my side, according
to your strength. Is it well understood?"</p>

<p>"I have no other desire but to
please you; and I pray to God, my
father, that I may prove it to you
every day."</p>

<p>"I hope so, my boy. The past,
they say, is the guarantee of the
future; and never have you caused
me serious displeasure. As for the
little affair of this morning, I tell you
it was nothing. Don't regret it; the
only result will be that we will love
each other still more."</p>

<p>"I think so, too," said Pierrette,
"if it is possible."</p>

<p>"O my dear parents!" cried
Jeannet, kissing them both, "if ever
the history of your kindness could be
written, who would believe it true?"</p>

<p>"Don't let that trouble you," said
Ragaud, laughing heartily, "there is
no chance of its being written; and,
besides, things do not improve by
being known to men, as evil is more
easily believed than good."</p>

<p>"It is very well," said Pierrette,
"that mademoiselle kept Jeannette
at the château this evening; she
would have been in the way, dear
little thing!"</p>

<p>"As regards that," replied Ragaud,
"I request you, Jean-Louis, never to
breathe a word to Jeannette of what
has just been said. Do you understand
me? I have my own idea
about it."</p>

<p>"I promise you, my father," answered
Jeannet.</p>

<p>The name of the little girl, thus
pronounced by chance, led to further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
conversation about the two children.
They remembered the infant plays,
where she was so lively and wilful,
her great romps with the shepherd's
dog, and many other little details,
which recalled the innocent pleasures
of her infancy and gave such zest to
their tranquil country life. Jeannet,
well consoled, and with lightened
heart, told his parents a crowd of
little events, which he loved to relate
in praise of Jeannette, and which
proved the goodness of her heart and
mind, to the great delight of the Ragauds.
From that to remarking that
the little girl had nearly disappeared
from the family was but a step, and
which, in my opinion, was a leap
easily made. In the meantime, Ragaud,
who appeared half asleep&mdash;I
rather think so as not to talk upon
the subject&mdash;suddenly awakened,
and ended by acknowledging that if
Jeannet were not at Muiceron, the
house would be as destitute of children
as it was fifteen years before.</p>

<p>"My dear husband," said Pierrette,
"it is not to-day that we are to learn
that parents must sacrifice everything
to the happiness of their children."</p>

<p>"For their happiness, yes," replied
Ragaud; "but it remains to be seen
if Jeannette will always be as happy
as she is now."</p>

<p>And as he was clear-sighted, when
the momentary vanity had passed, he
related with earnestness the conversation
with Jacques Michou, which he
had so unwillingly heard at the time.</p>

<p>"There," said Pierrette, "is something
which does not please me. If
people already commence to talk
about our daughter, it is a sign that
we should think about our course
in regard to her, and perhaps change
it."</p>

<p>"Think about it we should," replied
Ragaud; "but to change it
is another question. For then we
would have to take Jeannette from
mademoiselle; and as her regard for
our little girl is a great honor for us
and a great happiness for her, never
will I behave in that manner to the
daughter of our lords, seeing that I
owe them everything."</p>

<p>"It is very embarrassing," said
Pierrette, who spoke rather from the
feelings of the heart than of the
head.</p>

<p>"Not so very much," replied Ragaud.
"By acting with gentleness
and respect, without causing pain to
mademoiselle, we can, in the end,
make her wishes accord with ours."</p>

<p>"Oh! if Jeannette could return,"
cried Jean-Louis, "what happiness
for us all, dear father!"</p>

<p>"You!" said Ragaud. "You may
boast of being very brave in her
absence; but I can remember seeing
you many and many a time racing
together over the meadows; the girl
would torment you to her heart's
content, and you, like a big simpleton,
never once stumbled so as to
humbug her in return. Thus you
accustomed her to think herself the
mistress, which she did not hesitate to
show."</p>

<p>"She is so sweet," said Jeannet,
"and so good-natured; if she had
half killed me, I would not have
minded it."</p>

<p>"If you only wished to know
Latin that you might talk such nonsense,"
replied Ragaud, "you did
very well to give up the study.
You, too," added he, turning towards
Pierrette, forgetting he should be the
first to accuse himself&mdash;"you, too, have
so completely spoiled Jeannette, I
will be obliged to undertake the
difficult task of repairing your work.
But patience; to-morrow I will take
the shovel and the spade. I will
do it."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"
asked Pierrette, alarmed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am going to see," said Ragaud,
"if my daughter is of the good and
true blood of her father. I will ask
mademoiselle to give her to me for
the octave of S. Martin; and during
that time I will make her resume her
peasant-life as though she should
never quit it again. If she becomes
sullen and cross, I won't say what I
will do; but if, as I believe, she
will appear happy and contented, we
will know that the château does not
injure her, and then we will sleep in
peace. How do you like that?"</p>

<p>"Oh! that is a capital idea I
never would have dreamt of," said
Pierrette, clasping her hands in admiration.</p>

<p>Ragaud appeared pleased at being
thought so brilliant; he resettled
himself in his big linen collar, drank
a glass of good cider, and knelt down
to say the Our Father and Hail
Mary, which he always did before
retiring.</p>

<p>Jeannet made no remark; he had
too much sense to think that this little
trial would be sufficient and satisfy
every one; but he would see
Jeannette for a whole week, and he
decided to amuse her in such a way
that she would not regret her life at
the château.</p>

<p>Ragaud's plans were fully carried
out. Mademoiselle willingly gave
up Jeannette, thinking by that means
she would have still stronger claims
for keeping her afterwards; and the
little one, led by her father, returned
to Muiceron the eve of S. Martin's
day, which is, among us, the feast of
the vine-dressers.</p>

<p>If you are anxious to know how
she behaved, I will inform you that
the very next day, and without any
one having to tell her, she tumbled
over the things in the chest to find
her woollen skirts and coarse linen
apron. She had grown so much, she
was obliged to rip and remake for a
full hour before she could put them
on, which caused much talk and
laughter that rang through the
house. Her wooden shoes, which
had remained in a corner during the
past fifteen months, were likewise too
small; and as that could not be
remedied by the needle and thread,
it was a real difficulty; but Jeannette,
who had not lost her habit of having
an answer for everything, declared
she would wear Pierrette's. You can
imagine the amusement this caused;
and, in fact, at her first step she
stumbled, and nearly fell down.</p>

<p>Thereupon Jeannet darted off like
an arrow, and brought a new pair
from the harness-maker at Ordonniers.</p>

<p>Jeannette was equally well pleased
with the eating, sleeping, and all the
old habits of her country life. Never
had she appeared happier, more active,
and better disposed to assist
her mother in her household labors.
It could be well imagined that, having
heard of the gossiping about her, she
wished to prove by every means the
good people were wrong; and Ragaud
had only one wish, which was
that the busy-bodies of the village
could look through the key-hole and
see her at work.</p>

<p>This was scarcely possible; but he
could, at least, satisfy Jacques Michou,
the first grumbler, whom he had so
well repulsed, as you may remember.</p>

<p>For that purpose, without mentioning
the return of Jeannette to the
farm, with a frank and simple air,
he asked his old comrade to come
and break bread with him on S.
Martin's day. M. le Curé was also
invited, and on the morning of the
feast Ragaud gave Pierrette her
lesson:</p>

<p>"Understand well this day I wish
you to be quiet. You can tell the
child all that must be done, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
only for the cooking, but for the table
and the serving of it. I don't
wish to have the shame of seeing the
children seated at table, whilst the
mother is going around the hearth,
skirts pinned up, doing the servant's
work; which is not proper. It is very
well to be a good woman, always
ready to sacrifice herself; but it is also
well every one should know there
is but one mistress of Muiceron."</p>

<p>"Jeannette is too little," Pierrette
gently objected; "she could not
reach up to the stove, and I am
afraid the dishes will be too heavy
for her arms to carry, little darling!"</p>

<p>"You will make Marion, the dairy-maid,
aid her in the heavy work,"
said Ragaud. "I don't ask impossibilities,
and I would be the first to
fear if our little girl ran the risk of
burning herself. What I wish is that
she, and not you, should have all the
trouble."</p>

<p>Pierrette yielded to this good argument,
although a little afraid that
Jeannette would have too much
trouble. As for the little girl, she
was very proud to give orders to
Marion, and commenced immediately
to play her part of mistress of the
farm.</p>

<p>Then could be seen how bright
she was. She came and went, passing
from the barn-yard to the wood-house,
from the wood-house to the linen-chests;
bravely looking on when
they bled the chickens and cut up
the meat; selecting the beautiful,
white table-cloths; superintending,
polishing the glasses, dusting, flying
about like a will-o'-the-wisp. Big
Marion trotted after her on her heels,
scarcely able to follow her, stifled
half with heat and half with laughter
at the sight of such an active young
mistress.</p>

<p>Who would have thought, on seeing
her thus occupied, that the very
evening before she had been seated
at the right of mademoiselle in her
beautiful carriage, driving around the
country? It was really wonderful to
see her so quick at everything, young
as she was; and you would have
been as much surprised as the Ragauds,
who gazed at her in astonished
admiration&mdash;parental vanity easily
forgiven in this case&mdash;and asked
each other where Jeannette could
have learned so much that even
housekeepers of thirty hardly knew.</p>

<p>The truth was, she had never
learned anything from anybody or
anywhere; but she was precocious in
every respect. It was enough for her
to hear or see a thing once always to
remember it; so she had only to
think an instant to put in practice
what she had observed. Add to this
she was as sly as a fox, and ardently
loved to give satisfaction, and you
will easily understand there was nothing
very astonishing in her performance.</p>

<p>About twilight, Jacques Michou
made his appearance, accompanied
by the <i lang="fr">curé</i>, whom he had overtaken
on the road. Jeannette came forward
to meet them, and made a low reverence
in true peasant style, totally unlike
the bows made in M. le Marquis'
<i lang="fr">salon</i>. It was a great surprise for
these honest souls, who had been
conversing along the way about the
blindness of Ragaud in regard to
his daughter, and they were both too
frank not to show their satisfaction.</p>

<p>"So you have come back, my
child?" said the <i lang="fr">curé</i>, patting her
kindly on the head.</p>

<p>"To wait upon you, M. le Curé,"
she sweetly replied.</p>

<p>"And your beautiful dresses?"
asked Jacques Michou.</p>

<p>"They are hanging up in the wardrobe,"
said Jeannette, laughing.</p>

<p>"Indeed! And do you like to have
them there as much as on your back,
my little girl?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why not?" she replied. "I am
happy here with my father, my mother,
and Jeannet."</p>

<p>"It is your best place," said the
<i lang="fr">curé</i>. "I am delighted, Mme. Ragaud,
to see your daughter at home.
Is it for some time?"</p>

<p>"If mademoiselle does not reclaim
her," said Pierrette, blushing, for she
never would speak falsely, "it will
be for ever."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope it will be so," said
he. "And you, Jeannette, do you desire
it also?"</p>

<p>"I am always happy with my dear
parents," replied the little one; "but
mademoiselle is so kind and good, I
am always happy with her also. If
my mother sends me to the château,
I will go; and if she commands me to
return, I will come back."</p>

<p>They could not help being pleased
with this speech of the good,
obedient little girl, and they took
their places at table without any
further questions or raillery. Jeannette,
during the supper, rose more
than twenty times to see that all
was right; and Ragaud, you can well
imagine, did not fail to inform his
guests that everything had been prepared
under his daughter's eye. It
was strictly true, as they clearly saw;
and, consequently, the compliments
were freely bestowed. Nevertheless,
when the dessert was brought on,
Ragaud could not resist saying to
Michou, with a significant look, as he
held up his glass:</p>

<p>"Well, my old fellow, will you
now give me credit for knowing how
to bring up my children?"</p>

<p>Jacques nodded his head, and,
holding up his glass, replied, "I will
come to see you eight years from
now, comrade, and then I will answer
your question."</p>

<p>"Very good," said Ragaud. "M.
le Curé, you will be witness. I promise
to give a cow to Jacques Michou,
if, at that time, Jeannette is not
the best housekeeper in the country."</p>

<p>"I take the bet," replied Jacques,
laughing; "and I add that I hope
to lose it as surely as the good God
has no master."</p>

<p>"Come, come," said the <i lang="fr">curé</i>
gravely, "it is not worth such an
oath. Between good men, my friends,
it is enough to say yes or no. I
consent to be witness, and I also say
I hope that Jacques will lose the
bet."</p>

<p>They stopped as they saw Jeannette,
who returned to the table,
crimson with pleasure. Behind her
came big Marion, carrying, with
great care, a large dish, upon which
stood, erect on his claws, a beautiful
pheasant that seemed ready to crow.
As it was at the end of the meal,
every one looked at it with amazement,
especially Pierrette, who had
not been let into the secret. It was
a surprise invented by Jeannette,
who clapped her hands and laughed
heartily, and then wished them to
guess what it was. After she had
thoroughly enjoyed their astonishment,
she rapidly took out the feathers,
and then they saw it was a delicious
pudding, stuffed with plums,
which she had manufactured, with
Marion and Jeannet's assistance, after
the style of M. le Marquis' cook.
Pierrette, it must be acknowledged,
wept tears of admiration; for this was
a wonder that surpassed her imagination.</p>

<p>This magnificent performance increased
Ragaud's good humor; and
I verily believe, but for the presence
of M. le Curé, he would have emptied
more than one bottle in honor
of Jeannette and the pheasant. But
our good pastor, without being the
least in the world opposed to innocent
enjoyment, did not like the gaiety
which comes from drinking, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
we already know. Consequently,
they soon rose from the entertainment,
and wished each other a cordial
good-night. The little pet was
so worn out with her extraordinary
efforts, she soon after fell asleep in
her chair, and they had to carry her
off to bed. She was thoroughly tired,
and Pierrette observed it was not
surprising, after such a day's work,
which, perhaps, she herself could not
have stood.</p>


<h4>IX.</h4>

<p>That night something occurred
which appeared of small importance at
the time, but that had great results,
which many persons never understood,
and that I will reveal to you at
the proper time and place. For many
years it was a great mystery; and I
remember, when I was young, my honest
and pious father was conversing
in a whisper one evening, in the dim
twilight, with an old friend, and I hid
myself under a chair to find out
what he was saying; but not one
word of the secret could I make
out. Nevertheless, one fearful expression
I remembered for a long while.
When my father was tired with talking,
he dismissed his chum, saying:</p>

<p>"Now we will stop; and be silent
as the grave. You know you might
lose your head!"</p>

<p>And at these terrible words, the
friend replied by placing the finger
of his left hand on his lips, and with
his right pulled down his cap over
his ears, as if to make sure that his
head was still safe on his shoulders.
It was really a gesture which froze
one with terror; and as for me, I
shook so I thought I would overturn
the chair which served me for a hiding-place.</p>

<p>And now, I beg of you not to be
as curious as I was, for you would
gain nothing by it. I am only going
to tell you what happened the night
after the dinner on S. Martin's day.</p>

<p>No matter how late it might be,
Ragaud, excellent manager as he
was, never went to bed without having
carefully made the tour of all his
buildings with a dark lantern. He
remained seated by the fire, while
Pierrette carried off the little girl to
bed, and Jean-Louis retired to his
room. When all was still, he rose
and went out softly to commence his
round.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful night, rather
dark, but mild for November. Ragaud
walked through his little orchard,
from whence could be seen
the stables and barns, behind which
rose the tall fir-trees, unruffled by a
breath of wind. He passed into
the barn-yard, silent likewise; chickens,
geese, ducks, and turkeys slept
soundly, heads under their wings, on
the perches appropriated to them by
Pierrette. All was quiet and in good
order, and Ragaud, content with himself
and the world, prepared to re-enter,
when, accidentally raising his
head, he saw in the distance something
so astonishing he remained as
though nailed to the spot, and nearly
dropped his lantern in the excitement
of the moment.</p>

<p>The château of Val-Saint, which
could be seen from a certain point in
the garden, like a great, black mass
in the horizon, appeared as though
lighted up with sparks of fire. A
light would be seen first at one window,
then at another, and then disappear
as quickly as it came. Good
Ragaud could not believe his eyes.
Surely something extraordinary was
taking place at the château; for M.
le Marquis and mademoiselle, with
all due respect, went to bed with the
chickens, and the servants were not
allowed to remain up.</p>

<p>"What the devil is the matter
with me to-night?" thought Ragaud.
"Am I dreaming on my feet, or must
I fancy the two or three glasses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
white wine more than usual at dessert
have turned my brain?"</p>

<p>Not a bit of it; he saw perfectly
clear. The light danced about the
windows, as though to mock him,
and finally went out entirely. But
now comes the crowning mystery.
A great, blue star appeared on the
summit of the high tower, and rose
upward until it was hidden by a
cloud.</p>

<p>At the same instant, Ragaud felt
two heavy hands resting on his shoulders
and something breathe heavily
on his neck.</p>

<p>Indeed, only put yourself in his
place. There was something to fear;
and so the brave fellow, who in his
youth had fought in our great battles,
was all over goose-flesh. But it was
only momentary; for, quickly turning,
he saw that he had on his back the soft
paws of his dog Pataud, who, making
the rounds at his side, took this
means of caressing him.</p>

<p>"Down, Pataud, old fellow!" said
he gently; "it is not daybreak. Go
lie down! Be quick! Be off to your
kennel! Do you hear me?"</p>

<p>Pataud heard very well, but obedience
was not to his taste that night.
He wagged his tail, and appeared in
splendid humor; one would think he
suspected something was going on at
the château.</p>

<p>"So you think there is something
in the wind up there, do you?" asked
Ragaud, snapping his fingers in the
air. "Will you come with me, and
see what it is all about?"</p>

<p>At these words, he started as
though to leave the garden, and Pataud
this time seemed to consent.</p>

<p>"This comes from having an animal
well brought up," thought Ragaud.
"If you could speak, my cunning
old fellow, doubtless you would
tell me what I wish to know; but as
that can't be expected, I must remain
very anxious until the morning."</p>

<p>He re-entered the house after this
reflection, having obliged Pataud to
remain quiet by giving him a friendly
kick over the threshold of the kennel.</p>

<p>To sleep was difficult; he had the
faithful heart of an old servant, who
could not repose when he feared evil
was impending over his masters.
He remembered that ten years before,
on a similar night in November,
lights appeared in every window the
whole length of the façade of the
château, and on the next day, alas!
it was known they had been lighted
during the agony of our beloved mistress,
Mme. la Marquise de Val-Saint.
Was it not enough to make him apprehend
some misfortune for his dear
lord?</p>

<p>Poor mademoiselle's health was
not very robust, and she frequently
said, in such a mournful tone, that
the country air was not good for her.</p>

<p>"To-morrow," said Ragaud to
himself, "I will take back Jeannette
the first thing in the morning; if
mademoiselle is sick, it will do her
good to see her again; and perhaps I
would have done better if I had let
her remain. Who knows but the
dear soul was so fondly attached to
the child, she has become ill in consequence?"</p>

<p>You must know Ragaud listened
to the voice of his conscience as a
devotee hears a sermon; and once
persuaded that it was his duty to
take back to mademoiselle her favorite
plaything, twenty-five notaries
could not have shaken his decision.
Consequently, at the first break of
day, he took from the chest his Sunday
clothes, and was in holiday trim
when Pierrette came down to go out
and milk the cows. You can well
imagine her astonishment.</p>

<p>"Wife," said Ragaud, "go and
make Jeannette get up quickly, and
tell her to put on her château dress."</p>

<p>"Is it possible the child will leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
us so soon?" replied Pierrette, deeply
grieved.</p>

<p>"I wish it," said the good man,
"for reasons, Pierrette, that you will
know later."</p>

<p>She obeyed without answering.
Jean-Louis, meanwhile, entered the
room.</p>

<p>"Light the fire, boy," said Ragaud,
"and warm us up something. I
must go to the château with your
sister, and I will not take her out in
the cold, fasting."</p>

<p>"Father," said Jean-Louis, while
rapidly breaking up the fagots, "did
you see a bright light last night
around the big tower of the château?"</p>

<p>"Did you?" asked Ragaud.</p>

<p>"I saw something like a rocket
go up from the château," the boy replied.</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw it also," answered
Ragaud; "and Pataud did, too.
What do you think it could have
been, Jeannet?"</p>

<p>"I think," said Jean-Louis, "they
illuminated the château and fired off
rockets in honor of S. Martin."</p>

<p>"Very probable, child; that is a
good idea," said Ragaud laughing.
"Perhaps, after all, it is the whole
secret; but, any how, I would rather
go and find out."</p>

<p>"Shall I go with you, father?"
asked Jeannet.</p>

<p>"No, stay and help your mother;
if I want you, I will tell you. It is
enough that I must carry off the little
girl."</p>

<p>Jeannette all this time was dressing
as fast as possible, without asking
why or wherefore. She yawned
and rubbed her eyes, not having had
her full sleep; but I think the idea
of returning to her godmother was
not very disagreeable.</p>

<p>However, she was sufficiently
wide awake to swallow down a big
bowl of sweetened milk; after which,
Pierrette wrapped her up in a warm
shawl, and kissed her good-by with a
full heart.</p>

<p>All this had taken two hours; and
Ragaud not wishing to hurry her,
the village clock struck eight when
they reached the door of the château.</p>

<p>The first person they saw, contrary
to the usual custom, was Master Jean
Riponin, who was M. le Marquis'
man of business. From his imposing
manner and the great fuss he was
making&mdash;ordering every one here and
there with a voice as rough as the
captain of a fire-brigade&mdash;it was difficult
to fancy there was any one above
him in the château; Ragaud, sharp
fellow that he was, took it in at a
glance, and, instead of approaching
the steward, as he had always done,
without ceremony and a good shake
of the hand, he remained at a slight
distance, and touched his hat.</p>

<p>"It is you, Master Ragaud?" said
Jean Riponin with a patronizing air.
"Wait a moment; I will speak to you
after I have given my orders to these
stupid things."</p>

<p>"Don't disturb yourself," replied
Ragaud. "I have not come on business
to-day; I only wish to see mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"It is I who have received full
power from M. le Marquis at his
departure," replied Riponin, a little
provoked. "Mademoiselle is not up
yet; and, if she were, be assured, Ragaud,
she would send you back to
me. So let me know what you want
without further delay, as I am in a
hurry."</p>

<p>"Did you not say M. le Marquis
had left?" asked the farmer, as much
from interest as to cut short the
puffed-up superintendent.</p>

<p>"Yes, this morning before the day-dawn,"
said he; "and it seems it
was something very hurried, for he
had only time to hand me all the
keys of the house, except those of
his desk and safe, which were forgot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>ten
in his great haste. But he must
have already perceived it, and I expect
to receive those two keys by express."</p>

<p>"Indeed," thought Ragaud, "it
will be time enough to see them
when they come&mdash;that is to say, if
they will ever come." For he knew
Master Riponin was not a man who
regarded the marquis' crowns as
relics once that he saw the heap.
Fortunately, M. le Marquis was of
the same opinion; therefore, he kept
Riponin in his service on account
of many other good qualities that he
possessed; but as for the desk and
safe, he never saw anything but the
key-holes.</p>

<p>While Riponin and Ragaud were
conversing, mademoiselle, who had
just risen, drew aside her curtains to
see what caused such a noise in
the court; and the cunning little
Jeannette, as soon as she perceived
her godmother, kissed her hand to
her. In less than a minute, Dame
Berthe appeared at the door.</p>

<p>"M. Ragaud," said she, "I am
sent by mademoiselle to beg that
you will go to her immediately; and
you, Jeannette, run and kiss your godmother."</p>

<p>"M. Riponin, I wish you good-morning,"
said Ragaud, carelessly
turning his back on the steward.</p>

<p>The steward watched him enter the
château with anything but a pleased
expression; but he dared not show
his displeasure before Dame Berthe,
whom he knew was not friendly to him.</p>

<p>Dear mademoiselle's eyes filled
with tears when she saw her darling
pet. The little one was tender-hearted,
and was deeply moved by
this proof of affection. Ragaud, likewise,
showed great emotion, and
Dame Berthe said it would have
been a cruel shame to have longer
deprived the château of its chief
delight.</p>

<p>"Ragaud," said mademoiselle,
"my dear Ragaud, if you had not
come to-day, I was going myself to
bring back Jeannette. You see, I am
so unhappy."</p>

<p>"I did not think you loved the
child so much," replied Ragaud; "it
is a great honor for Jeannette and
for us all, dear mademoiselle, and I
desire nothing so much as to contribute
to your happiness."</p>

<p>"Only think," said mademoiselle,
sighing, "I am always alone; and
now that my father has left home, ...
and perhaps for such a long time!"</p>

<p>"Will M. le Marquis go far?...
Excuse my curiosity," said Ragaud;
"but you know, mademoiselle, I only
ask the question from the great interest
I feel in your dear family."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle was about to reply;
but Dame Berthe stopped her short
by glancing at Jeannette, who was
listening with profound attention.</p>

<p>"I will take her with me," said
she in a low tone to her governess,
"and then tell everything to
Ragaud; our family never keeps a
secret from this old servant."</p>

<p>When mademoiselle had withdrawn,
under the pretext of showing
some new article of the toilet to
Jeannette, Dame Berthe carefully
closed the door, and approached
Ragaud.</p>

<p>"Can I rely on your devotion?"
she asked in such a solemn manner
Ragaud could only bow his head in
assent. "And even on your life?"
continued Dame Berthe with a still
more serious air.</p>

<p>"If I must give it in exchange for
that of my master, yes, certainly,"
replied the faithful old fellow without
any hesitation.</p>

<p>"Very well. Sit down, Ragaud;
you are going to learn a secret&mdash;the
greatest secret a Christian can keep."</p>

<p>Ragaud sat down, rather astonished,
his heart beating in spite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
himself. However, strictly speaking,
the words of Dame Berthe appeared
a little exaggerated, and he felt so
without being able to account for it,
except from his own good sense.</p>

<p>"Master Ragaud," said the governess,
who was a devoted reader of
newspapers, and had learned to talk
in their style, "great events are preparing,
and, before long, the face of
the world will be changed."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Ragaud. "Excuse me,
my good lady, but the face of the
world, ... I don't know what that
means."</p>

<p>"When I speak of the world,"
resumed Dame Berthe, "I mean
France&mdash;<em>France</em>&mdash;Ragaud, our country."</p>

<p>"Now I understand better; yes,
I know that France is our country.
Well, then, what is going to be
changed in France?"</p>

<p>"Everything," said she, rising in
a frantic manner. "France, my good
Ragaud, is tired of the odious yoke
that has weighed her down for ten
years."</p>

<p>"My oxen are also sometimes
tired of the yoke," said Ragaud dryly;
"but that does not pay them
while the whip is around."</p>

<p>"Yes, but a nation can't be whipped
like a beast of burden," replied
Dame Berthe. "Come, Ragaud, I see
you do not understand what I am
aiming at."</p>

<p>"No, not at all," said he. "I am
not learned, my good lady; sometimes
I hear such expressions as you
use when M. le Curé reads aloud
from some public journal; but, between
ourselves, it always puts me to
sleep. You see, the useful things in
the newspapers, for a farmer, are the
price of grain and the announcement
of the fairs; the rest is all twaddle
for me."</p>

<p>"So it appears," answered Dame
Berthe, a little hurt. "I am now going
to talk in a way that you can understand.
Well, then, Ragaud, M. le
Marquis left home last night. Where
do you think he has gone?"</p>

<p>"It is not my custom to inquire
into the private affairs of my masters,"
replied Ragaud. "By chance I
walked through my garden late last
night, and I saw the château lighted
up. I was afraid mademoiselle was
ill; so this morning I brought back
Jeannette to amuse her. In the
court, M. Riponin told me of the
departure of M. le Marquis; and
now I do not wish to hear anything
further, unless you judge it necessary."</p>

<p>"It will certainly be useful," said
Dame Berthe, who was longing to tell
all she knew, "you will agree with
me, M. Ragaud, when you know
that M. le Marquis was called off
by a letter, which assured him that
they were only waiting for him...."</p>

<p>"To change <em>the face of the world</em>,"
said Ragaud with dry humor.</p>

<p>"Precisely," replied Berthe seriously.
"It appears that the insurrection
has broken out near Angers, where
there are thousands of armed men.
Monsieur, who fought with the Chouans
in his youth, will be appointed
general, and they will advance
to the capture of Paris, where nothing
is suspected. The usurper will be
driven out, M. Ragaud, and our dear
young legitimate prince will ascend
the throne. Won't it be magnificent?
Dear Eveline will go to court.
Poor child! she has been so long
tired of the country."</p>

<p>"Hum!" said Ragaud, not the
least bit excited. "Are they very
sure of all that?"</p>

<p>"Sure? How can it be doubted,
when the friend of M. le Marquis in
that province declares, do you understand&mdash;declares
positively&mdash;that it
only needs a spark to set fire to the
powder?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span></p>

<p>"To the powder!" cried Ragaud,
this time very much frightened. "Are
they dreaming of blowing up the magazine
at Angers? That would be
a terrible misfortune, my dear lady."</p>

<p>"Be easy," replied Dame Berthe,
shrugging her shoulders. "I always
forget that you don't read the papers.
'Setting fire to the powder' means
to kindle the insurrection, to inflame
the minds and hearts of the people;
and it is expected that, at the first
word, the country will rise as one
man."</p>

<p>"They are going to fight?" said
Ragaud. "Battles are not gay, and
the poor fare badly in time of war."</p>

<p>"Fight? Oh! you are blind, my
dear M. Ragaud," replied Dame Berthe,
laughing with the most charming
simplicity. "Do you expect a
few little regiments to withstand millions
of men? Before a week, the insurgents
will be counted by millions.
And now, if you wish to know the
real truth, ... well, ... the army
itself is with us."</p>

<p>"Ah! indeed," said Ragaud.
"This is great news."</p>

<p>"Do you think those gentlemen
would be so silly as to commence
the work without being assured of
this support?" replied the governess,
clasping her hands. "My God! Ragaud,
for whom do you take M. le
Marquis and his friends?"</p>

<p>"For brave men, most assuredly,"
said the farmer, unable to repress a
smile; "and since all is so well
arranged, Dame Berthe, allow me,
with all due respect, to ask you two
questions. In the first place, when
will the marriage come off? In the
second, what does my dear master
wish me to do under the circumstances?"</p>

<p>"When will the marriage take
place? You mean, when will the
king enter Paris?"</p>

<p>"Just so, my good lady."</p>

<p>"I don't think this great event could
possibly take place before a month,
or three weeks at soonest. Although
this revolution, inspired by God, must,
I am fully convinced, spread like
lightning, time flies rapidly; and then,
we must always think of unforeseen
accidents."</p>

<p>"Doubtless, doubtless; it is always
more prudent," said Ragaud.</p>

<p>"As for what M. le Marquis
expects of you, my good Ragaud,
it is very easy. It would be shameful,
you know, when all France is
rising in arms for her true sovereign,
to see Val-Saint and the neighborhood
sleeping in carelessness and
indolence. You are, then, designated&mdash;you,
Jacques Michou, who for
forty years has been the head-keeper
of the estate, Master Perdreau, the
notary of the family, and some other
old servants&mdash;you are expected to
prepare the people for the change
about to take place, and make them
cry 'Long live the King!' throughout
the commune."</p>

<p>"And if they won't do it?" asked
Ragaud innocently; "for, in truth,
that is to be well considered."</p>

<p>"They will do it; they will <em>all</em> do
it," cried Dame Berthe. "France is
burning with the desire of uttering
this cry of love and gratitude," she
added, remembering that she had
just read this expression in her morning
paper.</p>

<p>"So much the better," said Ragaud;
"and it only remains to thank
you for your confidence, my dear
lady, and I will do my best to fulfil
the wishes of M. le Marquis."</p>

<p>The entrance of mademoiselle,
who thought there had been time
enough for the secret to be told and
retold, cut short the conversation, as
she brought Jeannette with her. Ragaud
bowed politely to the ladies of
the château, kissed his daughter, told
her to be good and obedient, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
closed the door behind him, his head
full of all he had just heard.</p>

<p>Dame Berthe overtook him at the
head of the staircase.</p>

<p>"Ragaud," said she, "you told me
you were up late last night. Did you
not see, about midnight, a blue light
go up from the summit of the
tower?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Ragaud, "and I
was dumb with astonishment; I do
not conceal it."</p>

<p>"It was the given signal to warn
several châteaux of the neighborhood
of the departure of M. le Marquis.
Watch all these nights, for we
expect a messenger, who will come
to announce the triumph of the holy
cause, and then a second light will
go up at the same hour. This one
will be red, and, when you see it, you
will instantly march, with the armed
bands you will have assembled, to
join the grand army."</p>

<p>"All right," said Ragaud; "we
will do our best."</p>

<p>And he descended the staircase
slowly, without appearing the least
excited.</p>

<p>"Eveline," said Dame Berthe,
pressing mademoiselle to her breast,
"thank God, my dear child. I have
had the happiness of completely
winning over good Ragaud to the
holy cause. He is even more ardent
than myself, and as well disposed as
we could wish. Before long, we will
see Val-Saint and Ordonniers rise
and march to victory under the command
of this brave peasant. Jacques
Cathelineau and M. Stofflet
should be of the same stamp. What
I admire in Ragaud is that cold
determination, which would make
one fancy he was not enthusiastic;
but I am not deceived by appearances."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said mademoiselle,
"all will be over in time for us to go
and finish the winter in Paris."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of it," replied
Dame Berthe; "and thus, my dear
child, as I have thought the dressmakers
might be half crazy with the
quantity of court-dresses that would
be ordered, I have already decided
what your costume is to be on the
entrance of the king into Paris; for I
expect the daughter of the commander-in-chief
to be the first to salute
her sovereign; and I will immediately
commence to embroider the satin
train, so as to be ready."</p>

<p>"How good you are! You think
of everything!" said mademoiselle,
very much overcome. "I wish I
was there now!..."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Dame Berthe, "only
be patient."</p>

<p>After leaving the château, Ragaud,
with his hands in his pockets, went
off in search of his old comrade, Jacques
Michou, that he might consult
with him over Dame Berthe's revelations.
Jacques lived alone&mdash;being
a widower and childless&mdash;in a little
house close to the edge of the woods
that bordered La Range. He had
no one about him but a niece of his
late wife, whom he fed and clothed;
in return for which, she cooked for
him and cleaned his hunting-gun.
The girl was little trouble to him;
she was idiotic and half dumb, and,
among other little eccentricities, liked
to sleep with the sheep. So, in the
summer she camped out on the
meadow with the flock, and in winter
slept in the sheepfold, which certainly
had the advantage of keeping
her very warm, but could have had
no other charm. From this habit
she had acquired the name of <em>Barbette</em>
throughout the country; and it
was not badly given, as with us a
great many shepherd-dogs are called
Barbets, on account of the race; and
since the poor girl shared their office,
she had at least a claim to the name
if she so pleased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span></p>

<p>Jacques Michou, on his side, had
his particular fancies. First of all
was the idea (which he would only
give up with his life) that, in virtue
of his badge and his gun, he was the
head-keeper of M. le Marquis de
Val-Saint. Now, we must acknowledge
it was mere show, there was
nothing in it; for our good lord never
wished to displease any one, not
even the poachers. He said there
was always some good in those men;
and as in everything he pursued one
aim&mdash;which was, as you know, to enrol
one day or other all our boys in a
regiment for the benefit of the king&mdash;he
preferred to be kind to these bold
and cunning rascals, who were not
easily hoodwinked. After a while,
Jacques Michou became weary of
carrying the delinquents before M.
le Marquis only to see them graciously
dismissed, so it ended by his letting
them alone; and at the end of a
few years, his principal occupation
was to carefully keep to the right of
the estate in making his rounds
when he knew the poachers were
at work on the left. However, he
took pride in letting them know that
each and every one could be caught
at any moment he wished; he knew
every path in the woods as well as
the bottom of his sauce-pan, and all
the thieves as though they belonged
to his family. When he met the
rascals, he threatened them with
loud voice and gesture, and swore
tremendous oaths that made heaven
and earth tremble. "But," he would
shout, "what can I do? Robbers
and vagabonds that you are, if M.
le Marquis allows himself to be plundered,
the servant must obey the
master's orders; but for that, you
would see!" And the end of the story
was&mdash;nothing was seen.</p>

<p>You can understand very well that
the brave old fellow, having only the
title of keeper, and nothing to show
for it but the fine silver badge, engraved
with the arms of the family
of Val-Saint, which he wore on the
shoulder-strap of his game-bag, clung
all the closer to the empty honor,
and allowed no joking on the subject.</p>

<p>When Ragaud entered his friend's
house, he found him carving playthings
out of cocoanut-shells&mdash;something
which he did wonderfully well&mdash;and
in a few words related what had
taken place at the château.</p>

<p>"We will find ourselves floundering
in the mire," said Ragaud. "As
for me, I am ready to promise before
the good God that I will give my
life to fulfil the commands of our
dear master; but it remains to be
seen if many around here are of my
opinion."</p>

<p>"Many?" exclaimed Jacques,
shrugging his shoulders. "Bah! I
am very sure you will not find one
out of a dozen!"</p>

<p>"If it is true," replied Ragaud,
with hesitation; "I wonder if it is
really true about the insurrection in
Anjou?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Jacques Michou.
"That poor M. le Marquis is
crazy on one point, which takes him
out of the country every five or six
years for change of air, and that is
good for his health; for every man
needs hope to keep him well. That
is the truth of the business."</p>

<p>"Do you think, then, we had better
not attempt to fulfil his orders?"
asked Ragaud.</p>

<p>"As for that, a good master must
always be obeyed, old fellow; we
can say a few words here and there
quietly. You will find the people
as stupid as owls, and they will understand
you as well as though you
spoke Prussian. We shall have done
our duty. As to monsieur, he will
return before long, a little cross for
the moment, but not at all discouraged&mdash;take
my word for it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is a great pity," said Ragaud,
"that a man of such great good sense
couldn't listen to reason!"</p>

<p>"Why so?" replied Jacques. "A
great lord like him is bound in honor
to be devoted, body and soul, to
his king; for you see, Ragaud, the
king who is not on the throne is the
real one&mdash;no doubt about that. But
often one tumbles over in running
too fast; and since it appears not to
be the will of the good God that
things should return to the old style,
it would have been much better not
to have sent off letters, gone off at
night, and fired off signals. It is just
as if they had played the flute. Men
stop a moment, listen, and then, the
music ended, each one returns to his
plough."</p>

<p>"You speak capitally," said Ragaud;
"it is just what I think also; so
I will do as you say&mdash;neither more nor
less. But we will agree on one point,
old fellow, which is, to have an eye
on the château, so that we can defend
the doors if the women are
threatened."</p>

<p>"Bah! bah! No fear about that,"
said Michou, shaking him by the
hand. "I will give my life for all
that belong to the house of Val-Saint,
comrade. I would as willingly fire
a pistol in defence of monsieur,
mademoiselle, and the old fool of a
governess, as for the hares and rabbits
on the estate. But for these
it would be powder thrown away,
as monsieur, we must believe, only
likes butcher's meat, and prefers
to leave his game for those devils
of thieves!"</p>

<p>Thereupon the worthy old souls
refreshed themselves with a jug of
cider, and conversed together for
some time longer, principally repeating
the same ideas on the same subject,
which was the one we have just
related&mdash;something which often happens
to wiser men than they, and,
therefore, I consider it useless to tell
you any more of their honest gossip.</p>

<p>They separated about mid-day,
and I will inform you what was the
result of the great insurrection. At
Angers, as with us, it was as Michou
had predicted. M. le Marquis
returned from his trip rather fatigued
and thoroughly disgusted with
France, which he called a ruined
country. Mademoiselle wept for a
week that she could not go to Paris.
Dame Berthe commenced Novenas
to the Blessed Queen Jeanne, in
order that the next enterprise, which
would not be long delayed, might
succeed better than the last; and
the result of all was that Jeannette
remained more than ever at the château,
as she was the greatest consolation
to her dear godmother.</p>


<h4>X.</h4>

<p>I think we will do well, at this period
of our story, to pass over several
years, during which time nothing of
great importance occurred. In the
country, days succeed each other
in undisturbed tranquillity, unmarked
by many great events. According
as the spring is rainy or dry, the
villagers commence the season by
making predictions about the summer,
which, twenty times out of twenty-two,
are never fulfilled. It must
be acknowledged that we peasants
seem afraid to appear too well pleased
with the good God; and, though
it is a great fault, unfortunately
it is not rare. Men grumble and
swear, first at the sun, and then at
the wind, for burning and parching
their fields; and when the rain commences,
there is another cause for
displeasure; and most of all, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
end of summer, when, after these
doleful repinings, the harvests have
been plentiful, far from thanking the
Lord God, who, instead of punishing
them, has sent blessings, they instantly
commence to worry about
the approaching vintage. And so
S. Sylvester's day finds them with
well-stacked barns and cellars filled
with barrels of wine, but not to
make them wiser the year after from
such experience, which should teach
them faith in divine Providence.</p>

<p>Whence I conclude that men are
only incorrigible, gabbling children,
and that the good God must have
great patience and mercy to tolerate
them. Much more could be said on
this subject; but, not being a priest,
I prefer to leave off moralizing, and
return to our friends.</p>

<p>Therefore, we will, if you please,
resume our narrative about seven
years from where we left off, at
which time Jeannette Ragaud had
nearly completed her sixteenth year
and Jean-Louis his twentieth.</p>

<p>Weeks and months, rapidly passing,
had brought them from childhood to
youth without their knowing it, and
they had each followed their inclinations,
as might easily have been foreseen.
Jeannette, well educated, coquettish,
and extremely pretty, was
the most charming little blonde in
the province. She scarcely ever
came to Muiceron, except on Sundays
and festivals, between Mass
and Vespers; and if you ask me how
this could have happened, so contrary,
as you know, to the wishes of
father and mother Ragaud, I will
reply that I know nothing, unless
there is a special wind which blows
sometimes over men's desires, and
prevents their ripening into facts.
To be convinced of this truth needs
only a little unreserved frankness.
See, now, you who listen to me,
you may be more learned than
a schoolmaster, and more malicious
than a hump-back&mdash;that I will not
dispute; but if you will swear to
me that everything in this life has
happened as you desired, without
change or contradiction, I will not
hesitate to think you, but for the
charity which should reign among
Christians, the greatest liar in your
parish.</p>

<p>If any one spoke to Ragaud about
the dangerous road in which he had
placed his daughter, and that there
was no longer chance to retrace his
steps, he did not show displeasure or
excuse himself, as heretofore. His
serious and rather sorrowful air, joined
to a very convenient little cough,
showed more than by words that he
did not know how to reply, and the
poor man was truly sensible of his
weakness and error; but what could
he do? Something always happened
to prevent him from carrying out
his intention of taking Jeannette from
the château.</p>

<p>Sometimes mademoiselle was sick;
sometimes it was a festival of the
church that needed a reinforcement
of skilled embroiderers to make
vestments and flowers for the altars;
another day Dame Berthe had gone
off for a month's vacation. In winter
the pretext was that Jeannette's
health would be endangered if she
resumed her peasant life, as she could
not bear the exposure; and when
that was over, the summer days
were so long, mademoiselle would
have died of <em>ennui</em> without her darling
Jeannette; and all this mademoiselle
explained with such a gentle,
winning air, old Ragaud never could
refuse her; so that at last he was so
accustomed to ask and be refused
each time that he went for Jeannette,
he finally abandoned the attempt;
and seeing that his visits to the
château were mere matters of form,
he submitted with good grace, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
making none at all, at least with
that intention.</p>

<p>As for good Pierrette, she remained
quiet; but accustomed to submit,
and filled besides with admiration
for the great good sense of her husband,
she told all her troubles to
the good God, and awaited, without
complaint, the time when he would
decree a change. But yet I must
say things were not so bad as you
might fancy. Life at the château
had not spoiled Jeannette's heart.
She was rather light-hearted, and the
vanity of fine clothes had more effect
on her than that of position; but as
for her parents, she adored them,
and overwhelmed them with embraces
and kisses on her visits to the
farm, which gave her undisguised
pleasure. Our <i lang="fr">curé</i>, who watched
her closely, and who never liked to
see country girls quit the stable for
the drawing-room, was forced to acknowledge
that the affair had not
turned out so badly as he apprehended;
and although he did not
hesitate to scold mademoiselle for
spoiling Jeannette&mdash;which he had
the right to do, as he had known her
from her birth, and had also baptized
her&mdash;it was easy to see, by his fond,
paternal air, that he loved the child
as much as at the time when Germaine
whipped her.</p>

<p>I will also tell you that this good
pastor was beginning to feel the
weight of years. He lost strength
daily, and, like all holy men, his
character softened as he drew nearer
to the good God. Besides, fearing
that soon he would be unable to visit
his beloved flock, he thought rightly
it was better not to be too severe, as
it might wean them from him.</p>

<p>"For," said he, "if it is true that
flies are not caught by vinegar, it is
still more evident that men are never
won by scolding and threats."</p>

<p>It was a sound argument, and, consequently,
who was more venerated
than the <i lang="fr">curé</i> of Val-Saint? I will
give only one proof. His parishioners,
seeing that walking fatigued
him, consulted among themselves at
a fair, and resolved to buy him a
steady animal, with a sheep-skin saddle
and leather reins, embroidered in
red, according to the country fashion.</p>

<p>It so happened that just at that
moment a pedlar, owning a good
mule, wished to barter it for a
draught-horse, put up for sale by
a farmer from Charbonnière. The
bargain was made after a short parley,
and our good friends returned
home joyfully, and, without saying a
word, tied their present to the tree
before the priest's house. It was
too good an act to be kept silent;
the next day the <i lang="fr">curé</i> and all the
parish knew it. I need not ask
who was deeply moved. The following
Sunday our dear <i lang="fr">curé</i> thanked
his flock with words that repaid
them a hundred-fold; and really, if
you know anything about country
people, you must say, without meaning
any wrong by it, they are not
accustomed to be generous; therefore,
a little praise was fully their
due.</p>

<p>As for the mule, it was a famous
beast. She was black, and sniffed
the air at such a rate, she always
seemed eager to start off at full gallop;
but, fortunately for our dear old
<i lang="fr">curé</i>, it was only a little coquetry she
still practised in remembrance of
her youthful days, and never went
further. After making six or seven
paces, she became calmer, dropped
her head, and trotted along as quietly
as a lady taking up a collection in
the church. Otherwise she was gentle
and easily managed, except at
the sight of water, into which she
never could be induced to put her
foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span></p>

<p>"But who has not his faults?" as
the beadle of Val-Saint was accustomed
to say to his wife, when she
scolded him for returning home rather
the worse for having raised his
elbow too often.</p>

<p>In speaking a little here and there
about each and every one, don't
think that I have forgotten Jean-Louis;
on the contrary, I have kept
the dear boy as the choicest morsel.</p>

<p>You must not expect me to relate
in detail all his acts and gestures. In
the first place, he spoke little, and
what he said was so kind and gentle
that, if he was forced to deal with
the noisiest brawler in the neighborhood,
he soon conquered him by his
mildness. One reason of this was
that, having learned so young the
painful circumstances of his birth, and
being proud by nature, he controlled
himself before people, in order not to
provoke any insolence. I must also
add that the greater part of our
young men get into trouble over
their wine; and for Jeannet there was
nothing to fear in that respect. Why,
you can easily guess: because he
knew nothing of the tavern, but the
entrance and the sign&mdash;just what could
be seen in passing along the street.</p>

<p>The good fellows, his companions,
loved him dearly; the wicked were
forced to respect him, and feared him
also, as Jeannet had grown up tall,
and had arms strong enough to stop
a mad bull; and as for work, no one
could compete with him. Only one
thing on earth he feared, and that
was to commit a sin. And do you
know, that those who have only this
fear can overcome, with a sign, a raging
madman? It daily happens, as
much in the city, among the black
coats, as in the village, among the
blouses. Try it, and you will be
convinced, and then you will acknowledge
I speak the truth.</p>

<p>The Ragauds, as they watched
this pearl of a boy grow up, learned
to love him more than many parents
do their legitimate sons. He was
worth five hired men, and Ragaud,
with his strict sense of justice, had
calculated the value to the last cent,
and for the past ten years had placed
to his credit in the savings-bank,
every 1st of January, one thousand
francs, upon which the interest was
accruing. Jean-Louis knew nothing
of the secret, and never did he
dream his labor was worth remuneration.
The boy's mind and heart
were so thoroughly at ease that,
knowing he had not a cent, and
nothing to expect on the death of
his parents, as they had a daughter,
he never troubled himself about the
present or the future, believing firmly
that the good God, who had given
him a family, would provide for his
daily wants; for this second blessing
was nothing, in his eyes, in comparison
with the first.</p>

<p>Pierrette was careful that her Benjamin's
pocket was never empty.
At Easter and on S. John's day she
always gave him a five-franc piece;
and even this was often too much,
as Jeannet's clothes and linen were
always kept in perfect order by his
devoted mother, and, consequently,
as he never indulged in dissipation,
and seldom joined in the village
games, he did not know how to spend
it. He would have liked sometimes
to treat himself to a book when the
pedlar&mdash;the same who had sold the
mule to the farmers for M. le Curé&mdash;came
around, and Ragaud, sure now
of his good conduct, would certainly
not have objected; but one day,
after having searched over the package,
he bought for thirty sous what
he thought was a good and entertaining
work, as it bore the seal placed by
the government on all publications
peddled through the country; but, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
his horror, he found it filled with
villanous sentiments. This saddened
and disgusted him for several days;
these thirty sous laid heavy on his
mind, not from the avaricious
thought that he had thrown his
money to the wind, but from the
idea that he had wronged the poor;
for thirty sous was the exact price of
a six-pound loaf of bread of the best
quality. Between ourselves, I verily
believe he accused himself of it in
confession, as what I ever heard of
the good boy makes me think it most
likely he would do so.</p>

<p>Perhaps you would like to know
if Jean-Louis had grown up handsome
or ugly. Well, he was ugly, at least
according to common opinion; we
villagers admire red faces and those
who look well fed, and dress showily.
Jeannet's face was long and pale; his
features delicate; teeth white and
beautiful, in a large mouth that seldom
smiled; and his deep, dark eyes
were brilliant as stars; and when
those eyes looked in displeasure at
any one, they were fearful. Besides,
Jean-Louis, who was tall, appeared
so thin you would have thought
him a young gray-beard, ready to
break in two at the first breath of
wind. With us, thin people who
have not a pound of flesh on their
bones are not admired, and it is
quite an insult to be called thin. I
think that is all nonsense, for vigor
does not come from fat, but from
good health, flesh strengthened by
exercise and good habits; and as
Jeannet was acknowledged to be the
strongest boy in the neighborhood,
he was only called thin from jealousy,
as he certainly could thank God for
being a sound young man, as strong
as the foundation of a barn.</p>

<p>The only amusement he allowed
himself was sometimes, on great festivals,
to assist at the pigeon-shooting
which M. le Marquis had established
on the lawn before the château.
It was a difficult game, which demanded
good sight, coolness, and,
above all, great strength of wrist.
Jeannet, on two successive years, carried
off the prize; the first was a silver
goblet, the second a beautiful
knife, fork, and spoon of the same
metal. On these occasions his pale
face became red with pleasure; do
you think it was from vanity? Not
at all. If his heart beat quickly, it
was at the thought of the splendid
presents he would make his good
mother Pierrette; and, in reality, he
made her promise she would never
drink a drop or eat a mouthful but
out of the goblet or with the knife
and fork. We must say, in spite of
the crowns heaped up at Muiceron,
the earthen pipe and tin cups were
alone used. At first Pierrette was ill
at ease with her silver service, but
she nevertheless accustomed herself
to the use of it, so as to please Jeannet;
and at last, to make her feel
more comfortable, Ragaud, on his
next trip to the city, bought himself
a similar set, very fine, for eighty-four
francs, which he constantly said
was rather dear; but at heart he
thought it very suitable, as it was
not proper for his wife to eat with
silver and he with tin; and to Jeannet's
mind, who regretted that he
had not drawn four prizes instead of
two, so as to delight both his dear
parents, a brighter idea had never
entered his good father's head.</p>

<p>If I relate all these little anecdotes
at length, it is to show you Jeannet's
good heart; and without speaking ill
of little Jeannette, who had also her
fine points, I think her brother surpassed
her in delicate attention to
their parents, which I attribute to
the difference in their education.
Believe me, it is always better to let
a cabbage remain a cabbage, and
never attempt to graft a melon upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
it. You will make nothing worth
eating; for the good God, who created
the cabbage on one side, and the
melon on the other, likes each to remain
in its place, without which you
will have a hybrid vegetable, which
will not really be of either species.</p>

<p>Pierrette, like a true woman, knowing
Jeannet's excellence, often thought
he could make some woman very
happy, and that it was her duty to
speak to him of marriage, since he
was twenty years old, and they knew
he would never have to enter the
army, even though he should draw
the fatal number. One evening, when
she was spinning beside the hearth,
with Jean-Louis near her, making
a net for catching birds, she commenced
to speak of the happiness of
her married life, the blessings she had
received from heaven, and her perfect
contentment on all points. Jean-Louis
listened with pleasure, and acknowledged
that a happy marriage
was something to be envied, but, according
to his custom, never thinking
of himself, he did not dream of wishing
this fine destiny might one day
be his.</p>

<p>"And you, my Jean, would you
not like to marry?"</p>

<p>Jean-Louis dropped his shuttle,
and looked at Pierrette with astonishment.</p>

<p>"What an idea!" said he. "I have
never even thought of it, dear mother."</p>

<p>"It is nevertheless very simple,
my son. Ragaud was your age when
he married me, and, when his parents
asked him the same question, he
thought it right, and instantly replied,
yes!"</p>

<p>"Doubtless he knew you, and
even loved you; then I could easily
understand it."</p>

<p>"That is true," replied Pierrette,
slightly blushing; "for a year before,
the dear man had cast glances at me
on Sundays at High Mass; at least,
he told me so after we were engaged.
Why don't you do likewise?"</p>

<p>"For that, I should be obliged to
think of some of the girls around us,
and I have never troubled myself
about them yet."</p>

<p>"That is queer," said Pierrette innocently.
"You are not like other
men; for without showing particular
attention, it is allowable to look at
the girls around when one wishes to
be established."</p>

<p>"Bah!" said Jeannet; "but I don't
care about anything of the kind.
When I am in the village on Sunday,
I have something else to think
about."</p>

<p>"About what, dear boy?"</p>

<p>"Well, then, I think that we will
all be quiet at Muiceron until evening,
and I hasten to return, so as to
sit down near you, as I am now, and
laugh and talk to amuse you; and I
don't wish any other pleasure. Besides,
it is the only time in the week
when we can see Jeannette; and, to
speak the truth, dear mother, I would
not give that up for all the marriages
in the world."</p>

<p>"All very well," replied Pierrette;
"but without giving up those pleasures,
you can take a wife."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Jeannet, "I see that
you are tired of me, or else you
would not speak thus."</p>

<p>"What do you say?" replied Pierrette,
kissing him on the forehead.
"It is not right to speak so, and
surely you do not mean it. On the
contrary, whether you marry or
remain single, I never wish you to
leave me. There is room enough for
another woman, and even for children.
What I proposed, my Jean,
was for your happiness, and nothing
else."</p>

<p>"Well, then, dear mother, let me
remain as I am; I never can be happier
than now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span></p>

<p>"But when we come to die, it will
be so sad to leave you alone!"</p>

<p>Jeannet started up, and leaned
against the mantel. A clap of thunder
at the time would not have astonished
him more than such a
speech. He to be left alone in the
world, no longer to have his father
and mother beside him! And nevertheless
it was something to be anticipated;
but his life flowed on so
smoothly and happily, the thought
of such a misfortune had never before
struck terror to his heart.</p>

<p>He remained silent a moment,
looking fixedly at the bright wood
fire that burned upon the hearth;
and suddenly, as it often happens
when some remark has penetrated
the very soul, he saw, as in a picture,
his dear good mother Pierrette and
father Ragaud stretched on their
biers, and laid in the cold ground, in
the dread repose of death that never
awakens. But, no! it was not possible;
and yet it happens any day,
sometimes for one, sometimes for another.
Muiceron, where they all lived
in tranquil happiness, was truly
a paradise on earth, but most assuredly
not the celestial paradise where
immortality alone exists.</p>

<p>For the first time since the memorable
day when he had suffered
so cruelly on learning the secret of
his birth, Jeannet felt his poor heart
ache with a similar grief. Pierrette,
who thought it perfectly natural to
have opened his eyes to such a desirable
event, continued her spinning.
Seeing Jean-Louis in deep
thought, and receiving no answer,
she simply fancied her argument had
been conclusive, and that he felt the
necessity of establishing himself, and
so was debating in his own mind the
relative attractions of the girls in the
neighborhood. Besides, Jeannet's
back was to her, and she did not
see the change in his face.</p>

<p>"Think a little," said she, pursuing
her idea; "there is no greater
pleasure for parents who feel themselves
growing old than to see their
children well married. Then they
can die in peace, thinking that, after
they are gone, nothing will be
changed; only, instead of the old
people, young ones will take their
place, the work will go on, all hearts
will be happy, and kind prayers and
fond recollections will follow them
to the tomb."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Jean-Louis, covering
his face with his hands, "if you say
another word, I will die!"</p>

<p>"What!" said Pierrette, "die&mdash;of
what? Are you ill?"</p>

<p>Jeannet, in spite of his twenty
years, burst into tears like a little
child; he clasped Pierrette in his
arms, fondly embraced her, and said
in a tone melting with tenderness:</p>

<p>"My mother, my dear, dear mother,
I shall never marry&mdash;never, do
you hear? And I beg of you never
to mention the subject again. I
have but one heart, and that I have
given you undivided; nothing remains
for another. When you speak of
marriage, it makes us think of death
and the grave; and that is beyond
my strength&mdash;I cannot speak of it.
If the good God calls you before me,
my dearest mother, it will not be
long before I rejoin you; and thus it
will be better for me to die single
than to leave a family after me. And
now, as I do not wish to marry, and
you only desire my happiness, do not
urge me further."</p>

<p>"Your heart is too gentle for a
man," said Pierrette, feeling the tears
of her dear child on her brow; "you
make me happy, even while opposing
me, and I see that I have made you
unhappy without wishing it. Be
consoled, my Jeannet; we will never
speak of it again. If you change your
mind, you will tell me. Meanwhile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
we will live as before. Don't be
worried; it will be a long time yet
before we leave you. I am in good
health, and your father also; and so
Muiceron will not change masters
soon."</p>

<p>"No, no, thank God!" cried Jean-Louis;
"the Blessed Virgin will watch
over us. We have not lived together
for twenty years now to separate, my
darling mother!"</p>

<p>Truth to say, this was not very
sound argument, for, whether twenty
years together, or thirty, or forty,
friends must separate, all the same,
at the appointed hour; but Jeannet
spoke with his heart torn with sorrow,
and Pierrette was perfectly willing to
acknowledge, in her turn, that she
really desired things should happen
as he wished.</p>

<p>From that time the question of
marriage was put in her pocket, and
never taken out again. God and his
holy angels looked down with delight
upon this innocent household, full of
tenderness and kindness, and did not
allow evil to overshadow it. However,
the child Jeannette deserved to
be cured of her little sins of vanity,
and you will see the means taken by
the Heavenly Father to make her a
Christian according to his will.</p>


<h4>XI.</h4>

<p>About this time came a year which
is still remembered, although a good
long time has since elapsed. Swarms
of locusts devoured the young wheat
before it ripened, while the field-mice,
moles, and other villanous pests,
gnawed and destroyed it at the roots.
Corn especially suffered in this unlucky
season; not a plant escaped.
Before it had grown ten feet in height,
it was blighted, and then withered
and died. It would take too long
to enumerate all the difficulties that
overwhelmed the peasants. Hailstorms
beat down the meadows at haymaking
time; splendid cows died of
the pest; sheep were suddenly attacked
and perished; and as for the
horses, decimated by the glanders,
which became epidemic, and was
very dangerous, as it often passed
from animals to men, it would be impossible
to count the victims.</p>

<p>This year, at least, those who had
begun the season by prophesying
evil had their predictions fully accomplished;
but, thank God! such an
unfortunate season rarely happens.
The poor people were fearfully discouraged;
and, in sooth, it was not
strange that men dreaded the future,
in face of such a present.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, greater activity was
never seen in the fields. To save the
little that remained, each one did his
best, even down to the little children,
in reaping, gathering the harvest, piling
the carts, in spite of the locusts,
the hail, and the devil, who was said
to have a great deal to do with the
affair, and which I am very much inclined
to believe. The people even
worked until late in the night. It was
a devouring fever, which made every
one half crazy, and it was a miracle
that no one died of it; for, in our
province, we are accustomed to work
slowly, without hurry or excitement,
and it is commonly believed everything
happens when and how it is
decreed, but none the worse on that
account; but I wish to prove that
they could hurry up when occasion
required.</p>

<p>Our friend, Jean-Louis, did wonders
in these sad circumstances. He
seemed to be everywhere at once&mdash;in
the fields, the stables, at the head of
the reapers, at the barn when the
carts were unloaded; encouraging
some, urging on others, in a friendly
way; hurrying up the cattle; when
necessary, giving a helping hand to
the veterinary surgeon; and, withal,
gentle and kind to everybody.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span></p>

<p>You think that, with order, energy,
and intelligence, work will always be
rewarded with success. He who first
said, "Help yourself, and Heaven
will aid you," did not speak falsely.
God does not work miracles for those
who fold their arms in idleness, but
he always gives to humble and persevering
labor such abundant reward
that, for many centuries, no matter
what may be the suffering, the truth
of the Holy Scriptures has always
been verified, that "never has any
one seen the just man die of hunger,
or his seed begging their bread."</p>

<p>In virtue of this rule, it came to
pass that, at Muiceron, the harvest
of hay, as well as of wheat, rye, and
corn, was far better than could have
been expected by the most sanguine.
The unfortunate ones, who lost nearly
all their crops, said that Ragaud had
dealt in witchcraft to protect himself
from the prevailing bad luck. This
nonsense made every one laugh, but
did not stop their envy and jealousy;
and so unjust do men become, when
their hearts are envenomed by rage
and disappointment, that some of the
worst&mdash;the laziest, undoubtedly&mdash;went
so far as to declare openly, in
the village inn, that it would be for
the good of the public if some of the
splendid hay-stacks at Muiceron were
burned, as the contrast was too great
between the well-kept farm and the
ruined fields around.</p>

<p>Fortunately, our friend, Jacques
Michou, was drinking in a corner
while this delightful conversation
took place; he rose from his seat,
and, placing his hand on the shoulder
of him who had been the loudest in
threats, declared he would instantly
complain of him to the police; and
that, merely for speaking in such a
manner, he could be sent to prison
for a month. No further grumbling
was heard after this speech, and it
can be easily understood no wicked
attempt was made. So true is it
that a little courage will easily defeat
the most wicked plans; for vice is
very cowardly in its nature.</p>

<p>While all the country around Val-Saint,
Ordonniers, and many other
neighborhoods, were thus afflicted,
M. le Marquis had been busy with
some of his grand affairs, of which
we have already heard, and started
on a journey for some unknown
place. He returned this time a little
happier than usual, as it was near the
beginning of 1847; and it is not necessary
to remind you that it preceded
1848. At this time even the stupidest
felt that a revolution was approaching,
and our good lord and all
his friends were doubly certain of
the impending storm. He was therefore
excusable in having neglected
the care of his large estate, so as
to devote himself to that which was
the first desire of his heart. But he
who should have watched over his
interests in his absence, the superintendent
Riponin, he it was that was
every way blamable; for, whether intentionally,
that he might continue
his orgies in the midst of disorder, or
through idleness and negligence, he
had allowed the place to fall into a
fearful state of ruin. Nothing was
to be seen but fields devastated by
the ruin, or grain rotting as it stood;
the animals that died had not been
replaced; and even the vegetable
garden of the château presented a
most lamentable picture of disorder
and neglect. Ragaud and Michou,
had seen all this; but they were too
insignificant to dare say a word, and
too proud, besides, to venture a remonstrance,
which certainly would
not have been received.</p>

<p>M. le Marquis, on his return, was
anything but agreeably surprised.
He summoned Riponin before him,
and reprimanded him in a manner
which he long remembered. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
master was goodness itself, but he
could not be unreasonably imposed
upon; his old noble blood would
fire up, and he could show men that
for more than five hundred years his
ancestors, as well as he, had been
accustomed to command and obey
only the laws of the Lord God.</p>

<p>Riponin was a coward; he trembled
and asked pardon, promised to
do better, and gave a hundred poor
excuses. M. le Marquis would not
receive any such explanation; he ordered
Riponin out of his presence,
and seasoned the command with
several big military words, which I
will not repeat. It was a sign that
he was terribly angry. Thus the unfaithful
steward was obliged to retire
without further reply; and, between
ourselves, it was the best he
could do.</p>

<p>Thereupon M. le Marquis, still in
a fury, sent off for Ragaud, who
came in great haste, easily divining
what had happened.</p>

<p>"Ragaud," said the master, "you
are no better than the rest. I will lose
forty thousand francs on my crops;
and if you had seen to it, this would
not have happened."</p>

<p>"Forty thousand francs!" quietly
replied Ragaud. "I beg your pardon,
M. le Marquis; but you mean sixty
thousand francs, and that, I think, is
the lowest calculation."</p>

<p>M. le Marquis was naturally cheerful;
this unexpected answer made
him smile, instead of increasing his
anger. He looked at his old servant,
whom he highly esteemed, and,
folding his arms, said:</p>

<p>"Is that your opinion? Come,
now, let us say fifty thousand; I think
that is enough."</p>

<p>"No, no, sixty," replied Ragaud.
"I will not take off a crown; but
there is yet time to save half."</p>

<p>"Is that so? What can I give
you, if you do that much?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, M. le Marquis, but
permission to be master here for a
week, and the honor of serving you."</p>

<p>"Old fool!" said the marquis.
"And your own work, what will become
of it?"</p>

<p>"It is all finished," replied the
good farmer; "don't be uneasy, my
dear master, only give me, as I said
before, full power."</p>

<p>"Be off, then. I know your devotion,
and I have full confidence in
you; but you will not object to my
making a present to your children?"</p>

<p>"Presents!" said Ragaud, much
moved. "What else have you done
for the past twenty years, M. le
Marquis? Is it not the least you can
do to let me be of some use to you
for once in my life? I owe everything
to you, down to the roof that
shelters me, my wife, and the children.
Presents! No, no, if you do
not wish to pain me."</p>

<p>"Proud and obstinate man that
you are," said the marquis, smiling,
"have everything your own way. I
am not so proud as you; you offer to
save me thirty thousand francs, and
I don't make such a fuss about accepting
it. Isn't that a present?"</p>

<p>"It is thirty thousand francs that
I will prevent you from losing," said
the obstinate Ragaud.</p>

<p>"Yes, as though one would say
grape-juice was not the juice of the
grape," replied the marquis, who was
highly amused at the replies of his
old servant. "Well, if I ask you to
drink a glass of old Bordeaux with
me, will you take that as the offer of
a present you must refuse?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said Ragaud,
"but it is too great an honor for me
to drink with my lord."</p>

<p>M. le Marquis made them bring
refreshments on a silver waiter, and
kept Ragaud in close conversation
for a full hour, knowing well that
this friendly manner of treating him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
was the greatest reward he could
give the good, honest soul, to whom
God had given sentiments far above
his condition. Afterwards, he dismissed
him with such a warm shake
of the hand that Ragaud was nearly
overcome and could scarcely restrain
his tears.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, returning to Muiceron,
where he found Jean-Louis
occupied with arranging the wood-pile,
"what do you think we are
going to do, my boy, after having
worked like ten men to get in our
crops and fill the barns?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking about that," replied
Jeannet; "and, meanwhile, I
have put the fagots in order, so that
mother can easily get at them, when
I am not at hand, to make the fire."</p>

<p>"You have never thought to take
a little rest?" asked Ragaud, who
knew well beforehand what would
be the reply.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Jean-Louis, "an
hour's rest now and then is very
pleasant; but after that, my dear father,"
he continued, laughing, "I
like to stretch my legs."</p>

<p>"Well, then, let us imagine nothing
was done at Muiceron, and
that, at this very moment, we should
be obliged to begin; what would you
say?"</p>

<p>"All right; and I would instantly
begin the work. I hope you don't
doubt me?" he replied, with his
usual air of quiet resolution.</p>

<p>"No, I do not doubt you, my
good boy," resumed Ragaud; "and
to prove my confidence in your
courage and good-will, I have to-day
promised to undertake an enterprise
which, in honor, we are bound to
accomplish."</p>

<p>And he related to him what we
already know.</p>

<p>"Hum!" said Jean-Louis, after
having listened attentively; "it will
be pretty hard work, but with the
help of God nothing is impossible."</p>

<p>"That is just what I think," replied
Ragaud; "but for that, I would
not have undertaken such a task.
Now, Jeannet, we must begin to put
the place in order to-morrow at the
latest."</p>

<p>"That will be time enough, father,
and we will do our best," said Jean-Louis.</p>

<p>The subject was dropped for the
rest of the evening. Ragaud did not
trouble his head about the means his
son would employ; and Jeannet, without
being otherwise sure of himself, remained
tranquil, like all those who
ask the assistance of divine Providence
in the management of their affairs.
Nevertheless, it was a difficult
task, not only on account of the
severe manual labor, but also from
the certainty of incurring the deadly
hatred of Riponin, who was a very
wicked man. The thought of it
somewhat disquieted Ragaud, and
Jean-Louis from the first understood
the full danger; but what could be
done? Duty before everything.</p>

<p>The next morning Jean-Louis
was up before sunrise. During the
night, he thought over his plan, like
the general of an army; he remembered
having read somewhere that
a troop can do nothing, unless conducted
by able chiefs. He would
need one hundred hands, and, for
one all alone, that would be a great
many. His first care was to knock
at the window of a fine young man
of his own age, who, from infancy,
had been his most intimate friend.
He was called Pierre Luguet, and
lived in the hamlet of Luchonières,
which is a small cluster of twelve or
fifteen houses a little lower down
than Ordonniers, but on the other
side of La Range. By good fortune,
the stream at this place is so choked
up with a big heap of gravel and old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
stumps of willow-trees, which serve
as stepping-stones across the water,
that any one who is light-footed can
cross as easily as on a narrow bridge.</p>

<p>This name of Luguet, I suppose,
strikes your ear oddly. He was
really the nephew of poor Catharine,
and thus first cousin of Jean-Louis,
who undoubtedly knew it, as
you can imagine. Perhaps it was
the reason these two young men
were so much attached. They say
the voice of blood cannot be smothered;
and although it is not always
true, in this case it was very evident
that, whether for that reason or simply
from similarity of character and
pursuits, good conduct and age,
Pierre Luguet was the only one of
the neighborhood whom Jeannet
ever sought, and that Pierre was
never happier than when he could
detain Jean-Louis for several hours
in conversation or some innocent
amusement.</p>

<p>Jean-Louis went straight to the
house of his friend, who, recognizing
his voice behind the shutter, quickly
opened it and let him in. He lived
in a little room in front of the
farm-buildings, and, consequently, the
noise did not awaken his parents.
Jeannet entered by the window, and,
without losing any time, explained
his plans to Pierre, while he rapidly
dressed.</p>

<p>"You," said he, "must be my lieutenant.
We must get together one
hundred young men, each one resolved
to do his part. M. le Marquis
will not begrudge the crowns;
we will promise them good wages,
and they must work all night, if necessary;
and, to encourage every one,
we will keep a roaring fire in Michou's
house, so that Barbette will always
have the soup warm and a tun of
cider ready for tapping. In this manner
the laborers will be contented, and
not obliged to return home twice a-day
for their meals. As for you, Pierre,
be assured that M. le Marquis will
reward you most generously for your
work; and, besides, you will be doing
a good action, for it is a great sin to
see the estate of the master worse
cared for than that of his servants."</p>

<p>"I am not thinking about the
price," said Pierre Luguet, putting
on his blouse. "I ask no more than
you will have."</p>

<p>"That is good; we will see about
it," replied Jeannet, laughing in his
sleeve; for he knew well that he was
going to work for the honor of it, and
he did not wish to make Pierre go
by the same rule, knowing that he
supported his old parents.</p>

<p>They decided upon the places
where they would expect to find the
best men, and separated, one to the
left, the other to the right, promising
to meet again at twelve o'clock.</p>

<p>There was really great rejoicing
when the young men of Val-Saint
and Ordonniers learned that they
were required to work for M. le Marquis
under the lead of the two best
men of the neighborhood. They had
nothing to fear from brutality and
injustice, as in the time of Riponin;
and the news of his disgrace put all
the brave fellows in the best humor.</p>

<p>Riponin was cordially detested, and
for double the pay not one would
have volunteered to serve under him,
or have undertaken such a disagreeable
and bungled affair; but with Jeannet
it was another thing, and although
he warned them beforehand that
he would allow neither idleness nor
bad language, and that they must
work long and steadily, they followed
him, singing as joyously as though
they were going to a wedding.</p>

<p>Before noon, the two bands met
on the edge of the wood, where
dwelt our old friend, the game-keeper.
Pierre Luguet, after leaving
home, had taken care to pass by, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
as to forewarn him. Jacques Michou
threw up his cap at the news; he
also despised Riponin, and, more than
any other, he had good reason for
hating him. He therefore laid his
plans, and borrowed from the château
a huge kettle, such as is used
during the vintage for pressing the
grapes, which he put up, for their
service, in his little barn. Everything
was ready at the appointed
hour, and I can assure you the delightful
surprise was fully appreciated
by our young friends. The two leaders
had taken the precaution to tell
each one of the boys to bring half a
loaf of bread, a piece of goat's cheese,
and a slice of pork; so the soup was
doubly welcome, as it was not expected,
and the cider still more so,
as they had counted only on the river-water.
This good beginning put
them in splendid humor; and when,
after being fully refreshed, they
marched up to the château to pay
their respects to M. le Marquis before
beginning their work, one would
have said, from the noise and singing,
that it was a band of conscripts
who had drawn the lucky number.</p>

<p>They instantly put their shoulders
to the plough. Jeannet wisely made
them commence with the worst fields,
so that, when the first excitement
was over, and they would be rather
fatigued, they could find that they
had not eaten the white bread first.
Thus, having been well selected, well
fed, well paid, and, above all, well
led, our boys did wonders, not only
that afternoon, but on the following
days. The weather, however, was
decidedly against them; rain drenched
the laborers, and strong winds
prevented them from building up the
hay-stacks; but their ardor was so
great that nothing discouraged them;
and often, when Jeannet, moved by
sympathy, put it to vote whether
they should continue or not, he saw
with pleasure that not one man deserted
his post.</p>

<p>At the end of a week, half the
work was so well under way it could
easily be seen that, in spite of the
bad season and worse management,
M. le Marquis would not lose all his
crops this time, but that, on the contrary,
his barns would make a very
good show, if not in quality, at least
in quantity. The worthy gentleman
came several times himself to visit
the laborers and distribute extra pay.
On these occasions it was admirable
to see the modesty of Jean-Louis,
who always managed to disappear,
leaving to Pierre Luguet the honor
of showing the progress of the work
to M. le Marquis; and as workmen
are generally just when they are not
found fault with, brow-beaten, or ill-treated,
they rendered to Jean-Louis
greater honor and respect the more
he concealed himself from their applause.
In short, everything went
on well to the end without interruption.</p>

<p>The given fortnight was not over
when the last cart-load, ornamented
on top with a huge bouquet of flowers
and sheaves of wheat tied with
ribbons, was conducted in triumph,
accompanied with songs of joy, under
the windows of mademoiselle, who
appeared on the balcony, with Jeannette
Ragaud on her right and Dame
Berthe on the left. M. le Marquis
was in the court of honor, enchanted
with the success of the measure; and
Ragaud and Michou could not remain
quiet, but clapped their hands,
and cried "Bravo!" to the brave
young men.</p>

<p>Jean-Louis tried to escape this
time also, but was not allowed. His
friends raised him in their arms, and
placed him on top of the cart with
his good comrade, Pierre Luguet;
and thus they made their appearance,
both standing alongside of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
bouquet, Jeannet crimson with shame
and vexation, whilst Pierre sang loud
enough to crack his throat.</p>

<p>You can imagine that this cart,
upon which had been heaped the
last gleanings of the harvest, was
piled up immensely high, so that the
top was on a level with the first floor
of the château, and mademoiselle
could thus converse at her ease with
the young men.</p>

<p>She spoke most graciously to Jean-Louis,
and congratulated him with
words so complimentary that the
poor fellow wished himself under the
grain, rather than on top. What
embarrassed him still further was to
see his sister Jeannette playing the
part of great lady as much as her
mistress. With his usual good sense,
he considered it out of place, and
would have been much better pleased
if she had appeared ill at ease in her
false position; but, far from that, she
leaned over the balcony, laughing and
talking like a vain little parrot, and
even rallied Jean-Louis on his subdued
manner.</p>

<p>He did not wish to spoil the affair
by looking severe and discontented,
but he was grieved at heart, and
hastened to put an end to the scene.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle, at the close of her
complimentary remarks, presented
each of the two friends with a little
box of the same size, wrapped in
beautiful paper, and tied with pink
ribbon.</p>

<p>"They are filled with bonbons,"
said she in her sweet, gentle voice;
"and you will not refuse to eat them
in remembrance of me?"</p>

<p>Then she made them a most
friendly bow, which they returned
with great respect, and the big cart
was driven off to the barn to be unloaded.</p>

<p>"Bon-bons!" said Pierre to Jeannet,
taking out his box after they
had descended from their high post
of honor. "What do you think, Jean-Louis?
It seems to me this plaything
is too heavy only to contain
candies."</p>

<p>"At any rate," replied Jean-Louis,
"they can't do us any harm, as the
boxes are not very large."</p>

<p>They quickly untied the pretty
pink ribbon, and found in Pierre's
box fifteen bright twenty-franc
pieces, while Jeannet's contained a
beautiful gold watch, with a chain
of equal value.</p>

<p>To add to the general happiness, the
sky, which until then had been cloudy
as though threatening rain, suddenly
cleared, and the sun went down in
the full splendor of August, and shed
a brilliant light over the bare fields,
as Jean-Louis was carried in triumph
by his comrades, who cried out that
surely he controlled the weather, as
the very winds seemed to obey him;
and, strange as it may appear, the season
continued so fine that never was
there a more delightful autumn than
after the unfortunate spring and summer.</p>

<p>If I dared express my opinion, I
would tell you that, without calling it
miraculous, the good God scarcely
ever fails to send joy after sorrow,
peace after war, heat after cold, as
much to the visible things of the
earth as to the secret ones of the
heart. It is, therefore, well not to
throw the handle too quickly after
the axe; and, to prove this, I will tell
you a short and true story, which I
just happen to remember.</p>

<p>It relates to Michel Levrot, of
the commune of Saint-Ouaire, who,
against everybody's advice, married
a woman from near Bichérieux.
She was a bad Christian and totally
unworthy of the good little man, who
was rather too gentle and weak in
character. For a year they got along
so-so, without any great disturbance;
but gradually the wicked creature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
grew to despise her poor husband,
for no other reason but that he was
too good for her, and let her have
her own way completely. She wasted
money at fairs, bought more fine
clothes and silver jewelry than she
knew what to do with, kept up a row
in the house from morning until night,
and ended by being nearly always
drunk; all which made Michel
Levrot so unhappy that one sad day
in a moment of despair, without
stopping to think of his eternal salvation,
he threw himself headlong into
the river Coussiau, which, fortunately,
was not so deep as La Range, although
nearly as wide.</p>

<p>As he was out of his head, and
acted without thinking, his good
angel most assuredly took care of
him; for, if he had been drowned, he
certainly would have lost his soul;
but, although he did not know how
to swim, he floated on his back, and
the current carried him to the bank
of the stream, where he was picked
up, half-dead and in a swoon, by
some of the neighbors, who rubbed
and warmed him, and managed to
bring him back to life. Those who
had saved him were good, pious men,
who spoke to him in such a Christian
manner, they made him feel
ashamed of his cowardice and want
of confidence in the Heavenly Father;
so he promised to go and see our
<i lang="fr">curé</i>, who lifted him upon his beast&mdash;that
is to say, made peace enter his
soul; after which he explained to
him that, having no children, he had
the right to leave this wicked and
perverse woman, who deserved a
severe lesson, and not return home
until she should be converted or
dead.</p>

<p>He left that part of the country,
entirely cured of his desire to kill
himself, and made the tour of France,
honestly earning his bread by working
at his trade, which was that of
an upholsterer. From time to time
the neighbors sent him news of his
abominable wife, who led such a
scandalous life it was easy to predict
she would not make old bones;
for, if strong drink and vice soon
kill the most robust men, they are
still more fatal to women. After
a few years, he received the welcome
intelligence that his house was rid
of its baneful mistress. He then returned
to Saint-Ouaire, and was charitable
enough to give fifty francs for
Masses for the unfortunate soul.
Some time after, he married the
daughter of Pierre Rufin, a good
worker and housekeeper, who, besides
other excellent qualities, never drank
anything stronger than honey and
water that she took for a weak stomach,
which she had from childhood.
They lived most happily, and
had a family of five handsome children.
I knew him when he was very
old, and he always loved to relate
this story of his youth, never failing
to return thanks to the good God, who
had saved him from drowning.</p>

<p>"For," said he, "my dear children,
if I had been drowned that day from
want of a little patience, I should
have lost my soul, besides the good
wife you see here and all my present
happiness."</p>

<h3>ONE CHAPTER FROM HESTER HALLAM'S LIFE.</h3>


<p>"Ah! Hester, Hester, keep back
your tears. Be the brave little wife
and woman now. Have faith, hope,
and courage; the year will soon
speed by, and, lo! here shall I find
you again! God grant it! And good-by,
my wife, my children&mdash;my all
and only treasures."</p>

<p>They are engraven on my memory&mdash;these
last words of Henry Hallam,
my husband, my beloved. They
were spoken hopefully, cheerfully,
though I knew they were intended
to cover the sorrow of a heart that
ached, even as did mine, at our final
parting.</p>

<p>Henry Hallam was to go to South
America as chief engineer of a proposed
road from some inland city
to the Pacific. After a marriage of
eight years, this was our first separation.
I never did consent to it. Better
poverty and the humblest life together
than that mountains and seas
should divide us, I argued.</p>

<p>But Henry was proud, as he was
tender and loving; he could not bear
to see his wife, delicately reared, doing
menial service; nor his little girls
deprived of waxen dolls, because
they would usurp the ragged dollar
that must go for bread.</p>

<p>Our situation had fallen from bad
to worse; an expensive lawsuit had
been decided against us, to liquidate
the cost of which an out-West piece
of land, that was to have been our
children's fortune, had to be sold at
a sacrifice; and when all was paid,
except our scanty furniture, we had
but three hundred dollars in the
world. We lived in a rented house
in the beautiful suburbs of Brooklyn;
three months' rent would consume
our all. Meantime, upon what should
we live, and wherewithal should we
be clothed? This was a serious question,
which vexed my husband for
many days. He suddenly answered
it by accepting with alacrity this lucrative
position in South America.
My only living relative in all America
was one sister, widowed and
childless. She came from the West
to abide with me during my husband's
absence. She, too, had comparative
poverty for her dowry, her
only income arising from the interest
of less than a thousand dollars.</p>

<p>No thought of poverty haunted us,
however; heretofore all our wants
had been supplied, and we had lived
almost luxuriously, counting upon
the fortune which had been for six
years dwindling to less and less in
courts of law.</p>

<p>It was with no dread of poverty, I
repeat, that I saw my husband take
his departure. I thought only how
the light had gone from our house,
and joy from existence. I am distressed
whenever I read of the ever-recurring
matrimonial quarrels and
divorces which appear now the order
of the day. I could have lived with
Henry Hallam through the countless
eternal years, and&mdash;God forgive me!&mdash;desired
no other heaven.</p>

<p>We had no particular creed or
faith. The Hallams had been Methodists;
the Griffeths, my father's
family over in Wales, had been members
of the Church of England.</p>

<p>Henry and I, reading here and
there indifferently, had become somewhat
inclined to Swedenborg's theories.
We read Dr. Bushnell and
his colleagues with some faith and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
more interest. But we fashioned the
great hereafter&mdash;the heaven we all
talk of and dream so much of&mdash;after
our own ideals. Those may have
been in the right, thought we, from
whom Shelley and many another
poetical dreamer imbibed the idea
that the Godhead was but the universal
spirit pervading and animating
nature; that man was immortal, and
was to arise from the dead, clothed in
purity and beauty, and was to wander
endlessly in some limitless, enchanting
paradise, where should be all things
lovely to charm the eye, all sounds
to entrance the ear, all spirits gentle,
and wise, and good for communion
of intellect and heart. In this heaven
stood no stately throne upon
which sat a God of justice, receiving
one unto life, banishing another unto
everlasting perdition. It was the
same here as upon earth; the beauty,
bloom, fragrance, and glory were
permeated with an essence subtle,
invisible, intangible, but present,
the life and source of all&mdash;and this
was God! The ancients had a heaven
and a hell, which Christianity
had adopted; but we lived in the
XIXth century, and we need not pin
our faith to such notions borrowed
from the heathen. Were youth and
health on earth immortal, we would
prefer never to pass through the iron
gate of death and the pearly gate
of life; since, however, all must yield
to the inexorable fiat, and <em>all men
must die</em>, we would make a virtue of
necessity, and be willing to go to
that sensual heaven, which wore all
the beauty of earth, with naught of
its thorns and blight. Ah! we, Henry
and I, were still in the glow of
youth and hope; life seemed a beautiful
vista, and the end far off! Of
the great beyond we but carelessly
dreamed&mdash;as carelessly as if our feet
were never there to stand, nor our
souls to tremble upon its awful brink.</p>

<p>With Henry gone, I was like a
child bereft of its mother. I wept
and would not be comforted. I
counted the hours of every day;
they seemed so inconsiderable, deducted
from the almost nine thousand
which the three hundred and sixty-five
days yielded. I see now how
foolish, weak, and wicked I was!</p>

<p>I was seized with a slow fever, which
lasted me through the summer. In
my weakness and wakefulness I saw
visions and dreamed dreams which
haunted me constantly. I began to
fancy that I was to die. I would
have been satisfied to have fallen in
a sleep that should have known no
waking until the dread year was
over.</p>

<p>Early in September I heard from
my room an unusual bustle in the
house&mdash;the feet of men, and the
unwonted sound of boxes or trunks
laid heavily upon the floor. But
why need I go into details?</p>

<p>Henry Hallam had died of yellow
fever, and his trunks had been sent
home!</p>

<p>In my despair, one thought overpowered
me. I had made myself
wretched counting over the hours
until Henry should return. Now he
would never, never come back, no
matter how many hours; I might
count for an eternity, and he would
not come at the end. Oh! could
he but some time come, even in the
distant years, when his step was feeble
and his hair was gray, how patient
I would be, how hopeful, cheerful,
in the waiting for that certain
time!</p>

<p><em>Why</em> had I not been happy when
I knew that he still lived; when the
fond hope was mine that, after a few
months, I should again behold him?</p>

<p>We never know&mdash;alas! we never
know! With my beloved gone, I
fancied myself sunk in the lowest
depth of desolation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span></p>

<p>More than two years elapsed. My
sister struggled bravely to keep a
roof above our heads and the wolf
of hunger from our door. Notwithstanding
her closest economy, untiring
industry, and fertile ingenuity,
her small principal had become reduced
one-half. Her zeal and energy
were a reproach to me, and I had already
commenced heroic endeavors
to imitate and assist her. We might
still have done well, educated my
two little girls, and taken comfort in
each other, now that my hopeless
grief had become partially assuaged,
and I had begun to take an interest
in the management of our affairs. A
fresh grief, however, was in store for
me. Maria, my sister, upon whom
alone I had come to depend, was
stricken with an incurable disease,
and, after lingering through months
of pain, which often amounted to
torture, died, and was buried.</p>

<p>I was not allowed to remain in my
stupor of grief after I had beheld the
cruel grave close over my only sister.
The fact that but a trifle remained
after all expenses had been paid
aroused me to most painful apprehensions
for the fate of my children. But
for them I fully believe I should have
adopted the advice of his friends to
Job, the patient&mdash;curse God, and die!</p>

<p>The dear little children, however,
who had no friends but their unhappy
mother, and who clung to me as if
they had in me all that was sufficient
and all the world, were an incentive
to further endurance and fresh exertion.</p>

<p>In a moment of discouragement
and gloom I wrote an unaccustomed
letter of six pages to a lady who had
been my friend while sojourning in
the West. I had spent a year with
my husband in a growing village
upon the banks of the Mississippi
where this lady resided. She had a
delightful home in the midst of
charming grounds, an indulgent, devoted
husband, three lovely children,
with wealth enough to command the
desirable and good things of this
world. We had corresponded for a
time, but since my great affliction I
had written no letters.</p>

<p>Without delay came Mrs. Bell's reply.
In my selfish grief I had not
thought that upon others also might
be falling showers of the self-same
woe. The thought of Mrs. Bell, with
her happy surroundings, had formed
a pleasant picture, comforting to dwell
upon. Ah! how my eyes filled and
my heart throbbed as I read her
letter!</p>

<p>The beautiful home, with its pictures,
books, its nameless household
gods, was in ashes; the husband,
really the handsomest, most elegant
gentleman I have ever met, full of
health, vigor, and cheerfulness, a year
after the fatal fire had died suddenly,
leaving his large property in an involved
and unavailable condition;
and my friend was living in a small
cottage amidst the ashes and blackened
trunks of trees&mdash;which stood
like weird spectres about her former
home. The letter, half read, fell from
my nerveless grasp, and I clasped
tightly my trembling hands, bowing
down upon them my throbbing head,
murmuring:</p>

<p>"Doth <em>all</em> of beauty fade to blight,
and all of joy to gloom? Are <em>all</em>
human loves so vain and transient?
Are all hopes and dreams fleeting
and unsubstantial as the goodly
shadow of a summer cloud? Is it
true of <em>all</em> beneath the sun, 'ashes
to ashes, dust to dust'?" Gathering
courage to finish the letter, another
surprise awaited me. My friend had
become a Roman Catholic. After
giving brief details of her conversion,
she thus addressed me:</p>

<p>"At this moment I feel more sorrow
for you than for myself. My dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>est
earthly loves and hopes lie, like
yours, in ashes. But out of <em>my</em> desolation
hath sprung the green branches
of heavenly peace. I weep not
unavailing tears at the loss of what
so charmed my heart as to separate
my soul from God. Arise out of the
ashes watered with your tears. Go
to the nearest Catholic priest; ask
him for books, counsel, and prayer
that shall lead you upward and onward
toward the kingdom of rest.
Make the effort, I entreat you, in the
name of God. If you find no peace
to your soul, what will you have
lost? If you find comfort and rest,
will not all have been gained?"</p>

<p>Had I learned, in the midst of my
happiness, that Miriam Bell had become
a Catholic, I might have wondered,
thought strange of it, but set
it down as one of the unaccountable
things, and not puzzled my brain by
studying into it. But now it was
different. Her afflictions, so similar
to my own, brought her very near to
me in sympathy. I would have as
soon thought of myself becoming deluded
by the snares of Popery as my
friend, Mrs. Bell. Yea, sooner; she
was more matter-of-fact, calm, philosophical,
more highly educated, with
a mind more thoroughly disciplined,
and naturally more inquiring and
comprehensive than my own. And
she had heartily embraced this religious
faith which, without ever having
bestowed much thought upon, I
had naturally regarded as one of superstitions
and lies.</p>

<p>The sun went down, the twilight
fell. Charlotte and Cora helped
themselves to a slice of bread, and
lay down to rest. The sewing-machine
had for hours been idle, and
the unfinished white shirt, suspended
by the needle, looked like a ghost in
the gathering gloom; and still I
held my hands and deeply thought,
or walked the floor with stilly tread.</p>

<p>And so Miriam Bell had found a
balm for her sorrow, a light amid her
darkness. How? By becoming a
Catholic. And what was it to become
a Catholic? To believe impossibilities,
and to worship idols;
to behold, in a tiny wafer of human
manufacture, the body and blood,
soul and divinity, of an incarnate
God? Does Miriam Bell believe
this? If she can believe it with all
her heart and soul, then might she
well be comforted! To fall upon
one's knees before the relics of a
saint, and beg his prayers, as if he
could see and hear? To implore
the Blessed Virgin to succor and defend,
as if she were not a creature,
but omnipotent and divine? To
reverence the priest as a being immaculate,
an angel with hidden
wings walking upon earth, unto
whose feet you must kneel, and unveil,
as unto God, all the thoughts
and interests of your heart? I pondered
over this last suggestion.
Standing in the white moonlight
that silvered a space of the floor,
I lifted up both weary heart and
waiting hands, and, with eyes toward
the unknown and infinite, I
cried:</p>

<p>"Unto God would I pour forth the
sins and sorrows of my soul; but I
am all unworthy. He whom I have
disregarded and failed to acknowledge
is shut out from my vision and
approach. Between him and me is
the thick wall of my offences. Oh! if,
in his infinite mercy, he could send
forth one little less than an angel&mdash;who
should have something of the
human, that he might compassionate
and pity; of the divine, that he might
comprehend, guide, and assist&mdash;to
that one I might yield in reverence.
All the sins, and follies, and rebellions
of my life should be poured into his
ear; perhaps, oh! perhaps the hand
of such an one might lift me into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
light, if light there be indeed for soul
so dyed as mine."</p>

<p>How this fancied being, uniting the
human and angelic, became gradually,
and by slow degrees, associated in
my mind with the Catholic priest, I
know not. Certain only I am that,
after a few days of mental struggle, of
resolve and counter-resolution, I complied
with my friend's entreaty, and,
accompanied by my little girls, sought
the nearest priest.</p>

<p>I took this step not with faith, nor
yet altogether with doubt. I went,
not willingly, but as if irresistibly impelled.
I was like one shipwrecked&mdash;floating
in maddened waters, threatened
death below, an angry sky
above, and darkness everywhere. A
friend in whom I trusted had pointed
out to me a life-preserver.</p>

<p>"Stretch forth thy hand, hold it
fast; it will save thee," she had said.</p>

<p>"It is but a straw," I murmured,
clutching at it, drowning.</p>

<p>The priest entered the parlor a few
moments after our admission by a
domestic.</p>

<p>I scanned him narrowly as he
walked straight up to us, rubbing
one hand against the other, slightly
elevating his shoulders. He was a
middle-aged man, whose benevolent
countenance wore the reflection of a
happy, cheerful soul at peace with
God and man.</p>

<p>My first thought on viewing him
was of the woman who wished but to
"touch the hem of our Saviour's garment";
and, when he uttered his
first salutation: "And what can I
do for you, my child?" I said involuntarily:
"Oh! that I may be made
whole."</p>

<p>"Ah! you would go to confession.
Go into the church, and pray before
the altar; I will be there presently."
And he turned to leave the room.</p>

<p>I did not speak nor move. At the
door he said:</p>

<p>"You are a stranger in the city?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;yes&mdash;that is, I have lived
here several years, but I have no
friends; I am indeed a stranger."</p>

<p>"You understand and attend to
your religious duties?"</p>

<p>"I have no religious duties; I have
no particular religion. I am beginning
to think myself a heathen."</p>

<p>"And have you not been brought
up a Catholic?" he questioned in
surprise, returning to where I still
sat.</p>

<p>"The furthest from it. If you
have time to listen, I will tell you
what has brought me to you." And I
went on to tell him of the advice of
my friend, received in the depth of
my afflictions and despair. If my
conversion to the Catholic faith, entire,
absolute, blessed, thanks be to
God! was not instantaneous; if, being
blind, I received not sight, being
deaf, I received not hearing, in a
moment, in the twinkling of an eye,
as did those whom Christ himself
touched and healed, still do I believe
it to have been the work of Almighty
God, and marvellous unto my own
eyes. If God commissioned Miriam
Bell, instead of his own holy angel, to
direct me to the priest of his own
anointing, I believe myself no less
to have been sent to pious F. Corrigan
than was Paul sent to Annanias,
or Cornelius to Simon.</p>

<p>From regrets and lamentations,
from dulness and despair, my heart
bowed low unto God in rejoicing and
thanksgiving.</p>

<p>Aside from this, the Catholic religion
and the history of the church
became to me an attractive, fascinating
study. I seemed philosophizing
with sages, praying with religious,
meditating with saints. The whole
world seemed newly peopled, unnumbered
voices joining in that grand
chant that the church for almost
nineteen centuries hath sung: "Glo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>ry
be unto God, and on earth peace
to men of good-will."</p>

<p>F. Corrigan had sent a young
priest to a new town in the interior,
made by the opening up of new railroads.
Here F. McDevitt had built
a small church, and, in his report to
his superior, spoke of having need
of a teacher for a parish school. F.
Corrigan offered me the situation, and
in one week I was at Dillon's Station.</p>

<p>On the first day of our arrival, F.
McDevitt asked my eldest little girl
her name.</p>

<p>"Charlotte Griffeth Hallam," she
replied promptly.</p>

<p>"Charlotte Griffeth?" he repeated;
then turning to me:</p>

<p>"And for whom was she named?"</p>

<p>"For my mother," I replied.</p>

<p>"And is your mother living?"</p>

<p>"She died in my infancy."</p>

<p>"She must have been the person
advertised." And taking a slip of
paper from his memorandum-book,
handed it me.</p>

<p>It was an advertisement for Charlotte
Griffeth or her heirs in America,
to whom an estate in Wales had
descended, valued at one hundred
thousand pounds! And what interest
had this possessed for F. McDevitt?
His brother had a short time
previously married a Miss Griffeth,
and it was to send in a letter to his
brother that he had extracted from
the paper this brief paragraph. Was
not this too much? I closed my eyes
to keep back the tears, and pressed
my hand against my side, to still the
tumultuous throbbings of my heart.</p>

<p>God! my God! so long time from
me hidden, giving me now the true
faith, and then this unexpected fortune!
What should I do with it?
A few months before, I would have
purchased a splendid house, perfect
in all its appointments. I would
have gathered about me all that
would have pleased the taste and
gratified the senses.</p>

<p>Now was it thrown in my way
as a temptation? Before the sun
had set upon this wondrous change
of fortune, my decision was formed.
I would go on in the way I had intended.
It had evidently been God's
way chosen for me, and I would follow
in it. I would go into a temporary
cabin, and teach the children
of the Irish laborers.</p>

<p>The fortune should be divided
into three shares. My children
should have two; the third, which
was mine, should go to build a home
for widows and orphans.</p>

<p>And I? Every morning, with my
troop of little girls and boys, I go to
the holy sacrifice of the Mass, where
adoration is perpetually blended with
thanksgiving&mdash;the latter one of the
deepest emotions of my heart. I never
expected to be so content and happy
in this world.</p>

<p>Through thee I have found, O
God! that "thou art the fountain of
all good, the height of life, and the
depth of wisdom. Unto thee do I
lift up mine eyes; in thee, O my God!
Father of mercies, do I put my
trust.</p>

<p>"Bless and sanctify my soul with
heavenly benediction, that it may be
made thy holy habitation and the
seat of thy eternal glory; and let
nothing be found in the temple of thy
divinity that may offend the eyes of
thy majesty!"</p>

<h3>AN ENGLISH CHRISTMAS STORY.</h3>


<h4>I.</h4>

<p>The winter wind is howling over
the bleak moor, and Christmas is
ushered in with a sore famine that
has already made many a hearth
desolate. The stout-hearted folk of
Yorkshire have borne it well up to
this, but the recurrence of the especial
festival of good cheer makes their
lot seem harder in December than it
did two months before. On these
Northern moors are scattered many
Catholics, whose family traditions
point to unknown martyrs as their
ancestors, and whose honest pride in
their forefathers is as strong as that
of the descendants of the cavalier
families. But though there may be
famine and wretchedness on the
moor, there is a worse squalor in the
town. There no helping hand comes
from the "Hall," bearing relief and
consolation; the hovels and tall, crazy
tenements are full to the brim of unknown
human misery; and, for the
poor, Christmas this year means little
less than starvation. Those were not
the days of subscription-lists, benefit
societies, soup-kitchens, and clothing-clubs;
spiritual and temporal relief
were both scarcer than they are now,
and the wars of the previous twenty
years had made people button their
pockets tight and repeat the axiom
that "charity begins at home."</p>

<p>Through the manufacturing town
of Weston, on a chill Christmas eve
in the early part of this century,
walked a thoughtful, almost middle-aged
man, wrapped in a rich furred
cloak, and preceded by a youth bearing
a lantern. He had first left the
town-hall, where he had assisted at
a political meeting, and heard a few
pompous speeches hung upon the
scantiest may-pole of facts. While
these worthies had been declaiming,
thought he, how many poor men,
out of employment, uncared for by
their pastors, must have been murmuring
or swearing at their ill-luck
and the apathy of their superiors!
How many might be driven to crime
or suicide by their wretched circumstances!
He had heard that the Dissenters
helped their poor rather more
effectually than the "church" people
did; and, luckily, in a manufacturing
population there were always
plenty of Dissenters! The Catholics,
too, about whose "emancipation"
there had been so much said lately
in the Whig meetings, were generally
a charitable set, and there
were more of them in the North
than anywhere else in the kingdom;
but they were mostly country people,
and the great houses had enough
to do to support their own village
poor. Could not something be done
on a generous scale by the talkative
municipality of the town? Should
he suggest something to that effect?
But he was only a visitor and traveller,
and had but little interest with
the magnates of Weston. General
knowledge there was none at that
time; and it mattered nothing to the
local authorities here that he had
travelled in the East, was a professor
of ancient history in a French university,
and corresponded with half
the <i lang="fr">savants</i> of Europe. To the insular
mind of a trading community,
he was a mere nameless atom of humanity,
whose doings only concerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
Weston as far as the paying of his
reckoning at the inn, and his consumption
of the most costly items
that the scarcity of the times rendered
a fair source of profit to the landlord.</p>

<p>As he was sunk in these half-derisive
thoughts, he was suddenly accosted
by a man, whose figure, as far
as the light of the lantern revealed it,
was the very reverse of a highwayman.
He had a pistol, however, and
held it threateningly to the gentleman's
heart. In a hollow, unsteady
voice he quickly asked:</p>

<p>"Sir, hand me your money; you
know what I can do, if you refuse, and
I see you are unarmed."</p>

<p>The man's manner contrasted
strangely with his present occupation.
He was no experienced robber,
that was evident; and his eyes
rolled from side to side like those of
a hunted animal. Our friend, who
called himself Prof. John Stamyn,
very quietly replied:</p>

<p>"My good friend, you have come
to the wrong man. You will have
no great booty from me. I have only
three guineas about me, which are
not worth a scuffle; so much good
may you do with them. But you
are in a bad way."</p>

<p>The man did not answer or recriminate.
Hanging his head and lowering
his pistol (an useless weapon
enough, since the trigger was broken
off and the barrel was cracked), he
took the money offered him, and
moved quickly away. Mr. Stamyn
stood looking thoughtfully after him,
then he said to the youth:</p>

<p>"Mind, James, and watch that
man carefully, that he may not be
aware of you; but be careful to see
him housed, and bring me word of
everything." And shaking his head,
as if in pity, he walked back alone to
his hotel.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the boy, proud of his
mission, cautiously started on his pursuit
of the seeming robber. Many a
time he had to darken his lantern
with his cloak, or flatten himself
against doors, as the man he pursued
turned round, glancing fearfully behind,
and then, mending his pace,
hurried on again with unsteady footsteps.
Once he paused before a
large, brightly lighted shop. Loaves
and cakes of all shapes were piled in
the window; but behind the counter
sat two resolute-looking men, whose
expression, as they gazed on the hungry
face outside, was certainly the
reverse of encouraging. The poor
wayfarer turned away with a sigh,
and dived down a side street. Squalid
little booths alternated with equally
squalid dwelling-houses along the
sides of the alley, and grim, fierce,
animal faces gathered in evil-looking
clusters round the doors. The poor
wretch hastened on; apparently none
knew him, as the boy, who followed
him, noticed that no one paid any
attention to him. At last he stopped
at a baker's shop&mdash;a dirty place, very
different from the respectable one he
had looked into so wistfully before.
The boy waited at a convenient distance,
and, by skilfully shading his
lantern, remained there unperceived.
There was no light, save what came
from the shop&mdash;a dull flare at best.
After a few minutes, the man came
out, carrying a large brown loaf of
the cheapest kind that was then sold
in Weston. He now entered another
street, and turned various corners,
so that it was like threading a labyrinth
to follow him. The youth then
saw him disappear in the door-way
of a tall, dilapidated house. The
door was open, and hung awry from
one rusty hinge; a nauseous smell
greeted the nostrils, and shrill, disagreeable
voices were heard in some
up-stairs roost. The man began to
scale the rickety steps, one or two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
of which were missing here and
there, and made a break-neck gap
for the undoing of careless climbers.
Each landing-place seemed more
disreputable than the last, until the
fourth was reached. It required a
good deal of ingenuity in Mr. Stamyn's
messenger to creep unperceived up
these dangerous ladders, never startling
the man he followed, and, above
all, never helping himself along by the
tell-tale light, whose radiance might
have betrayed him. At last the poor
"robber" entered a room, bare of
any apology for furniture, and unlighted,
save by the frosty rays of the
moon. The wind whistled through
it, crevices in the wall there were
plenty, and not one pane of glass
in the grimy window was whole.
The boy crouched outside, and listened.
A crevice allowed him to see
a woman and four children coiled up
in a heap, trying to keep each other
warm. The man threw the loaf on
the floor, and a sort of gurgle rose to
welcome him. Bursting into tears,
he cried, in a voice half-defiant, half-choked
with grief:</p>

<p>"There, eat your fill; that's the
dearest loaf I ever bought. I have
robbed a gentleman of three guineas;
so let us husband them well, and let
me have no more teasings; for sooner
or later these doings must bring me
to the gallows, and all to satisfy your
clamors!"</p>

<p>Here the wife mingled her lamentations
with his, and the hungry children
set up a howl of sympathy, all
the while eying the loaf impatiently.
The poor woman, whimpering faintly,
broke off four large portions, and distributed
them among the starving little
ones, reserving smaller pieces for
herself and her wretched husband,
who was leaning despairingly on the
window-sill.</p>

<p>When hunger was a little appeased,
the group sat together as before, trying
to keep each other warm by the
contact of their frozen limbs, and
drawing over their feet the few rags
of clothing they possessed. At last
the man broke out into sobs:</p>

<p>"God forgive me! wife, this cannot
go on. This money weighs like lead
in my pocket."</p>

<p>"Dear," said the woman timidly,
"I heard a priest say once that a
starving man might take a loaf out
of a baker's shop to stay his hunger,
and do no sin."</p>

<p>"Ay," said the man gloomily,
"if the baker would let him take it.
But he would have put me in jail if
I'd done it. I'd as lief go to jail as
not, if it wasn't for you here; but I
thought that would not do, and I
know a gentleman is less likely to
make a fuss, and Jim's pistol did
the business; but hang me if I'll do
it again, if we do have to starve
for it."</p>

<p>The listener outside took up his
lantern. "So the man's a Catholic,"
he wondered. "I heard master say
the Catholics helped each other;
anyhow, I'll go home, and report
about what I've seen."</p>

<p>Cautiously he got down the dangerous
stairs, and looked well about
him, that he might know the landmarks
of the region again. He
reached the inn about an hour after
Mr. Stamyn, who was sitting in his
room, waiting anxiously for him. He
told his tale, not forgetting to make
much of his own dexterity in following
the poor "robber." His master
listened attentively, then gave orders
to the boy to call him at six the next
morning, when he would follow him
to the man's dwelling. The morning
was clear, frosty, and bright.
The dawn was just breaking, and, if
the town could look peaceful at any
time, it did then. On the way, or,
rather, in the immediate neighborhood
of the poor man's abode, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
Stamyn stopped to inquire what the
man was who lived in such a chamber
with a wife and four children.
He was told that he was a shoemaker,
a very good kind of a man, very
industrious, and a neat workman; but
being burdened with a family, and
the times being so bad, he had fallen
out of work, and had a hard struggle
to live.</p>

<p>The two then climbed the stairs,
Which were hardly safer in the morning's
uncertain light than they had
seemed in the dark the night before,
and stopped before the shoemaker's
door.</p>

<p>They knocked, and the crazy door
was opened by the unfortunate man
himself. He no sooner perceived
who his visitor was, than he dreaded
to learn the motive of the visit, which
must surely be the speedy punishment
of last night's robbery. He
threw himself at the feet of Mr.
Stamyn, saying in a broken voice:</p>

<p>"O sir! indeed it was the first
time, as it will be the last, that ever
I touch what does not belong to me;
but I was drove to it by my poor
children here. Two days had they
been without bread, sir, and they
cried that pitiful I couldn't stand it
no longer. I was ashamed to beg,
sir, and folk mostly say no to a story
as looks so like a ready-made one.
Surely, sir, you won't go to punish
me, ... and these poor things dependin'
on me? I swear I'll die
sooner than do such a thing again.
It was against the grain I did it, sir;
indeed it was."</p>

<p>Mr. Stamyn had taken up the
youngest child in his arms, and was
hushing its cries.</p>

<p>"No, my poor fellow, it was not
to reproach or punish you I came.
I have not the least intention of
doing you any harm. You have a
good character among your neighbors;
but you must expect to be
quickly cut short in such freedoms
as you took with me. Hold your
hand; here's thirty guineas for you to
buy leather. Live close, and set your
children a commendable example;
and to put you further out of temptation
with such unbecoming doings,
as you are a neat workman (they tell
me) and I am not particularly hurried,
make for me and this boy two
pairs of shoes each, which he shall
call upon you for."</p>

<p>The poor man, dumfounded and
almost in tears, stood before his
benefactor, gazing at him and at the
shining coins in his own open hand.
The wife cried softly to herself, and
the children, growing accustomed to
the stranger, began swarming about
his legs. Mr. Stamyn's servant then
laid down a good-sized basket, and
took off the lid. The children rushed
to this new attraction, and began
diving into the recesses of the basket
with their poor, skinny little
hands. The woman went up to Mr.
Stamyn:</p>

<p>"Oh! sir, we'll bless you to our
dying day. And never fear; my husband
is a good workman, and he will
work night and day with a will to
make you the finest pair of shoes
that ever was.... And, oh! sir, the
children shall pray for you, that God
may reward what you've done for a
poor, starving family. No; my husband,
he never stole before in his
life, sir."</p>

<p>Here the husband, recovering his
powers of speech, joined in, and
rained blessings on his kind patron,
who left the miserable place in a far
more cheerful frame of mind than he
had enjoyed at the great meeting
last night. Just before he left Weston,
the shoes were brought to him
by the wife and her eldest child, who
loaded him again with the most
grateful blessings, and promised to
pray that, if he were not a Catholic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
still God would "grant him grace to
save his soul."</p>

<p>Mr. Stamyn smiled sadly, and
bade his new friends good-by, having
learnt their name, and promised
in return never to forget it, should
he happen to be in Weston again.
Christmas had been a happy season
with him this year; and though, by
his present to the poor shoemaker,
he had curtailed his own pleasure-jaunt,
he felt that, after all, he had
chosen the better part....</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p>It was Christmas once more.
Forty years had come and gone, and
prosperity reigned in the North of
England. A famine worse than
that early one had swept over the
land&mdash;a famine of work and cotton&mdash;but
even the traces of that dire misfortune
had gone now, and mills and
factories were as busy as they could
be.</p>

<p>In the neighboring county of Cumberland,
in a retired little town, agricultural
and pacific, stood a pretty,
old-fashioned house, half-mansion,
half-cottage. One side, with its dignified
portal of granite, faced the
street; but its garden, with bow-windows
and porches jutting out among
the flowers, almost leaned on the
mountain. The family room looked
into the snow-covered garden; the
deep windows were embowered in ivy,
bearing a fringe of tiny icicles, while
inside wreaths of holly hung festooned
over the dark curtains. Over the
large and very high mantel-piece,
where a fox's brush and head mingled
with the branching antlers of the red
deer, there hung a framed device,
illuminated in mediæval letters:
"Peace on earth to men of good
will"; above the door was a large
bunch of mistletoe.</p>

<p>The window was partly open, the
huge fire warming the room quite
enough to allow of this; on the sill
was scattered a feast of bread-crumbs
steeped in milk, at which two or
three robins were pecking industriously.</p>

<p>This was the mayor's house. He
was an old man of seventy-five, universally
respected for his incorruptible
honesty and his steady, reliable character.
He had been born in the
town, but had left it while yet a baby
in arms, had then returned a grown
man and father of a family, gone into
trade, become a successful business
man, and seven years ago retired
honorably into private life. Of his
sons, one was a mill-owner near Manchester,
one had succeeded to his father's
local business and factory, and
one, his youngest, had died at sea,
leaving a little girl, his only child,
to the care of its grandparents. The
old man's only daughter was a nun
in a Carmelite convent in the South
of France.</p>

<p>No one but the mayor, his wife,
and grandchild lived in this cosey
house, and a very happy household
it was. The girl had been partly
brought up abroad, and had acquired
many graceful foreign traits as a set-off
to her English complexion and
somewhat hoidenish manners. She
was the apple of their eye to the
old couple, who let her rule them
and the house like a young empress.
The mayor was nothing but a great
baby in her hands, and people knew
that the surest way to his heart or
his purse was through that saucy
little beauty, Philippa Mason. Strangers
passing through the town used
to marvel how it was that a Catholic
had been elected mayor; but they
were assailed by such a torrent of
eulogies on "the best, most generous,
most public-spirited, most conscientious
of our citizens" that they
were glad to take all for granted,
and applaud the choice of the free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>men
of Carthwaite without further
explanation.</p>

<p>One other inmate of the mayor's
house will be found worthy of notice&mdash;old
Armstrong, or Uncle Jim, as he
was mostly called. Verging upon
sixty, he was still tall, slight, and
erect in stature; his manners had
some degree of refinement, and he
was wont at times to hint mysteriously
at his former connection with
the gentlefolk of the land. Everybody
liked him and laughed at him.
He was the most good-humored and
the most unlucky of mortals. He
spoke loftily of the fortune he lost in
his youth through cards and wine;
and every one knew that when Mr.
Mason, twenty years before, had
kindly set him up in a small business
of his own, he had not waited six
months before he owned himself a
bankrupt. Not a stain was on his
character, but everything he touched
seemed doomed. Money oozed
through his fingers like water, while
there was no visible cause for it;
and the poorer he became, the merrier
he was. At last, he had taken
refuge with Mr. Mason, and become
a part of his establishment. No one
knew or inquired about his origin;
people were glad enough to let the
character of his patron vouch for the
respectability of the harmless, amusing,
kind-hearted old oddity.</p>

<p>As these four sat in the study (for
so Philippa would have her favorite
room called), they discussed their
plans for the ensuing festival week.</p>

<p>"Uncle Jim has been invaluable,"
said the girl; "he has been my head-carpenter
for the stage in the school,
and has made such a grotto for the
crib, and, above all, he has carved
two wonderful alms-dishes for the
collection to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"Thank God! the church is to
be opened to-morrow, wife," said the
mayor, seeking his wife's hand. "I
may not live to see another Christmas
nor hear another midnight Mass.
In our young days, we little thought
we should see such things&mdash;when
priests would ride forty miles to
a dying bed, booted and spurred,
with pistols to fight the highwaymen.
Why, even in town, it was as much
as we could do to get to our duty at
Easter every year."</p>

<p>"Grandpapa," said Philippa, "by
next summer the spire will be finished,
and we can have the banner of
the cross floating there, as of old
the city standard used to fly over
the cathedrals."</p>

<p>"Child," answered Mr. Mason,
"by next summer your bridal train
may set the bells of the church a-ringing;
and if I live to see that, I'll ask
no more of Heaven."</p>

<p>"Nobody knows where to look for
the bridegroom yet," said Philippa
saucily.</p>

<p>"Hush!" put in the grandmother.
"On the day when God gave his
own Son to the world, and gave to
your grandfather and me such a great
blessing&mdash;years ago&mdash;no one must
speak lightly of the gifts he may yet
please to send or no." After a
pause, Uncle Jim said hesitatingly:</p>

<p>"The good Lord certainly feeds
the sparrows, as the Bible says, and
I suppose that's why Miss Mason,
<em>she</em> must feed the robins, just to follow
the path we're told to; but it
seems to me, if I'd waited for Him
to feed <em>me</em> one day that I well remember,
I'd have gone hungrier than
you ever did, master, in the days of
your trouble."</p>

<p>Philippa looked up with an expectant
smile; she always anticipated
fun when the old man adopted the
mock-serious tone.</p>

<p>"Yes," continued the narrator,
pleased to have at least the encouragement
of an indulgent silence extended
to him; "and I was prancing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
the best blue broadcloth and the
most shining buttons you ever saw,
and had on beautiful new boots that
I never paid for ..."</p>

<p>"You rascal!" softly said the
mayor.</p>

<p>"And a hat with such a curly
brim," continued Jim imperturbably.
"Well, it was in the summer, the
only time I really <em>was</em> hungry&mdash;I
don't mean the summer, but that <em>that</em>
occasion was the only one when I
was nigh starving&mdash;and I and two
friends, who had helped me to empty
my purse, were at Bath. None of
us had any money left; in fact, <em>they</em>
never had of their own, but were of
those whose tongue is their fortune;
but hungry we all were, and must
have something to eat. 'I have it!'
I cried, for I was not a bad hand
at imagination, 'Follow me to the
White Hart;' and on the way I explained
my plan. You will hear
later what it was. Now, you will
say, Mr. Mayor, that I had better
have laid myself down by a haystack,
and slept there on an empty stomach;
and indeed, after a good supper,
such as we had to-night, it would be
easy enough for <em>me</em> to say so; but
just then it wasn't likely to be my
opinion. So we walked into the
hotel, as bold as kings, and ordered
a private room and dinner for three&mdash;French
soups and oyster patties, fish
and game, and foreign sauces and
ale, just as <em>I</em> knew it should be, and
Madeira and champagne, of course.
When we had done (and, in the intervals
when the waiter had gone for
the next course, we pocketed as much
as our pockets would stand of anything
that was solid), we called for
the bill, and the waiter brought it,
as pompous as you will, on a silver
salver. I put my hand in my pocket,
whereupon one of my friends, <em>he</em>
says: 'Come, come, I'll stand this;
it was I who proposed it and chose
the wines.' And he puts his hand
in his pocket. 'Bless me!' cries
the other. 'Gentlemen, I protest; it
was I who ordered the dinner, and I
request, as a favor, you let me pay;
the cost is but a trifle." And <em>he</em> put
his hand in his pocket. The waiter
stood grinning and smirking, and
thinking this great fun. "'An idea
strikes me,' I then said. 'Waiter, we'll
blindfold you and shut the door,
and whoever you catch first will
settle the bill.' At this my friends
clapped their hands, and the waiter,
as proud as a peacock at the condescension
of such fine young gentlemen,
gives us a napkin to tie over
his eyes, and lets us spin him round
two or three times, that he may begin
fair. 'Now!' I cried, and he
began feeling about, afraid to upset
the table; but he knew the room well,
and went first to a closet beside the
further door. While he made a
noise opening it and feeling inside,
I slid to another door, and gently
pushed it ajar. In a twinkling we
were all three walking leisurely out
of the White Hart, looking like independent
gentlemen, who did the
host the great honor of approving
of his cook! That afternoon, we
drew lots which should sell his fine
suit to pay travelling expenses, and
it fell on me; so good-by to my gay
plumage, says I, and never dropt a
tear, but got the money and played
valet to the other two till we got to
London, where I made them pay me
what they owed through a lucky
stroke at cards. And then we parted
company, nothing loath on my side.
So that is how I read the saying, 'The
Lord helps them as helps themselves.'"</p>

<p>Every one smiled at the privileged
old man, though Philippa held up a
warning forefinger and whispered:
"Grandpapa told me once that you
were not half so bad as you make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
yourself out to be. Why did you not
put on ladies' clothes, and go and beg
for a dinner? They could not have
said no to a pretty face, and it would
have been better than stealing."</p>

<p>"Hark at that!" said Uncle Jim
aloud. "You women are born to fool
us. If I had my life to begin again,
I should take advantage of that suggestion.
The truth was, high society
ruined me; and here I am, a
destitute waif without a home. It is
the first chapter of the Prodigal Son;
but I shall never get into the second."</p>

<p>He looked with comical gravity at
Mr. Mason, whose glance of affectionate
amusement perfectly satisfied him
in return; and then the old man,
drawing Philippa towards him, said
gently to her:</p>

<p>"On your next birthday, as you
know, child, you will become entitled
to all my fortune, and with this present
will enter, too, into great responsibilities.
Now, to give you an idea
of what wealth is, what it can do, and
how grave a trust it is, I will tell you
a story too, but more humbly than
good Uncle Jim, because my fault
was more reckless, and because God
has been more merciful to me in
making it bring forth real good.
Your father and your uncles were all
little things then, and do not remember
it, except very dimly; and
since that Christmas, forty years ago,
I have never repeated the tale."</p>

<p>And in simple, forcible language
the Mayor of Carthwaite told his
grandchild the story of the distress in
Weston in the year 18&mdash;, the famine
and the wretchedness, the temptations
of starving men, and finally
the incident in which Mr. Stamyn
and the poor shoemaker had figured
side by side forty years ago. "And
your grandmother and I have prayed
for that good man every night without
ever missing," added the old
man, "and taught your father to do
so; you yourself, child, have prayed
for the kind friend, whose conversion
to the true faith was our greatest
wish. But his name and what
his kindness was I never told a soul
till now."</p>

<p>Philippa was silent. Uncle Jim hid
his face, and sobbed. The old couple
clasped hands by the fireside,
and looked into each other's faces,
as they remembered the bare attic
where they had shivered and starved,
and been nearly driven to become
criminals by the sheer force of hunger.
Nearly two generations had
passed, and they were still together,
thanking God that he had put it into
the heart of man to relieve his fellow-man
that night, when a life of
crime and disgrace had so nearly begun
to drag them down to the level
of a "jail-bird." Philippa crept up
to them softly, and kissed them both.</p>

<p>"I understand your life and your
charities so much better now," she
said; "and when I have the same responsibility
thrust upon me, believe
me, I will do as you have done."</p>

<p>The bells began to chime, and the
party bestirred themselves to go over
to the chapel, where the midnight
Mass was to be said for the last time.
To-morrow the church was to be
opened, and dedicated to "Our Lady
and S. Crispin," and the chapel
was to become a school. Uncle Jim
was Philippa's special escort, for the
old couple would never separate.</p>

<p>"Did you know that story?" she
whispered to him as they crossed the
silent streets.</p>

<p>"Ay, but he told me never to
speak of it till he gave me leave.
He did not tell you who the lad was
that spied upon him that night; it
was poor Uncle Jim."</p>

<p>Philippa looked aghast.</p>

<p>"Yes," he went on, "and I left
Mr. Stamyn some years after, and
tried to live as a gentleman on my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
earnings; but, as I told you in jest,
a heap of rascals helped me to empty
my purse, and it was soon drained
of all. I remembered your grandfather,
had taken a fancy to him in
Weston, went back, and found him.
He took me in, and was very good
to me, useless as I was. I was always
a shiftless fellow, and never
could keep what money I got. So
he thought it better just to keep me
at home, and I tried to be useful, and
could be, too, when there was no
question of money; and so it has
been for nigh a score of years. Here
we are at the chapel. That's one
thing I never saw&mdash;your religion;
but then, Mr. Mason is the best man
I ever saw, and he's a Catholic.
Anyways, there's no other religion I
like better."</p>

<p>And Uncle Jim went in and decorously
assisted at the service, just as
if it was quite familiar to him and he
liked it. I suspect he did, as far as
he understood it. What the Masons
believed could not be very far
wrong.</p>

<p>The next morning there was a
grand ceremony at the new church,
and an unlimited amount of beef and
pudding distributed by tickets among
the poorer inhabitants of Carthwaite.
After service, a carriage drove up to
Mr. Mason's door.</p>

<p>A very old gentleman, followed
by a much younger one, stepped out,
and inquired for the mayor. They
were shown into the study, where all
the Masons&mdash;cousins, uncles, etc.&mdash;had
now assembled. The servant
announced "Mr. Stamyn."</p>

<p>Uncle Jim, recovering the instincts
of his youth, suddenly stood up respectfully
before his former master,
who, however, did not seem to have
the slightest recollection of him.</p>

<p>Mr. Stamyn went up to Mrs. Mason.
"My dear friends," he said,
"you both told me not to forget
your name; it was five years ago
that I returned to Weston, and I did
not fail to make inquiries, but hardly
hoping that I should find you.
They told me you had left, and I
was lucky enough to find a clue to
your subsequent career. I need not
say how happy I am to redeem my
promise to visit you again; I should
certainly have been so, had I found
you still in smoky old Weston, but
here doubly."</p>

<p>Every one, especially Philippa, was
struck by the old-time courtesy, precise,
formal, yet most cordial, with
which Mr. Stamyn spoke; his young
companion glanced admiringly at
the girl, instinctively distinguishing
her from the more buxom damsels
assembled round the family hearth&mdash;her
cousins of Manchester and Carthwaite.
Mr. Mason asked his friend
and patron to stay with them, and
sit at his board as the chief Christmas
guest; he gladly complied, and
said laughingly that he had expected
to be asked. It was not
until after the family meal that Uncle
Jim revealed himself to his former
master. His awkward self-consciousness
and hurried glances had amused
Mr. Stamyn in secret all the time,
though his own perfectly controlled
manner had given no sign of surprise
or amusement; but when Jim, mysteriously
bending over Mr. Stamyn's
chair, feelingly asked what had become
of the boy James, the old gentleman's
eyes began to twinkle with
premonitory signal-fire.</p>

<p>"He left me a few years after our
Weston adventure, and, I very much
fear, went to the devil!" was the answer.</p>

<p>"No, sir; Mr. Stamyn," said Jim,
shaking with excitement, "he went
to Mason."</p>

<p>"James," said his master seriously,
"you could not possibly have done
better; I congratulate you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE SONG OF ROLAND.</h3>


<p class="center">CONCLUDED.
</p>

<p>The night flies away, and the
white dawn appears. Charles, the
majestic emperor, mounts his charger,
and casts his eye over the army.
"My lords barons," he says, "behold
these dark defiles, these narrow gorges.
To whom do you counsel me
to give the command of the rear-guard?"</p>

<p>"To whom?" replies Ganelon.
"To whom but to my son-in-law
Roland? Is he not a baron of great
valor?"</p>

<p>At these words the emperor looks
at him, saying, "You are a very devil!
What deadly rage has entered
into you?"</p>

<p>Roland approaches; he has heard
the words of Ganelon. "Sire father-in-law,"
he says, "what thanks do I
not owe you for having asked for
me the command of the rear-guard!
Our emperor, be assured, shall lose
nothing; neither steed nor palfrey,
cart-horse nor sumpter-mule, shall be
taken, or our swords shall make more
than the price."</p>

<p>"I believe it well," rejoins Ganelon.</p>

<p>"Ah! son of an accursed race!"
cries Roland, who can no longer
contain his anger, "thou thoughtest
that the glove would fall from my
hands as it did from thine." Then,
turning to the emperor, he prays
him to give into his hand the bow
which he grasps with his own.</p>

<p>The emperor's countenance darkens;
he hesitates to place his nephew
in the rear-guard. But the
Duke de Naymes says to him, "Give
the bow to Count Roland; the rear-guard
belongs to him of right, since
none other could conduct it so well
as he."</p>

<p>And the emperor gives Roland
the bow, saying, "My fair nephew,
know you what I desire? I would
leave with you the half of my army.
Take it, I pray you; it shall be for
your safety."</p>

<p>"Nay," cries Roland, "I will have
no such thing. God forbid that I
should belie my race! Leave me
twenty thousand valiant Frenchmen,
and set out with all the rest. Pass
at ease through the defiles, and,
while I am alive, fear no man in the
world."</p>

<p>Roland mounts his charger. He
is joined by his faithful Oliver, then
Gérer, then Berenger, and the aged
Anséis, Gérard of Roussillon, and
the Duke Gaifier. "I, too, will be
there," says the Archbishop Turpin,
"for I ought in duty to follow my
chief."</p>

<p>"And I also," says Count Gauthier.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
"Roland is my liege-lord, and I must
not fail him."</p>

<p>The vanguard begins its march.</p>

<p>How lofty are these peaks! What
sombre valleys! How black the
rocks; the defiles how profound!
The French, in these dark gorges,
seem oppressed with sadness. The
sound of their footsteps may be
heard full fifteen leagues away.</p>

<p>When they draw near to their mother-country,
within sight of the land
of Gascony, they call to mind their
fiefs and their possessions, their tender
children and their noble wives.
The tears start into their eyes&mdash;those
of Charles most of all; for his
heart is heavy at the thought that
he has left Roland among the
mountains of Spain.</p>

<p>He hides his face with his mantle.
"What ails you, sire?" asks the Duke
Naymes, riding by his side.</p>

<p>"Is there any need to ask?" he
answers. "In the grief that I am in,
how can I refrain from groaning?
France will be undone by Ganelon.
In a dream this night an angel has
made this known to me. He broke
my lance in my hands&mdash;he who
caused me to give the rear-guard to
Roland, leaving him in this ungentle
land. Heavens! were I to lose Roland,
I should never see his like
again!"</p>

<p>Charles wept; and a hundred
thousand Frenchmen, touched by
his tears, shuddered as they thought
upon Roland. Ganelon, the felon,
has sold him for gold and silver, and
shining stuffs; for horses, and camels,
and lions.</p>

<p>King Marsilion has sent for all the
barons of Spain: dukes, counts, and
viscounts, emirs and sons of the senators.
He assembles four thousand
of them in three days.</p>

<p>The drums beat in Saragossa; the
image of Mahomet is set on its
highest tower; and there is no pagan
who does not feel himself inflamed
at the sight. Then, behold, all the
Saracens set forth, riding at double
speed into the depths of these long
valleys. By dint of haste, they have
come in sight of the gonfalons of
France and of the rear-guard of the
twelve brave peers. By evening they
lie in ambush in a wood of fir-trees
on the sides of the rocks. Four hundred
thousand men are hidden there,
awaiting the return of the sun. O
heavens! what woe! for the French
knew naught of this.</p>

<p>The day appears. Now it is the
question in the Saracen army who
shall strike the first blow. The nephew
of Marsilion caracoles before
his uncle. "Fair my lord the king,"
he says, with a joyful countenance,
"in severe and numerous combats I
have served you so greatly that I
ask as a reward the honor of conquering
Roland."</p>

<p>Twenty others follow in turn to
boast before Marsilion. One says:
"At Roncevaux I am going to play
the man. If I find Roland, all is over
with him. What shame and sorrow
for the French! Their emperor is so
old that he is imbecile. He will not
pass another day without weeping."
"Never fear," says another. "Mahomet
is stronger than S. Peter! I
will meet Roland at Roncevaux; he
cannot escape death. Look at my
sword; I will measure it against his
Durandal, and you will then soon
hear which is the longest." "Come,
sire," says a third, "come and see
all these Frenchmen slain. We will
take Charlemagne, and make a present
of him to you, and will give you
the lands of the rest. Before a year
is over, we shall have fixed ourselves
in the town of St. Denis."</p>

<p>While they thus excite each other
to the combat, they contrive, behind
the fir-wood, to put on their Saracen
coats of mail, lace on their Saragossa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
helmets, gird on their swords of
Viennese steel, seize their shields and
their Valencian lances, surmounted
by white, blue, and scarlet gonfalons.
They mount neither mules nor palfreys,
but strong steeds, and ride in
close ranks. The sun shines; the
gold of their vestments sparkles and
gleams; a thousand clarions begin to
sound.</p>

<p>The French listen. "Sire companion,"
says Oliver, "we may soon
have battle with the Saracens."</p>

<p>"God grant it!" replies Roland.
"Let us think of our king. We ought
to know how to suffer for our lord,
bear heat and cold, let our skin be
slashed, and risk our heads. Let
every one be ready to strike hard
blows. We must take heed to what
sort of songs may be sung of us.
You have the right, Christians, and
the pagans the wrong. Never shall
bad example be given you by me."</p>

<p>Oliver climbs a tall pine-tree,
looks to the right in the wooded valley,
and beholds the Saracen horde
approaching. "Comrade," he cries
to Roland, "what a din and tumult
is there on the Spanish side!
Heavens! how many white halberds
and gleaming helmets! What a
rough meeting for our French! Ganelon
knew it&mdash;the felon! the traitor!"</p>

<p>"Peace, Oliver," answers Roland.
"He is my father-in-law; speak not
of him."</p>

<p>Oliver dismounts. "Lords barons,"
he says, "I have seen even now
so great a multitude of these pagans
that no man here below has ever beheld
the like. We shall have a battle
such as there has never been before.
Ask God for courage!" And
the French reply: "Woe to him that
flees! To die for you, not one of us
all will be found wanting."</p>

<p>"Roland, my comrade," says the
prudent Oliver, "these pagans are
a multitude, and we are very few.
Heed me, and sound your horn; the
emperor will hear, and will lead back
the army."</p>

<p>"Do you take me for a madman?"
answers Roland. "Would
you have me lose my honor in sweet
France? Let Durandal do its work&mdash;strike
its heavy blows, and steep itself
in blood to the haft; all these
pagans are as good as dead, I warrant
you!"</p>

<p>"Roland, my comrade, sound
your <em>olifant</em>, that the emperor may
hear and come to your aid."</p>

<p>"Heaven keep me from such cowardice!
Count upon Durandal; you
will see how it will slay the pagans."</p>

<p>"Roland, my comrade, sound your
<em>olifant</em>, that the emperor may hear it
and return."</p>

<p>"Please God, then, no!" replies
Roland once more. "No man here
below shall ever say I sounded my
horn because of the pagans. Never
shall like reproach be brought against
my race!"</p>

<p>"What reproach? What would
you have people say? These Saracens
cover the valleys, the mountain,
the high-lands, and the plains.
I have just beheld it, this innumerable
host; and we are but a feeble
company."</p>

<p>"My courage grows at the
thought," says Roland. "Neither
God nor his angels will suffer it that
by me our France shall lose her renown.
Sire comrade, and my friend,
speak no more to me thus. We will
stand our ground. For us will be
the blows; our emperor wills it.
Among the soldiers he has confided
to us there is not a single coward;
he knows it. Our emperor loves us
because we strike well. Strike, then,
thou with thy lance, and I with my
good sword Durandal&mdash;Charles' gift
to me. If I die, he who gets it shall
be able to say, this was a brave man's
sword!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span></p>

<p>At this moment, the Archbishop
Turpin put spurs to his horse, gained
an eminence, and, calling the French
around him, said to them, "Lords
barons, our emperor has left us here,
and for him we ought to die well.
Remember that you are Christians.
The battle draws on; you see it.
The Saracens are there. Call to
mind your sins; cry God's mercy.
I will absolve you for the health of
your souls. If you die, you will all
be martyrs, and will find good place
in the heights of Paradise!" The
French dismount from their horses,
and kneel on the ground, while the
archbishop blesses them on the part
of God, and for their penance bids
them strike hard blows. Absolved
and rid of their sins, they rise and remount
their horses.</p>

<p>Roland, in his shining armor, is
beautiful to behold, mounted on his
good charger, Vaillantif. The golden
reins ring in his hand, and on the
top of his lance, which he holds with
its point to heaven, floats a white
gonfalon. The brave knight advances
with a clear and serene countenance,
followed by his companion,
and then by all these noble French,
whose courage he makes strong.
He casts his lofty glance upon the
Saracens, and, gently turning his head
to those about him, says, "March,
my lords barons, without haste.
These pagans are hastening to their
destruction." While he speaks, the
two armies approach, and are about
to accost each other.</p>

<p>"No more words," cries Oliver.
"You have not deigned to sound
your <em>olifant</em>. There is nothing to expect
from the emperor; nothing for
which to reproach him. The brave
one, he knows not a word of that
which is befalling us; the fault is
none of his. Now, my lords barons,
hold firm, and for the love of
God, I pray you, let us not fear
blows; let us know how to give and
take. Above all, let us not forget
the cry of Charlemagne." Whereupon
the French all shouted, <i lang="fr">Montjoie!</i>
Whoso had heard them would
never all his life lose the remembrance
of that shout.</p>

<p>Then they advance&mdash;heavens!
with what boldness. To be brief, the
horsemen have charged. What better
could they do?</p>

<p>The pagans do not draw back;
the <i lang="fr">mêlée</i> begins. They provoke
each other by word and gesture.
The nephew of Marsilion, with insult
in his mouth, flies upon Roland.
Roland with one stroke of his lance
lays him dead at his feet. The king's
brother, Falsaron, desires to revenge
his nephew's death; but Oliver forestalls
him by planting his lance in
his body. A certain Corsablix, one
of these barbarian kings, vomits forth
slanders and bravadoes. Abp. Turpin
hearing him, bears down upon
him in full force, and with his lance
stretches him dead upon the ground.
Each time that a Saracen falls the
French cry, <i lang="fr">Montjoie!</i>&mdash;the shout of
Charlemagne.</p>

<p>Defiances and combats succeed
each other fast on every side; everywhere
the French are the conquerors;
there is not a pagan who is not overthrown.
Roland advances, thrusting
with his lance as long as there
remains a fragment of its wood in his
hand. But at the fifteenth stroke the
lance breaks; then he draws his
good sword Durandal, which carves
and slices the Saracens right valiantly,
so that the dead lie heaped around
him. Blood flows in torrents around
the spot, and over his horse and his
arms. He perceives in the <i lang="fr">mêlée</i>
his faithful Oliver breaking with the
but-end of his lance the skull of the
pagan Fauseron. "Comrade," cries
Roland, "what do you? Of what
use is a stick in such a fight? Iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
and steel are what you need. Where
is your Hauteclaire&mdash;your sword
hafted with crystal and gold?"</p>

<p>"I cannot draw it," said the other.
"I have to strike the blows so thick
and fast, they give me too much to
do."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, with knightly skill
he snatches it from its scabbard, and
holds it up to Roland, the next moment
striking with it a pagan, who
falls dead, and cutting also through
his gold-enamelled saddle and his
horse to the chine. "I hold you for
my brother," cries Roland. "Such
are the blows which our emperor
loves so much." And on all sides
they cry, <i lang="fr">Montjoie!</i></p>

<p>How the fight rages! What blows
fall on every side! How many broken
lances covered with blood!
How many gonfalons torn to shreds!
And, ah! how many brave Frenchmen
there lose their youth! Never
more will they see again their mothers,
their wives, or their friends in
France, who wait for them beyond
the mountains!</p>

<p>During this time, Charles groans
and laments: to what purpose?
Can he succor them by weeping?
Woe worth the day that Ganelon did
him the sorry service of journeying
to Saragossa! The traitor will pay
the penalty; the scaffold awaits him.
But death, meanwhile, spares not our
French. The Saracens fall by thousands,
and so, also, do our own; they
fall, and of the best!</p>

<p>In France, at this very hour, arise
tremendous storms. The winds are
unchained, the thunder roars, the
lightning glares; hail and rain fall in
torrents, and the earth trembles.
From S. Michael of Paris to Sens,
from Besançon to the port of Wissant,
not a place of shelter whose
walls do not crack. At mid-day
there is a black darkness, lit up only
by the fire of the lightnings; there is
not a man who does not tremble; and
some say that, with the end of the
century, the end of the world is
coming. They are mistaken; it is
the great mourning for the death of
Roland.</p>

<p>Marsilion, who until then had kept
himself apart, has beheld from afar
the slaughter of his men; he commands
the horns and clarions to
sound, and puts in motion the main
body of his army.</p>

<p>When the French behold on every
side fresh floods of the enemy let
loose upon them, they look to see
where is Roland, where is Oliver,
where are the twelve peers? Every
one would seek shelter behind them.
The archbishop encourages them all.
"For God's sake, barons, fly not!
Better a thousand times die fighting!
All is over with us. When this day
closes, not one of us will be left in
this world; but paradise, I promise
you, is yours." At these words their
ardor rekindles, and again they raise
the cry, <i lang="fr">Montjoie!</i></p>

<p>But, see there Climorin, the Saracen
who at Marsilion's palace embraced
Ganelon and gave him his
sword. He is mounted on a horse
more swift than the swallow, and has
even now driven his lance into the
body of Angélier de Bordeaux. This
is the first Frenchman of mark that
has fallen in the <i lang="fr">mêlée</i>, and quickly
has Oliver avenged him; with one
blow of his Hauteclaire the Saracen
is struck down, and the demons bear
away his ugly soul. Then this other
pagan, Valdabron, strikes to the
heart the noble Duke Sanche, who
falls dead from the saddle. What
grief for Roland! He rushes on
Valdabron, dealing him a blow which
cleaves his skull, in sight of the terrified
pagans. In his turn, Abp.
Turpin rolls in the dust the African
Mancuidant, who has just slain
Anséis. Roland overthrows and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
kills the son of the King of Cappadocia;
but what mischief has not
this pagan done us before he died?
Gérin and Gérer, his comrade, Berenger,
Austore, and Guy de Saint Antoine,
all died by his hand.</p>

<p>How thin our ranks are growing!
The battle is stormy and terrible.
Never saw you such heaps of dead,
so many wounds, and so much blood
flowing in streams on the green grass.
Our men strike desperate blows.
Four times they sustain the shock,
but at the fifth they fall, saving sixty
only, whom may God spare! for
dearly they will sell their lives.</p>

<p>When Roland sees this disaster,
"Dear comrade," he says to Oliver,
"how many brave hearts lying on
the ground! What grievous loss for
our sweet France! Charles, our emperor,
why are you not here? Oliver,
my brother, what shall be done, and
how shall we give him of our tidings?"</p>

<p>"There is no means," answers Oliver;
"it is better to die than shamefully
to flee."</p>

<p>"I will sound my <em>olifant</em>," says
Roland. "Charles will hear it in
the depths of the defiles, and, be
assured, he will return."</p>

<p>"Ah! but what shame! And of
your race, my friend, do you then
think no more? When I spoke of
this anon, nothing would you do, nor
will you now, at least not by my
counsel. Your arms are bleeding;
you have not now the strength to
sound it well."</p>

<p>"Sooth, but what hard blows I
have been giving! Nevertheless, we
have to do with too strong a force.
I will blow my <em>olifant</em>, and Charles
will hear."</p>

<p>"Nay, then, by no means shall
you do this thing, and by my beard
I swear it. Should I ever see again
my noble sister, my dear Aude, never
shall you be in her arms!"</p>

<p>"Wherefore this anger?" Roland
asks.</p>

<p>"Comrade," the other answers,
"you have lost us! Rashness is not
courage. These French are dead
through your imprudence. Had
you believed me, the emperor would
have been here, the battle would be
gained, and we should have taken
Marsilion, alive or dead. Roland,
your prowess has cost us this mishap.
Charles, our great Charles, we
never shall serve more."</p>

<p>The Archbishop Turpin hears the
two friends, and runs to them, exclaiming,
"For God's sake, let alone
your quarrels! True, there is no
longer time for you to sound your
horn; but it is good, notwithstanding,
that the emperor should return.
Charles will avenge us, and these
pagans shall not return into their
Spain. Our French will find us here,
dead and cut to pieces, but they will
put us into coffins, and with tears
and mourning carry us to be laid in
the burial-grounds of our monasteries;
at least, we shall not be devoured
by dogs, or wolves, or wild boars."</p>

<p>"It is well spoken," answers Roland;
and forthwith he puts the <em>olifant</em>
to his lips, and blows with all the
strength of his lungs. The sound
penetrates and prolongs itself in the
depths of these far-reaching valleys.
Thirty long leagues away the echo is
repeating itself still!</p>

<p>Charles hears it; the army hears
it also. "They are giving battle to
our people," cries the emperor.
"Never does Roland sound his <em>olifant</em>
but in the heart of a battle."</p>

<p>"A battle, indeed!" says Ganelon.
"In another mouth one would have
called it a lie! Know you not Roland?
For a single hare he goes
horning a whole day. Come, let us
march on. Why should we delay?
The lands of our France are still far
away."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span></p>

<p>But Roland continues to blow his
<em>olifant</em>. He makes such great efforts
that the blood leaps from his mouth
and from the veins of his forehead.</p>

<p>"This horn has a long breath," says
the emperor; and the Duke de
Naymes replies, "It is a brave man
who blows it; there is battle around
him. By my faith, he who has betrayed
him so well seeks to deceive
you likewise. Believe me; march
to the succor of your noble nephew.
Do you not hear him? Roland is
at bay."</p>

<p>The emperor gives the signal.
Before setting out, he causes Ganelon
to be seized, abandoning the traitor
to his scullions. Hair by hair they
pull out his moustache and beard,
striking him with stick and fist, and
passing a chain round his neck, as
they would round that of a bear, and
then, for the extreme of ignominy,
setting him on a beast of burden.</p>

<p>On a signal from the emperor, all
the French have turned their horses'
heads, and throw themselves eagerly
back into the dark defiles and by the
rapid streams. Charles rides on in
haste. There is not one who, as he
runs, does not sigh and say to his
neighbor, "If we could only find
Roland, and at least see him before
he dies! How many blows have
we not struck together!"</p>

<p>Alas! to what purpose are these
vain efforts! They are too far off,
and cannot reach him in time.</p>

<p>Yet Roland glances anxiously
around him. On the heights, in the
plain, he sees nothing but Frenchmen
slain. The noble knight weeps
and prays for them. "Lords barons,
may God have you in his grace,
and may he open to your souls the
gate of his paradise, making them lie
down upon its holy flowers! Better
warriors than you I have never seen;
you have served us so long, you
have conquered for us so many
lands! O land of France! my so
sweet country, behold, thou art widowed
of many brave hearts! Barons
of France, you died by my fault. I
have not been able to save you
or guard you; may God be your
helper&mdash;God, who is always true!
If the sword slay me not, yet shall I
die of grief. Oliver, my brother, let
us return to the fight."</p>

<p>Roland appears again in the <i lang="fr">mêlée</i>.
As the stag before the hounds,
so do the pagans flee before Roland.
Behold, however, Marsilion, coming
forth as a warrior, and overthrowing
on his way Gérard de Roussillon and
other brave Frenchmen. "Perdition
be your portion," cries Roland,
"for thus striking down my comrades!"
And with one back-stroke of
Durandal he cuts off his hand, seizing
at the same time the fair hair of
Jurfalen, the king's son. At this
sight the Saracens cry out, "Save us,
Mahomet! Avenge us of these accursed
ones: they will never give
way. Let us flee! let us flee!" So
saying, a hundred thousand of them
took flight, nor is there fear that they
will ever return.</p>

<p>But what avails it that Marsilion
has fled? His uncle, Marganice, remains
in the field with his black-visaged
Ethiopians. He steals behind
Oliver, and strikes him a mortal
blow in the middle of the back.
"There is one," he cries, "whose
destruction avenges us for all we have
lost!" Oliver, stricken to death,
raises his arm, lets fall Hauteclaire
on the head of Marganice, makes
the diamonds sparkling on it fly
around in shivers, and splits his head
down to the teeth. "Accursed pagan,"
he says, "neither to thy wife
nor to any lady of thy land shalt
thou boast that thou hast slain me!"
Then he calls Roland to his aid.</p>

<p>Roland sees Oliver livid and colorless,
with the blood streaming down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
At this sight he feels himself fainting,
and swoons upon his horse.
Oliver perceives it not; he has lost
so much blood that his eyes fail; he
sees neither things far-off nor near.
His arm, which goes on wishing to
strike, raises Hauteclaire, and it is on
the helmet of Roland that the blow
falls, cutting it through down to the
nasal, but without touching his head.
At this blow, Roland looks at him,
and asks gently, "My comrade, did
you purpose to do this? It is I,
Roland, your dearest friend. I know
not that you have defied me."</p>

<p>And Oliver answers, "I hear you;
it is your voice, but I see you not at
all. If I have struck you, pardon
me, my friend!"</p>

<p>"You have done me no hurt, my
brother," answers Roland, "and I
forgive you here and before God."
At these words they bend towards
one another, and are separated during
this tender adieu!</p>

<p>Roland cannot tear himself away
from the body of his friend, stretched
lifeless on the earth; he contemplates
him, weeps over him, and
aloud reminds him of so many days
passed together in perfect friendship.
Oliver being dead, what a burden to
him is life!</p>

<p>During this time, without his having
perceived it, all our French had
perished, excepting only the archbishop
and Gauthier. Wounded, but
still standing, they call to Roland.
He hears and joins them. The pagans
cry out, "These are terrible
men; let us take heed not to leave
one of them alive." And from all
sides they throw themselves upon
them. Gauthier falls; Turpin has his
helmet cloven, his hauberk torn, four
wounds in his body, and his horse
killed under him. Roland, thinking
of the emperor, again seizes his <em>olifant</em>,
but he can only draw from it a
feeble and plaintive note.</p>

<p>Charles hears it notwithstanding.
"Woe betide us!" he cries. "Roland,
my dear nephew, we come too late!
I know it by the sound of his horn.
March! Sound clarions!" And all
the clarions of the host sounded together.
The noise reached the ears
of the pagans. "Alas!" they say to
each other, "it is Charles returning!
It is the great emperor. O fatal day
for us! All our chiefs are in the
dust. If Roland lives, the war will
begin again, and our Spain is lost to
us. Never will he be vanquished
by any man of flesh and blood. Let
us not go near, but from afar off cast
at him our darts." Thereupon they
withdraw, and rain upon him, from
a distance, darts and arrows, lances
and spears. Roland's shield is pierced,
his hauberk broken and unfastened;
his body is untouched, but
Vaillantif, wounded in twenty places,
falls dead beneath his master. This
blow given, all the pagans flee at
full speed further into Spain.</p>

<p>Roland, without horse, is unable
to follow the fugitives. He goes to
the succor of the archbishop, unlaces
his helmet, binds up his gaping
wounds, presses him to his heart, and
gently lays him on the grass. Then
he says to him softly, "Shall we
leave without prayers our companions
who lie dead around us, and
whom we loved so well? I will
fetch their bodies, and bring them
before you."</p>

<p>"Go," answers the archbishop, "we
are masters of the field; go, and return
again."</p>

<p>Roland leaves him, and advances
alone into the field of carnage,
seeking on the mountain, seeking
in the valley. He finds them&mdash;his
brave comrades and the Duke Sanche,
the aged Anséis, and Gérard,
and Berenger. One by one he
brings them, laying them at the knees
of the priest, who weeps while he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
blesses them. But when it comes to
the turn of Oliver; when Roland
would carry the body of this dear
comrade, closely pressed against his
heart, his face grows pale, his
strength forsakes him, and he falls
fainting on the ground.</p>

<p>The archbishop at this sight feels
himself seized with a deathlike grief.
There is, in this valley of Roncevaux,
a running stream; if only he could
give some water to Roland! He
seizes the <em>olifant</em>, and tries, with slow
steps, to drag himself tremblingly
along. But he is too feeble to advance.
His strength fails, and he
falls, with his face to the earth, in the
pangs of death.</p>

<p>Roland revives, and sees the
prostrate warrior. With his eyes
raised to heaven, and with joined
hands, he makes his confession to
God, and prays him to open to the
good soldier of Charlemagne the
gate of his paradise. Then he approaches
the bleeding body of the
holy prelate, raises his beautiful white
hands, and lays them crosswise on
his breast, bidding him a tender
adieu.</p>

<p>But Roland in his turn now feels
that the hand of death is upon him.
He prays to God for his peers, supplicating
him to call them to himself,
and invokes the holy angel Gabriel.
Taking in one hand the <em>olifant</em>, and
Durandal in the other, he climbs an
eminence looking towards Spain, and
there, in the green corn, underneath
a tree, he lets himself sink upon the
ground.</p>

<p>Near at hand, behind a marble
rock, a Saracen, lying in the midst of
the corpses, his face stained with
blood, the better to counterfeit death,
was watching him. He sees him
fall, and, suddenly springing up, he
runs to him, trying out, "Conquered!
the nephew of Charles! His
sword is mine; I will carry it to
Arabia!" He tries to draw it, but
Roland has felt something, opens his
eyes, and says, "You are not one of
our people, it seems to me;" and
with a blow of his <em>olifant</em> lays him
dead at his feet. "Miscreant," he says,
"thou art very bold&mdash;some would
say very mad&mdash;thus to lay hands on
me. However, I have split my <em>olifant</em>;
the gold and precious stones
are shaken from it by the blow."</p>

<p>Little by little Roland finds that
his sight is failing him. He raises
himself on his feet, trying to support
himself as best he may; but his countenance
is colorless and livid. On a
rock hard by he strikes ten blows
with Durandal. He would fain break
it, his valiant sword. What grief and
mourning would it not be to leave it
to the pagans! May this shame be
spared to France! But the steel cuts
into the rock, and does not break.
Roland strikes anew upon a rock of
sardonyx. Not the least flaw in the
steel! He strikes again. The rock
flies in pieces, but the steel resists.
"Ah!" he cries, "Holy Mary help
me! My Durandal, thou who didst
so brightly gleam in this resplendent
sun; thou, so beautiful and sacred,
who wast given to me by Charles at
the command of God himself; thou
by whom I have conquered Brittany
and Normandy, Maine and Poitou,
Aquitaine and Romagna, Flanders,
Bavaria, Germany, Poland, Constantinople,
Saxony, Iceland, and England,
long hast thou been in the
hands of a valiant man; shalt thou
fall now into a coward's power?
Ah! sacred Durandal, in thy golden
guard how many precious relics are
enshrined!&mdash;a tooth of S. Peter, the
blood of S. Basil, some hair of S.
Denis, a portion of Our Lady's robe&mdash;and
shall ever any pagan possess
thee? A brave man and a Christian
has alone the right to use thee."</p>

<p>Even as he utters these words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
death is stealing over him, until it
reaches his heart. He stretches himself
at length upon the green grass,
laying under him his sword and his
dear <em>olifant</em>; then, turning his face
towards the Saracens, that Charles
and his men should say, on finding
him thus, that he died victorious, he
smites on his breast, and cries to God
for mercy. The memory of many
things then comes back to him&mdash;the
memory of so many brave fights; of
his sweet country; of the people of
his lineage; of Charles, his lord, who
nourished him; and then his thoughts
turn also to himself: "My God, our
true Father, who never canst deceive,
who didst bring Lazarus back from
the dead, and Daniel from the teeth
of the lions, save my soul! Snatch it
from the peril of the sins which I have
committed during my life!" And so
saying, with his head supported on
his arm, with his right hand he reaches
out his gauntlet towards God. S.
Gabriel takes it, and God sends his
angel cherubim and S. Michael,
called "<i lang="fr">du Péril</i>." By them and by
Gabriel the soul of the count is borne
into paradise.</p>

<p>Charlemagne has returned into
this valley of Roncevaux. Not a
rood, not an inch of earth, which is
not covered by a corpse. With a
loud voice Charles calls the name of
his nephew; he calls the archbishop,
and Gérin, and Berenger, and the
Duke Sanche, and Angélier, and all
his peers. To what purpose? There
are none to answer. "Wherefore
was I not in this fight?" he cries,
tearing his long beard and fainting
with grief; and the whole army laments
with him. These weep for
their sons, those for their brothers,
their nephews, their friends, their
lords.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this mourning,
the Duke Naymes, a sagacious man,
approaches the emperor. "Look in
front," he says. "See these dusty
roads. It is the pagan horde in
flight. To horse! We must be
avenged!"</p>

<p>Charles, before setting forth, commands
four barons and a thousand
knights to guard the field of battle.
"Leave the dead there as they are,"
he says. "Keep away the wild
beasts, and let no man touch them,
neither squires nor varlets, until the
hour, please God, of our return."
Then he bade them sound the charge,
and pursued the Saracens.</p>

<p>The sun is low in the heavens;
the night is near, and the pagans are
on the point of escaping in the evening
shadows; but an angel descends
from heaven. "March," he
says to Charles. "Continue marching;
the light shall not fail you."</p>

<p>And the sun stays in the sky. The
pagans flee, but the French overtake
and slay them. In the swift-flowing
Ebro the fugitives are drowned.
Charles dismounts from his charger,
and prostrates himself, giving thanks
to God. When he rises, the sun is
set. It is too late to return to
Roncevaux; the army is exhausted
with fatigue. Charles, with a mourning
heart, weeps for Roland and his
companions until he sinks to sleep.
All his warriors sleep also, lying on
the ground; and even the horses
cannot remain standing. Those
which want to feed graze as they lie
upon the fresh grass.</p>

<p>In the night, Charles, guarded by
his holy angel, who watches by his
side, sees the future in a vision; he
sees the rude combat in which shortly
he will need to engage.</p>

<p>During this time, Marsilion, exhausted,
mutilated, has managed to
reach Saragossa. The queen utters
a cry at the sight of her husband,
cursing the evil gods who have betrayed
him. One hope alone remains.
The old Baligant, Emir of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
Babylon, will not leave them without
succor. He will come to avenge
them. Long ago Marsilion sent letters
to him; but Babylon is very far
away, and the delay is great.</p>

<p>The emir, on receiving the letters,
sends for the governors of his forty
kingdoms; he causes galleys to be
equipped and assembled in his port
of Alexandria, and, when the month
of May arrives, on the first day of
summer he launches them into the
sea.</p>

<p>This fleet of the enemy is immense;
and how obedient to the sail, to the
oar, to the helm! At the top of these
masts and lofty yards how many fires
are lighted! The waves glitter afar
off in the darkness of the night, and,
as they draw near the shores of
Spain, the whole of the coast is illuminated
by them. The news soon
flies to Saragossa.</p>

<p>Marsilion, in his distress, resigns
himself to do homage for Spain to
the Emir Baligant. With his left
hand, which alone remains to him,
he presents his glove, saying, "Prince
Emir, I place all my possessions in
your hands; defend them, and,
avenge me." The emir receives his
glove, and engages to bring him the
head of the old Charles; then he
throws himself on his horse, as he
cries out to the Saracens, "Come, let
us march; or the French will escape
us."</p>

<p>At daybreak Charles sets out for
Roncevaux. As they draw near, he
says to those about him, "Slacken
your pace somewhat, my lords; I
would go on before alone to seek
my nephew. I remember that, on a
certain festival at Aix, he said that,
should it be his hap to die in a foreign
land, his body would be found
in front of his men and of his peers,
with his face turned towards the land
of the enemy, in token that he died
a conqueror&mdash;brave heart!" So
saying, he advances alone, and
mounts the hill. He recognizes on
three blocks of rock the strokes of
Durandal, and on the grass hard by
the body of his nephew. "Friend
Roland," he cries out in extreme
anguish, as he raises the corpse with
his own hands,-"friend Roland,
may God place thy soul among the
flowers of his paradise, in the midst
of his glorious saints! Alas! what
hast thou come to do in Spain! Not
a day will there be henceforth in
which I shall not weep for thee.
Relations still I have, but yet not
one like thee! Roland, my friend,
I return to France; and when I shall
be in my palace at Laon, people will
come to me from every quarter, saying,
Where is the captain? And I
shall make answer, He is dead in
Spain! My nephew is dead, by
whom I gained so many lands. And
now, who shall command my armies?
Who shall sustain my empire?
France, my sweet country, they who
have caused his death have destroyed
thee!"</p>

<p>When he had thus given free
course to his grief, his barons requested
that the last duties should
be performed for their companions.
They collect the dead, and burn
sweet perfumes around them; then
are they blessed and incensed, and
buried with great pomp, excepting
Roland, Oliver, and Abp. Turpin,
whose bodies are laid apart to be carried
into France.</p>

<p>They were preparing for departure
when in the distance appeared the
Saracen vanguard. The emperor tears
himself away from his grief, turns his
fiery glance upon his people, and
cries aloud with his strong and clear
voice, "Barons and Frenchmen, to
horse and to arms!"</p>

<p>The army is forthwith put in readiness
for the combat. Charles disposes
the order of battle. He forms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
ten cohorts, giving to each a brave
and skilful chief, and placing himself
at the head. By his side Geoffrey
of Anjou bears the oriflamme,
and Guinenant the <em>olifant</em>.</p>

<p>Charles alights and prostrates himself,
with an ardent prayer, before
God, then mounts his horse, seizes
his spear and shield, and with a
serene countenance throws himself
forward. The clarions sound, but
above the clarions there rings the
clear note of the <em>olifant</em>. The soldiers
weep as they hear it, thinking
upon Roland.</p>

<p>The emir, on his part, has passed
his soldiers in review. He also disposes
his army in cohorts, of which
there are thirty, as powerful as they
are brave; then calling on Mahomet,
and displaying his standard, he
rushes with mad pride to meet the
French.</p>

<p>Terrible is the shock. On both
sides the blood flows in streams.
The fight and slaughter continue without
ceasing until the day closes, and
then, in the twilight, Charles and the
emir encounter each other. They
fight so fiercely that soon the girths
of their horses break, the saddles
turn round, and both find themselves
on the ground. Full of rage, they
draw their swords, and the deadly
combat begins anew between them.</p>

<p>Charles is well-nigh spent. Stunned
by a blow which has cloven his
helmet, he staggers, and is on the
point of falling; but he hears passing
by his ear the holy voice of the angel
Gabriel, who cries out to him,
"Great king, what doest thou?"
At this voice, his vigor returns, and
the emir falls beneath the sword of
France.</p>

<p>The pagan host flees; our French
pursue them into Saragossa; the
town is taken, and King Marsilion
dies of despair. The conquerors
make war against the false gods, and
with great blows of their battle-axes
break the idols in pieces. They
baptize more than a hundred thousand
Saracens, and those who resist
they hang or burn, except the Queen
Bramimonde, who is to be taken as a
captive into France, Charles desiring
to convert her by gentle means.</p>

<p>Vengeance is satisfied. They put
a garrison into the town, and return
to France. In passing through Bordeaux,
Charles places upon the altar
of S. Severin his nephew's <em>olifant</em>;
there pilgrims may see it even to this
day. Then in great barks they
traverse the Gironde, and in S. Romain-de-Blaye
they bury the noble
Roland, the faithful Oliver, and the
brave archbishop.</p>

<p>Charles will not again halt on his
way, nor take any repose, until he
reaches his great city of Aix. Behold
him arrived thither. He sends
messengers through all his kingdoms
and provinces, commanding the presence
of the peers of his court of justice
to take proceedings against Ganelon.</p>

<p>On entering his palace, he sees
coming to him the young and gentle
lady, the fair Aude. "Where," she
asks, "is Roland&mdash;Roland the Captain,
who promised to take me for
his wife?" Charles, upon hearing
these words, feels his deadly grief
awaken, and weeps burning tears.
"My sister and dear friend, he of
whom you speak is now no more!
I will give you in his place a spouse
worthy of you&mdash;Louis, my son, who
will inherit all my kingdoms; more
I cannot say."</p>

<p>"These are strange words," she
answers; "God forbid, and the angels
and saints likewise, that, Roland
being dead, Aude should live!"
So saying, she grew pale, and, falling
at the feet of Charlemagne, she
died. God show to her his mercy!</p>

<p>The emperor will not believe but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
that she has fainted: he takes her
hands, lifts her up; but alas, her
head falls down upon her shoulder;
her death is only too true. Four
countesses are commanded to watch
by her all the night, and to cause her
to be nobly buried in a convent of
nuns.</p>

<p>While they are weeping for the
fair Aude, and Charlemagne renders
to her the last honors, Ganelon, beaten
with rods and laden with chains,
awaits his sentence.</p>

<p>The peers are assembled. Ganelon
appears before them, and defends
himself with subtlety. "I am
avenged," he says, "but I have betrayed
no one." The judges look at
each other, and are inclined to be
lenient. "Sire," they say to the
emperor, "let him live; he is a good
nobleman. His death will not restore
to you Roland, your nephew, whom
we shall never see more." And
Charles exclaims: "You all betray
me!"</p>

<p>Upon this, one of them, Thierry,
brother to Geoffrey of Anjou, says to
the emperor: "Sire, be not disquieted;
I condemn Ganelon. I say that he
is a perjurer and a traitor, and I condemn
him to death. If he has any
kin who dares to say that I lie, I
have this sword wherewith to answer
him."</p>

<p>Forthwith Pinabel, the friend of
Ganelon, brave, alert, vigorous, accepts
the challenge. At the gates of
Aix, in the meadow, the two champions,
well-confessed, well-absolved
and blessed, their Mass heard, and
their swords drawn, prepare themselves
for the combat. God only
knows how it will end.</p>

<p>Pinabel is vanquished, and all the
barons bow before the decision of
God. All say to the emperor, "He
ought to die."</p>

<p>Ganelon dies the death of a traitor&mdash;he
is quartered.</p>

<p>Then the emperor assembles his
bishops. "In my house," he says to
them, "a noble captive has learnt so
much by sermons and examples that
she desires to believe in God. Let
her be baptized; it is the Queen of
Spain." They baptize her, therefore,
under the name of Julienne. She has
become a Christian from the depths
of her heart.</p>

<p>The day departs; night covers the
earth. The emperor sleeps in his
vaulted chamber. The angel known
to Charles, S. Gabriel, descends to
his bedside, and says to him on the
part of God: "To the city which the
pagans are besieging, Charles, it is
needful that thou march. The Christians
cry aloud for thee."</p>

<p>"God!" cries the king, "how painful
is my life." And, weeping, he
tears his long white beard.</p>

<p>Here ends the song which Turoldus
has sung.</p>

<h3>THE FUR TRADER.<br />

A TALE OF THE NORTHWEST.</h3>


<p class="center">CONCLUDED.
</p>

<p>The next morning, at a very early
hour, it was apparent that an assemblage
of Indians at the council lodge
had been summoned, to consider the
proposal of the missionary. His
hopes were encouraged when he noted
that many of the old men and
earliest converts were mingling with
the fierce warriors and young men
of the vicinity, on their way to the
place of meeting.</p>

<p>After some time, a delegation, with
the brave who had borne the message
of the priest to his chief at their
head, proceeded with measured and
stately steps from the council lodge
to that of the missionary, where they
were received with the silent and
ceremonious solemnity so dear to
Indians.</p>

<p>The result of the debate, which
they communicated, was, that their
foes should be requested to meet
them&mdash;under guaranty of the missionary
for their good faith, and the
assurance that the injured party would
meet them unarmed, if they also
would leave their arms behind&mdash;that
the proposed council should be solemnly
held. Should its decision be
for peace, all should join in the pursuit
and recapture of the maiden; if
otherwise, time should be allowed
for the foe to regain their camps before
her people should take the war-path.</p>

<p>The trapper departed immediately
to proclaim these decisions in the
nearest camps of the hostile party,
and to secure their general diffusion
among those tribes. The missionary
soon set out to notify the residents
of other missions, after seeing that
the young chief had despatched runners
to summon a full attendance of
his own people and friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span></p>

<p>There is wonderful despatch in the
simple machinery set in motion by
the aborigines of our country upon
such occasions, executing their purpose
with a speed which proves their
ignorance of the wise "circumlocution
offices" of civilization.</p>

<p>Immediate preparations were set
on foot at the appointed rendezvous
for entertaining a multitude. Large
parties were sent out in quest of
game. The women of the vicinity
assembled to prepare the meats, the
<em>camash</em>, the <em>wappato</em>, and the bitter
root, for a great feast.</p>

<p>During the three days succeeding
the transactions related above, multitudes
were to be seen gathering
from all quarters, and taking their
course to the village where they were
to meet, in profound silence, and
with the grave composure befitting
an assembly before which the tremendous
issues of life and death
were to be discussed.</p>

<p>The trapper came with a large
party of the fiercest warriors whom
the wiles of the "Northwester" had
deceived. Several priests from scattered
missions, more or less remote,
with their converted Indians, arrived.
Numerous savages of both sides advanced
in parties by themselves, caring
for nothing but blood and plunder
should war be the word, or feasting
and revelry should it be peace.
French creoles, half-breeds, Canadian
<i lang="fr">voyageurs</i>, <i lang="fr">coureurs des bois</i>, and free
trappers, completed the list of this
wild and miscellaneous assemblage.</p>

<p>Arrangements were made with
great precision for the opening of
the council. When the council
lodge was in readiness, notice for
the assembling of the various delegates
was proclaimed from its roof
by an Indian crier.</p>

<p>The missionaries passed in first,
followed by the chiefs, and seated
themselves on a semicircular platform
slightly elevated from the earthen
floor at the further end of the lodge,
the priests sitting in the centre, between
the two parties, as umpires.
Then the elders, the delegates, and
the warriors took their seats upon
the floor along each side of the
lodge.</p>

<p>The oldest chief of the injured
confederates arose, and proceeded
with calm dignity to explain the relations
which the two parties, although
ancient enemies even unto blood,
had maintained with each other
since they had been mutually moved
by the message of peace, delivered
by the holy Black Gowns, to bury
the hatchet and live, as Christian
brethren should, in peace and amity.
He showed how faithfully those of
his side, on their part, had kept the
compact, depicting in vivid colors
their grief and horror at the perfidy
of their brothers, and the cruel
slaughter of their innocent and unsuspecting
friends. When he described
the ambush, the sudden attack,
the death of the old chief, and
the murder of his followers; the
plunder of their goods, the massacre
of the women and children, and the
capture of the cherished daughter of
her race, it was fearful to see among
the warriors the kindling passion for
revenge flashing from fiery eyes
which glared like those of the tiger
thirsting for blood, though their manner
remained otherwise cool, collected,
and subdued.</p>

<p>At the close of this harangue, he
called upon his brother,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> the oldest
chief of the opposite party, to reply,
and state what he could in justification
of their conduct.</p>

<p>With the same lofty composure,
the respondent recapitulated and
confirmed all that had been stated as
to the former enmity and the friendly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
relations promoted and established
between them by the labors and influence
of the Black Gowns.</p>

<p>He then set forth in glowing language
the dismay with which his people
and their allies had heard that
these their pretended friends were
joining among themselves and with
the new American companies&mdash;under
the sanction of the missionaries&mdash;for
their destruction and the possession
of their hunting-grounds. That
their good friends of the Northwest
Company had warned them of their
impending ruin, and furnished arms
and ammunition, that they might
avert the calamity by making the
first attack themselves. That this
was their sole motive for the act,
and in self-defence, for self-preservation,
they were ready to pursue the
war-path as long as a man was left
of their tribes to fight. But as to
the massacre at the encampment,
and abduction of the maiden, he indignantly
denied for himself, his
people, and their allies, all knowledge
of any such place, or aid in its fulfilment,
or of the instruments by which
it had been executed.</p>

<p>Convictions of the crafty fabrications
by which the Northwest Company,
through its wily commander,
had beguiled them, fastened gradually
upon the minds of both parties, as
their history was thus opened.</p>

<p>The missionaries now proceeded
to re-establish peace, in which they
were so successful that the calumet
was duly passed from one to another
through the whole assembly. Before
the close of the council the terms of
a new alliance were fully settled, and
all parties pledged to fidelity in maintaining
it, and diligence in seeking the
lost maiden.</p>

<p>Muttered threats were breathed
against the Northwest Company, and
especially its false commander, and a
determination to take his life vehemently
expressed. The missionaries
reproved these threats so sternly
that they were accused of befriending
him, and the trapper was again
obliged to exert all his influence in
quelling the rising distrust.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, preparations for a grand
banquet, after the most approved and
bountiful mode of savage magnificence,
had been going on, and the
village was redolent of savory odors
from every variety of meat and vegetables
in process of cooking according
to the Indian fashions.</p>

<p>The great assemblage regaled
themselves plentifully, but with staid
decorum. The mirth, the dancing,
and the songs, customary upon such
occasions, were omitted, out of respect
for the memory of the departed
chief and the sorrows of his son.</p>

<p>At the close of the feast, the Rosary
was recited by the missionaries
and their converts; after which the
parties who were to set out in quest
of the maiden were duly organized
and equipped with arms and ammunition,
procured for the purpose from
the nearest American station. These
were so dispersed as to surround by
a long circuit the principal trading
post of the Northwest Company&mdash;at
which the commander made his headquarters&mdash;and
draw towards it by
narrowing circles, to intercept any
party which might be sent to convey
the object of their search to some
other place should news of their expedition
reach the post before their
arrival. A runner accompanied each
party to notify the next of any important
incident touching the interests of
their expedition.</p>

<p>As they were patiently and gradually
converging toward their destination,
one detachment met a party of traders
from the Hudson's Bay Company,
who informed them that the
"Northwester" whom they sought
was absent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span></p>

<p>He had failed to meet them, as he
had agreed, to arrange terms of requital
with them for plunder committed
upon their territory by his agents;
and had departed a day or two before,
with a fleet of canoes and a
large party of <i lang="fr">voyageurs</i>, down the
river to an American station which
was commanded by a former partner
in his company, with whom he was
on terms of suspicious intimacy, considering
their rival interests.</p>

<p>There were a number of women in
the canoes, supposed to be the wives
of the <i lang="fr">voyageurs</i>.</p>

<p>This intelligence changed the
course of the expedition. The several
bands were notified, and united as
speedily as possible, to make their way
to the station indicated.</p>

<p>When they reached its vicinity,
they found a great carousal was on
foot there. The boisterous mirth and
revelry that prevailed made it easy
to reconnoitre without detection.
They soon discovered the quarters
where the women were assembled.
It was a large tent or camp, guarded
from intruders by a detachment of
<i lang="fr">voyageurs</i> and their wives. The
Connecticut trapper sauntered carelessly
up to one of the sentinels, and
began playing off some rough jokes
of the wilderness upon him, in the
mingled jargon of Indian dialects
and Canadian <i lang="fr">patois</i> used among that
class.</p>

<p>He found the fellow sulky and
silent; not too well pleased with the
duty assigned him, and impatient to
join the revellers. He very kindly
offered&mdash;"bein' a man of sobriety
and havin' no hankerin' for such
doin's"&mdash;to relieve the watcher, and
take his place for a time. As he was
a Yankee, who, as the Canadian
stranger supposed, might belong to
the station, he did not hesitate to accept
the offer.</p>

<p>From this tent, on the west side, a
patch of very high grass extended
to a dense clump of bushes at some
distance. After the new guardian
had surveyed the premises for some
time, with his habitual air of careless
indifference, he caught a glimpse
through the door, over which a buffalo
robe had been hung to close it,
of the woman who attended the
daughter of the chief. All doubt of
the maiden's presence vanished before
that vision. But how to give notice
that friends were near? Pacing slowly
back and forth close beside the tent,
he uttered distinctly, in a low voice,
the sacred name given the maiden in
baptism, and known to none here
but her attendant&mdash;"Josephine!" and
was delighted to receive a quick reply,
"S. Joseph!" He continued
pacing, and humming carelessly, in
her native dialect, a short of chant,
as if for his own amusement, the words
of which conveyed a distinct idea of
the grass and the bushes west of the
tent, and a hint that she could creep
through the one unobserved, and find
friends concealed in the covert of the
other.</p>

<p>Another sentinel accosted him, in
derision, as a "merry singer," when
he complained of this tedious business
of watching the women, and
wished the fellow he had relieved
would finish his frolic, and come
back.</p>

<p>"He will be in no haste to do
that," his companion replied. "Gabriel
is a sad gossip, and too fond of
the drinking-cup to quit it without
compulsion."</p>

<p>Our trapper, favoring the impression
this man also had received that
he belonged to the station, said he
must be released to meet an engagement
at this hour, or break the rules
of the post; when Gabriel's daughter
was called to go and summon her
father. An interval elapsed which
seemed an age to the trapper, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
wonted coolness almost forsook him
before the truant appeared, highly
elated with liquor, and loth to resume
his irksome duty.</p>

<p>The relieved sentinel vanished to
meet his "engagement," the result of
which was that the ground in the
high grass was speedily filled on both
sides with armed and prostrate Indians,
listening for the rustle which
would betray the presence of their
coveted prize.</p>

<p>Nor did they wait long; and, when
the maiden with her attendant crept
stealthily by them, she was informed
that a swift-footed pony was concealed
in the covert of the bushes for her
use. Her friends soon had the satisfaction
of seeing them mounted, and
flying, with the speed of the wind, in
the direction of their distant home;
for the trapper had found a moment
in which to direct her as to the course
she was to take, and the maiden was
no stranger to the use of the noble
animal, in the management of which
her people are trained from their infancy.</p>

<p>Scarcely were they out of sight
over the vast plain before their escape
was discovered. A wild sortie of the
revellers ensued.</p>

<p>The commander, with the friend
whom he was visiting, and his favorite
clerk, who was always with
him, mounted on swift horses, started
in pursuit of the fugitive, while his
followers engaged in a bloody combat
with her friends. The "Northwester"
was the first to descry her in
the distance, and his horse was gaining
rapidly upon her frantic flight,
when she suddenly changed her course
toward the river, which here rushed
through a gorge bounded by a precipice
on each side. Putting his horse
to its utmost speed, and shouting his
entreaties that she would refrain from
fulfilling the intention he too clearly
divined, he plunged madly on, reaching
the bank only in time to see the
pony struggling in the wild waters;
but the maiden had disappeared from
his sight for ever!</p>

<p>While he was still lamenting, with
frenzied exclamations, his own folly,
and the dire calamity in which it had
resulted, a pursuing party of her friends
arrived. It was terrific to mark the
fierce flash of eyes that fixed their
blazing regard upon him from all
sides, as his savage foes encircled
him!</p>

<p>He seemed too completely lost in
the tumult of his own grief, disappointment,
and passion to heed their
approach, or the imminent peril in
which he stood, as one after another
of the band drew up his rifle and prepared
to fire upon him at a word
from their leader, when the tall form
of the trapper stalked into the circle,
and his ringing voice gave the command
that was instinctively obeyed.</p>

<p>"Down with your rifles, ye bloody-minded
sarpints"&mdash;suiting a gesture
to the word, that was understood in
a twinkling. Then, addressing them
in their own tongue: "Are the red
men wolves, that they would drink
the blood of the pale chief without
hearing what he has to say? How
will they answer to the holy Black
Gown for the deed, or how will
they face the pestilence and famine
which will surely follow every life-drop
that flows from the veins of the
great medicine-man of the palefaces?"
he added, appealing to the faith
of the converted Indians, and to the
superstitions of the unconverted, and
whispering a brief sentence in the
ear of the young chief, who had been
maddened at the loss of his sister,
but was subdued by the presence
and words of the trapper. Then resuming
his own language, he said to
himself as if musing&mdash;indulging a
habit formed during his long and
lonely wanderings&mdash;"I'm willin' to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
own the chap has many ways that
a man of peace and justice like myself
can't approve by any manner of
means, for they don't square with
my notions of what's right. But it
may be more the misfortune of the
critter than his fault, seein' he comes
of them Britishers, whose blood, I
conclude, carries its pesky pizin
down from father to son to the third
and fourth generation, as the holy
commandments say both good and
evil is carried. But there's two sides
to every story, and I an't agoin'
to stand by and see the life of a feller-critter
taken, if he <em>is</em> a son of Satan,
without hearin' both. Them Injins
an't sich angils of innocence
either as to have the right to cast the
first stone at the wicked. I'm not a
prejudiced man, I hope, but 'cordin'
to my notion there an't a truer thing
in natur 'cept the Holy Bible&mdash;which
I take to be the truest of all&mdash;than
that they're a tarnal pack, take 'em
by and large, and 'ud ruther drink
blood than water any day, every mother's
son on' em, savin' and exceptin'
always&mdash;as lawyer Smith used to
say&mdash;the Flat-heads and the Pendorays,
who're 'bout the likeliest folks
I've met this side of the univarsal
world, and have as nat'ral a twist
towards Gospil light as the sunflower
has to the sun. But all this is neither
here nor there"&mdash;he said, rousing
himself from his soliloquy, which the
natives had heard to a close with quiet
gravity, being accustomed to his manner;
and, striding up to the "Northwester,"
who remained sitting motionless
on his horse, with his back to his
pursuers and his eyes fixed upon the
rushing flood, as if so petrified by
the shocking event he had witnessed
as to have eyes or ears for nothing else&mdash;"Are
you crazy, or a fool?" exclaimed
the trapper in a low voice
as he approached&mdash;"to sit here as
unconsarned as if you was in a
lady's parlor, with a hundred rifles
raised to draw your heart's blood,
and your long account with etarnity
all unsettled! What on airth is the
critter thinkin' of! Speak quick! or
I wouldn't give the glim of a lightnin'-bug
for all they'll leave of the
vital spark in your carkiss in less'n
the twinklin' of its wings; they'll put
daylight in its place, and your scalp'll
be danglin' from the belt of the young
chief in less time than it takes to
speak the words&mdash;a sight I should
greatly mislike, bein' a man of peace,
though no great admirator of your
race, any more'n I be of the Injuns."</p>

<p>Suddenly assuming the careless
manner natural to him, and turning
towards the maddened throng with
the scornful indifference which seldom
forsook him, and was the best
weapon he could have opposed to
the fury of his savage foes at this
critical juncture, the young man related
in a few words what had happened.</p>

<p>With a sneer of contempt, the Indian
appointed to speak for the band
replied: "Did the Great Spirit give
his bird wings that she might fly from
the white chief to the home where his
falsehood has sent her father? or is
she a fish that she may cleave the
waters of that flood and escape from
him? No, no, our daughter lives!
When the white chief says she went
over the rock, his words are to deceive;
and when he bewails the fate
of the maiden, he is making a false
face. He sent the horse over the
rock to blind the eyes of her people.
He has a long arm and a strong
voice, and can call his braves from
every covert. He knows where he
has hidden our daughter. But we will
follow him even unto the homes of
the palefaces, and lie in wait until
more moons are counted than the
hairs on his scalp would number, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
drink his blood at last. Our feet will
be swift to pursue and our knives to
find his heart, even to the piercing
of stone walls!"</p>

<p>"Lord give us patience with their
Injin nonsense!" the trapper ejaculated.
Then, speaking in their language:
"Will my red brethren waste
time in idle words like prattling women?
The white chief will go with
us to the lodge of the holy Black
Gown, whose words are truth, and
whose counsels are wise and just.
That's as true's you're alive, Hezekiah,"
he proceeded, resuming his
own tongue; and, as if moved by
an irresistible impulse&mdash;"Talk about
your Methodist preachers, your Presbyterers,
your Baptists, and all sorts,
who deny that these missionaries hold
to Gospel truth! But let 'em obsarve
how they follow out Gospel rules by
layin' aside all critter comforts, forsakin'
father and mother, brother and
sister, housen and lands, and, comin'
into these howlin' deserts, without
scrip or staff, wives or children, labor
with their own hands for a livin',
sharin' and puttin' up with all the
poverty and hardships of the shiftless
critters they come to teach&mdash;whose
souls, I make no dispute, are of as
much value for the next world, and in
the sight of their Maker, as if they
belonged to thoroughgoin', giniwine
Yankees&mdash;though their works don't
amount to much in this, even in the
line of their callin' in furs and sich,
at which a Connecticut trapper 'ill
beat 'em all hollow any day." Then,
suddenly recollecting himself, he again
addressed his wild companions: "The
Big Foot will pledge his own life to
his red brothers, against that of the
white chief, that he prove not false
in this matter; and they will let the
Black Gown say what his children
shall do."</p>

<p>After some consultation the proposal
was accepted, and without any
great delay they all departed in the
direction of the mission.</p>

<p>When the missionary had examined
the matter after their arrival, he
became convinced that the life of the
young commander would be in danger
while he remained within reach
of his exasperated foes, and would
hardly be safe in his Montreal home
from their revengeful pursuit. He
therefore advised him to leave without
delay.</p>

<p>The advice was scornfully rejected
at first, but soon perceiving that it
would be folly to provoke a fate
which flight only could evade, he
joined a party who were leaving for
Lake Superior, to proceed thence by
the usual route to Montreal, and was
seen no more in those Northwestern
regions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Many years had elapsed since
these events took place. A dark
and rainy night had succeeded a
tempestuous autumnal day, and settled
down like a wet mantle over
Montreal, wrapping the city in its
chilling folds.</p>

<p>The street-lamps with which it
was dimly lighted in the early evenings
of yore&mdash;when oil furnished an
obscure foreshadowing of this era of
gas, that served only to make "darkness
visible"&mdash;had gone out one by
one, leaving the narrow streets, with
their high stone houses overhanging
on either side, in utter gloom.</p>

<p>The twinkling of a lantern borne by
an invisible pilgrim might be seen&mdash;like
the transient dancing gleam of a
will-o'-the-wisp&mdash;revealing occasional
glimpses of a tall form by his side
clad in the habit of the Society of
Jesus. They were threading the
narrow course of old St. Paul Street,
which they followed until they
reached a road that turned and ascended
a rising ground to the west,
in the direction of a district where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
there had formerly been a beaver
meadow of considerable extent,
through which flowed a sluggish
brook, but which was rapidly assuming
the features now presented by
that part of the city lying in the
neighborhood of Beaver Hall Block.</p>

<p>Into this road they turned, and,
passing the district mentioned, took
a path to the left, which led them to
the base of the hill on the summit of
which the city water-works and reservoir
are now situated.</p>

<p>In those days the ascent was by
no means easy, and the aged father
had to pause frequently to take
breath during the course of it. Having
reached the height, and rested
for a brief space, they turned again
to the left into spacious, neglected
grounds, surrounding a very large
stone mansion which stood unfinished
on the side of the mountain, as entirely
isolated on that lonely height as if
in the midst of vast solitudes, instead
of the suburb of a populous and
thriving city. So chilling, gloomy,
and repulsive were all the features
of the lofty edifice and its bleak environs,
which had been an open
common for many years, that even
the reverend father, long accustomed
to encounter such varied forms of
desolation as the missionary in savage
regions must continually meet, recoiled
unconsciously as he passed
the dismal portal, which no door had
ever closed, into the damp atmosphere
within. Here the mouldy
walls appeared to give shelter only
to a multitude of owls and bats,
whose wings flapped indignantly at
the unwonted gleam of light in their
dark dominion, and equally rare intrusion
of a guest upon the silence
of their retreat.</p>

<p>The man with the lantern passed on
in advance, followed slowly and cautiously
by his venerable companion,
over a narrow platform constructed
by laying planks on the timber of
the framework, until they came to a
remote corner of the building, in
which a small room had been awkwardly
prepared, and arranged in a
manner to render it barely habitable.
A more comfortless abode could
hardly be imagined. Before the door
of this rude apartment they paused,
the guide inserted a key in the huge
lock, the bolt of which yielded slowly
as if fearing to betray its trust, the
door creaked harshly on its rusty
hinges and gave admittance to the
reverend guest.</p>

<p>Guided by the faint glimmer of a
taper&mdash;standing on a rough block
beside a bed on which the form of a
man tossing in restless agony was
dimly visible, the priest approached
the sufferer, addressing some soothing
words to him.</p>

<p>"Ah, reverend father! is it you?"
he faintly gasped. "It was kind of
you to come through the storm this
dismal night, and, after your long
journey, to seek the lost sheep so
utterly unworthy of your care! I am
near the close of a misspent and
wasted life! Will the worthless
wreck offered at the eleventh hour
in penitence and tears be accepted?
O father! how true were the
words you uttered when reproving
my sinful course: 'Unless you repent
the wrongs you have inflicted, making
such requital as remains within
your power, a fearful retribution
awaits you in this world, and eternal
despair in the next.' The first part
has been fulfilled&mdash;wife, children,
family, and friends have fallen from
me one by one, and for long years
the victim of his own folly and iniquity
has lingered on desolate and
alone&mdash;haunted by visions of retribution
and despair. But I have tried
to be contrite, and to offer such contrition
as I could gain, in anguish
and tears at the foot of my Redeem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>er's
cross. May I not hope it will
be accepted? How I have longed,
reverend father, for your return to
Montreal! The first emotion of joy
my heart has known for years was imparted
when I heard from my attendant
that you had at length arrived&mdash;just
in time to hear my last confession
and console my dying hour, if
there is indeed comfort for such a
sinner. The blood of that Indian
chief&mdash;singled first of all from his
followers for death by my command
(because he set his authority against
my designs)&mdash;and that of his innocent
daughter and her nurse, who perished
by my means, have set a burning
seal upon my guilty soul; while the
phantom of my injured wife, taken
from me while I was pursuing my
unhallowed passion, joins with theirs
to reproach and haunt me. I am
lost, lost in the horrors of remorse
for the triple murder, added to an
endless list of misdeeds!</p>

<p>"Peace, my son!" the reverend
father said tenderly and firmly&mdash;"though
your sins are as scarlet,
their guilt has not surpassed the
bounds of Infinite mercy! Nor has
it reached so far as you suppose.
The Indian maiden lives. A holy
nun in an American convent, she
has never ceased her supplications
for the salvation of your soul, and
for the pardon of her own weakness
and disobedience to her father, in
yielding her young heart's affections
to your importunities before she
learned, as she did on the voyage
down the river, that you were already
married, and sought only to make
her your dishonored dupe.</p>

<p>"She urged her horse over the
precipice according to instructions
from the trapper, who told her to fly
with all speed in that direction, and
at what point to turn to the river, if
pursued and in danger of being overtaken.
He also warned her to make
no resistance to the current, only to
avoid being drawn into whirlpools,
but to let it carry her through the
gorge to a place where the waters
spread into a small lake, on the shore
of which, near the foot of the gorge,
she would find a singular cave opening
toward the water, and easily seen,
where she must secrete herself until
he should bring her brother to her.
In all this she succeeded by the skill
in swimming which seems to be part
of an Indian's nature. When the
trapper and her brother sought the
hiding-place&mdash;with but faint hope indeed
of finding her&mdash;so great was her
dread of your power and of her own
weakness, that she entreated them to
keep the fact of her escape concealed,
and arrange for her departure with a
company of traders belonging to the
American stations, who were intending
to leave with their wives and
pass the winter in a distant city of
the United States. They therefore
left her, first providing means by
which her servant could obtain their
food; and after the return of the
party to me, those arrangements were
made. Upon her arrival in that city,
and delivery of a letter from me to
the superior of a convent there, she
was received into the house, and
soon after entered upon her novitiate
as one of its members."</p>

<p>"And now, my son," he continued,
"it only remains for you to prepare
for the solemnities of the approaching
hour, with deep humility and
contrition. I am sent by my Divine
Master to call, 'not the just, but sinners
to repentance.'"</p>

<p>The holy man remained with his
dying penitent through the night,
and, while the morning bells of the
city were proclaiming the story of
our salvation on the wings of the
<em>Angelus</em>, the spirit, so long perturbed
with agonizing throes of remorse, but
at length reconciled and refreshed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
the healing dews of divine grace,
passed to the tribunal before which
it had so dreaded to appear, trusting
solely in the merits of that Redeemer
born of a Virgin for us, and who was
now to be its Judge.</p>

<p>He was the first and last occupant
of the gloomy mansion that had been
designed for the abode of almost
regal magnificence. The phantoms
of horror with which his distorted
imagination had filled the vacant
spaces within those extensive walls,
and even the surrounding premises,
led him to confine himself entirely to
his room. And thus he lived for
years, a prisoner in that dimly lighted
and cheerless apartment, attended
only by the faithful servant who provided
his food, and haunted by dark
remembrances of the past.</p>

<p>The shadows of those visions still
linger around the empty walls, and
pervade the silent precincts, nourishing
a firm belief in the minds of
many that they are peopled by unearthly
forms, and investing them
with a mysterious influence that
keeps all intruders at a distance.</p>

<p>The Canadian driver, as he conveys
the stranger in his cab or cariole
to different points of interest about
the city, pauses a moment on the
height opposite the frowning mansion,
and points it out&mdash;standing in dismal
grandeur among the brambles
of its neglected grounds&mdash;with the
half-whispered explanation, "Yonder
is the Haunted House of Montreal."</p>

<p>We questioned the narrator as to
the fate of the Big Foot, and learned
that he made profession of the Catholic
faith soon after the departure of
the "Northwester" for Montreal; and
from that time until his death, a few
years later, attached himself to the
service of the missionary whom he so
venerated.</p>

<p>"And the confidential clerk of the
fur trader?" we inquired.</p>

<p>Rising to his feet, and drawing his
tall form to its full height, our narrator
replied, with a proud self-assertion
of which none but a Scotch Highlander
is fully capable, and which
no pen can describe&mdash;"I am myself
that clerk. His grandfather was
chief of the clan to which my family
belonged. When his father came to
Canada, mine came with him. I
was but little younger than this oldest
son, and we were brought up together.
When he was sent to the Northwest,
I was permitted to go with
him, and never left him until the
grave closed its inexorable door
between us."</p>

<p>He turned away to hide his emotion,
and left us pondering upon the
strange things that happen in this
world of ours!</p>

<h3>ARCHBISHOP SPALDING.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></h3>


<p>The late Archbishop of Baltimore
was an admirable type of a class
of Catholics, hitherto containing but
a small number of individuals, though
not without considerable influence
and importance in the history of
the American Church. Those of
our faith who have risen to the
highest distinction in this country,
either in the sacred ministry or in
literature, have rarely been what we
may call indigenous Catholics. By
birth or by race they have either not
been Catholics or not been Americans.
Immigration and conquest
are still the main dependence of the
young church of the United States.
What sort of fruit its own will be,
when it comes into full bearing, the
world has hardly had a chance to
judge. Abp. Spalding may be taken,
however, as a specimen. His ancestors
for several generations were
American, and, so far as the record
goes, they were never anything but
Catholics. They came from England
to America in the early days of the
Maryland colony, and were possibly
among the two hundred families
brought over by Lord Baltimore in
1634. They lived for nearly a century
and a half in St. Mary's County,
and thence Benedict Spalding, the
grandfather of the Archbishop, moved
to Kentucky in 1790. Benedict
was the leader of a little colony of
Catholics who left their native state
to seek their fortunes together in the
wilds of what was then the far West.</p>

<p>They settled in the valley of the
Rolling Fork River, in Central Kentucky,
not far from Bardstown, where
another offshoot from the Maryland
church had established itself a few
years before. There Martin John
Spalding was born, May 23, 1810.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Kentucky," says his biographer, "was
in that day covered with dense forests and
tangled woods. There was scarcely a
place in its whole territory that might be
dignified with the name of village, and
the only roads were the almost untrodden
paths of the forest, on either side of which
lines of blazed trees showed the traveller
the route from point to point.</p>

<p>"The forests were filled with a luxuriant
undergrowth, thickly interspersed
with cane and briers, which the intertwining
wild pea-vine wove into an almost
impenetrable network; so that, in
certain parts, the only way of getting from
place to place was to follow the paths
worn by the migrating buffalo and other
wild beasts. The Indian still hunted on
the 'Dark and Bloody Ground,' or prowled
about the new settlements, ready to
attack them whenever an opportunity was
offered. It has been stated on good authority
that, from 1783 to 1790, fifteen
hundred persons were killed or made
captive by the Indians in Kentucky, or
in migrating thither.</p>

<p>"In 1794, the Indians appeared on the
Rolling Fork, and killed a Catholic by
the name of Buckman. This produced
a panic in the little settlement, which
caused many Catholics to move for a time
to Bardstown, where the population was
more dense. But Benedict Spalding remained
at home, and the Indians disappeared
without committing further outrage.</p>

<p>"The early emigrants to Kentucky had
to endure all the hardships incident to
pioneer life. Even the ordinary comforts
were not to be had in the wilderness in
which they had taken up their abode, and
they not unfrequently suffered the want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
of the most indispensable necessaries.
To obtain salt, they had to go to the
Licks, travelling often many miles through
a country infested by savages. They
dwelt in rudely constructed log-cabins,
the windows of which were without glass,
whilst the floors were of dirt, or, in the
better sort of dwellings, of rough hewn
boards. After the clothing which they
had brought from Virginia and Maryland
became unfit for use, the men, for the
most part, wore buckskin and the women
homespun gowns. The furniture of the
cabins was of an equally simple kind.
Stools did the office of chairs, the tables
were made of rough boards, whilst wooden
vessels served instead of plates and chinaware.
A tin cup was an article of luxury.
The chase supplied abundance of food.
All kinds of game abounded, and, when
the hunter had his rifle and a goodly
supply of ammunition, he was rich as a
prince. This was the school in which
was trained the Kentucky rifleman, whose
aim on the battle-field was certain death.
The game was plainly dressed and served
up on wooden platters, and, with cornbread
and hominy, it made a feast which
the keen appetite of honest labor and
free-heartedness thought good enough
for kings."</p></div>

<p>Martin was sent to a school kept
by a Mr. Merrywether in a log-cabin
near the Rolling Fork, and soon distinguished
himself by his proficiency
in mathematics. He learned the
whole multiplication table in a single
day when he was eight years old.
At the age of eleven, he entered S.
Mary's College, near Lebanon, Kentucky,
being one of the first students
enrolled in that institution; and by
the time he was fourteen, he was acting
as teacher of mathematics, and
was famous throughout the country as
the boy-professor. From S. Mary's
he went, at the age of sixteen, to the
theological seminary at Bardstown,
then under the personal direction of
Bp. Flaget and his coadjutor, Bp.
David. Francis Patrick Kenrick
was one of the professors in this
home of learning and piety, and
soon became Mr. Spalding's intimate
friend. F. Reynolds, afterwards Bishop
of Charleston, was there, and
the Rev. George Elder, founder of
S. Joseph's College, was another of
the little company. Mr. Spalding
remained at Bardstown four years,
dividing his time, according to the
system pursued in several of our
American seminaries, between the
study of theology and the instruction
of boys in the college which
formed a part of the institution.
He paid no more attention to his
favorite science of mathematics, and
never developed the extraordinary
powers in that branch of learning
of which he had given such evidences
in boyhood; but his aptitude
for theology was so marked, and his
personal character so amiable, that
Bp. Flaget determined to send him to
Rome to complete his studies at the
Propaganda. It was a long and
rather difficult journey in those days.
He set out in April, 1830, and did
not reach Rome until August. On
the way, he visited Washington and
Baltimore, and made the acquaintance
of some notable persons, of
whom he makes interesting mention
in his letters of travel. He seems to
have been strongly impressed by the
Rev. John Hughes, afterward Archbishop
of New York, whom he met
in Baltimore; and he writes with patriotic
ardor of the venerable Charles
Carroll, of Carrollton, whose "good-will
and benediction" it was his fortune
to receive on the eve of departure
from his native land. Our
young Kentuckian, as might have
been supposed from his ancestry and
education, was an enthusiastic lover
of his country. "I am sure," he
wrote some time afterwards from
Rome, "that my attachment to the
institutions of my country has been
increased by my absence from it."
Nothing could exceed the warmth of
his enthusiasm for the sacred city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
and all its religious associations; but
he never forgot his home, and, like
most of his countrymen who have
been educated under the shadow of
the Vatican, he came back as ardent
an American as he went away.</p>

<p>After completing his studies with
brilliant success, and sustaining a
public defence of two hundred and
fifty-six propositions in theology,
church history, and canon law
against the most formidable adversaries
Rome could send to the encounter
(a highly interesting description
of which intellectual tilt is given by
Bp. England), he returned to Kentucky
with the title of doctor, and
was made pastor of the Cathedral at
Bardstown and professor of philosophy
in the seminary. His keen appreciation
of the peculiar needs of the
American Church is illustrated by the
zeal with which he immediately entered
into the scheme of his associates
in the seminary for the establishment
of a Catholic periodical. The
<cite>S. Joseph's College Minerva</cite>, to which
he became the principal contributor,
was a monthly magazine, which lived
for about a year, and was then succeeded,
in 1835, by the weekly <cite>Catholic
Advocate</cite>, of which Dr. Spalding
was chief editor, with Fathers Elder,
Deluynes, and Clark for his assistants.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"With Americans, Dr. Spalding used to
say, newspaper reading is a passion
which amounts to a national characteristic.
In the Propaganda the American
students were proverbial for their eagerness
to get hold of journals, whether religious
or secular. Now, he argued, this
craving must be satisfied. If we do not
furnish our people with wholesome food,
they will devour that which is noxious.
He believed the American people to be
frank, honest, and open to conviction.
Their dislike or hatred of the church he
ascribed to misapprehension or ignorance
of her history and teachings. Hence he
believed that if the truth were placed before
them plainly, simply, and fearlessly,
it could not fail to make a favorable
impression upon them. He therefore
thought that to the Catholic press in the
United States had been given a providential
mission of the greatest importance.</p>

<p>"Americans have not time, or will not
take the trouble, as a general thing, to
read heavy books of controversy. Comparatively
few Protestants ever enter our
churches, and, even when there, everything
seems strange, and the sermon intended
for Catholics most frequently fails
to tell upon those who have not faith.
And yet we must reach the non-Catholic
mind. 'The charity of Christ urges us.'
Apathy means want of faith, want of
hope, want of love. Besides, the church
must act intellectually as well as morally.
If it is her duty to wrestle ever with
the corrupt tendencies of the human
heart, to point to heaven when men seek
to see only this earth, to utter the indignant
protest of the outraged soul when
they would fain believe themselves only
animals, it is not less a part of her divine
mission to combat the intellectual
errors of the world. We observe in the
history of the church that periods of intellectual
activity are almost invariably
characterized by moral earnestness and
religious zeal. On the other hand, when
ignorance invades even the sanctuary,
and priests forget to love knowledge, the
blood of Christ flows sluggishly through
the veins of his spouse, and to the eyes
of men she seems to lose something of
her divine comeliness. Indeed, there is
an essential connection between the
thoughts of a people and their actions,
especially in an age like ours; and, if we
suffer a sectarian and infidel press to
control the intellect of the country, our
words will fall dead and meaningless
upon the hearts of our countrymen."</p></div>

<p>The Catholic press of America was
then in its infancy, yet Catholic controversies
were assuming a great importance.
The Hughes and Breckinridge
discussion was raging in Philadelphia.
Protestantism, alarmed
apparently at the rapid progress of
the American Church, was everywhere
assuming an attitude of aggression,
and the country was on the eve
of one of those periodical outbursts
of anti-Catholic bigotry which seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
fated to disturb every now and then
the course of national politics. Dr.
Spalding was fully sensible of the
wants of the day. He wrote frequently
to the Propaganda of the condition
of the American Catholic press
and his efforts to extend its influence
and direct its attacks. His pen was
incessantly busy. Though he was
personally one of the most amiable
and peaceful of men, he allowed no
assault upon the faith to pass unnoticed;
and his life for some years was
almost an incessant battle. The <cite>Advocate</cite>,
the <cite>United States Catholic
Magazine</cite>, the <cite>Catholic Cabinet</cite>, the
<cite>Metropolitan</cite>, were all enriched by
his contributions. He was one of
the editors of the <cite>Metropolitan</cite> for
several years, and, after the death of
the <cite>Advocate</cite>, he founded the Louisville
<cite>Guardian</cite>, for which he continued
to write until it was suspended in
consequence of the troubles of the
civil war. Dr. Spalding well knew
that, next to a newspaper, his countrymen
loved a speech. He resolved
that this passion also should be turned
to the advantage of the church.
Bp. Flaget had removed his cathedral
from Bardstown to Louisville, and
Dr. Spalding, being called thither as
vicar-general in 1844, began a series
of popular evening lectures with the
co-operation of the Rev. John McGill,
afterward Bishop of Richmond.
So great was the interest aroused by
these discourses, and so great the
crowd of Protestants who flocked to
hear them, that the Presbyterian,
Baptist, and Methodist preachers of
the city united in a "Protestant
League," to counteract the influence
of the priests by a series of lectures
on the abominations of Popery. The
result, of course, was exactly the reverse
of what they expected. The
weekly throng at the cathedral became
greater than ever. The lectures
assumed a more distinctly controversial
character. The Catholics
were roused to greater ambition.
For three years Dr. Spalding continued
his lectures every Sunday evening
during the winter months, composing
thus the essays which he afterwards
revised and published under
the title of <cite>Evidences of Catholicity</cite>.
In a very short time he was recognized
as one of the foremost Catholic
apologists of the day, holding
very nearly the same position which
Bp. England had occupied before
him, and in which the late Abp.
Hughes was so highly distinguished
in Philadelphia and during the earlier
part of his career in New York.
Dr. Spalding, however, was less of a
polemic than either of those great
men. His comprehension of the
popular wants amounted almost to
an instinct, and he felt that the objections
to the church which were
then commonest rested rather upon
historical and political than doctrinal
prejudices, and that the great work
of the Catholic apologist was to dispel
the ignorance of Protestants respecting
the faith of the middle ages,
the alliance of church and state, the
influence of the Papacy upon civilization,
and the harmony between
Catholicity and republicanism.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"An American, he knew his countrymen,
and admired them; a Catholic, he
loved his religion, and was convinced of
its truth. That, in his person, between
faith and patriotism there was no conflict,
was manifest. He loved his country
all the more because he was a Catholic,
and he was all the sincerer Catholic
because no mere human authority
was brought to influence the free offering
of his soul to God's service. He accepted
with cheerful courage the position
in which God had placed his church
in this young republic, and he asked for
her, not privilege or protection, but justice,
common rights under the common
law; and such was his confidence in God,
and in the truth of his cause, that he had
no doubt as to the final issue of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
struggle of religion, free and untrammelled,
with the prejudices of a people who,
however erroneous and mistaken their
views might be, were still fair-minded
and generous. Admiring much in the
past, he still did not think that all was
lost because that past was gone. Let the
old, he thought, the feeble, the impotent
complain; those to whom God gives
youth and strength must act; and the
church is ever young and ever strong.
God is infinite strength, and of this attribute,
as of his others, his spouse participates.
If the latest word of philosophy,
both in metaphysics and natural science,
is force; if the old theory of inertia has
been dropped, since the power of analysis
has shown that everywhere there is
action, motion, force, let it be so. The
church, too, is strength. She has a force
and an energy of her own. Daughter of
heaven, she has brought on earth some
of that divine efficacy by which all things
were made. Christ is the strength of
God, and from his cross he poured into
the heart of his spouse, together with his
life-blood, his godlike power....</p>

<p>"Without entering into the complex and
delicate question of the proper relations
of the church and state, he accepted the
actual position of the church in this country
with thankfulness and without mental
reservation. In this matter, he neither
blamed the past nor sought to dictate to
the future, but put his hand to the work
which God had placed before him. He
saw all that was to be done, and, without
stopping to reflect how little he could do,
he began at once to do what he could.
Taking a moderate, and possibly a just,
estimate of his own ability, he considered
that his mission as a writer and public
teacher demanded that he should be
useful and practical rather than original
or profound. Hence he neither wrote
nor spoke for posterity, but for the generation
in which he lived. His first aim
was to remove the prejudices which false
history and a perverted literature had
created in the minds of his countrymen.
The influence of the church on society,
on civilization, and on civil liberty was
wholly misunderstood; her services in
the cause of learning, of art, and of commerce
were ignored; her undying love
for the poor and the oppressed were forgotten."</p></div>

<p>During the Know-Nothing excitement,
which culminated after his
elevation to the episcopate (he had
been consecrated coadjutor to the
Bishop of Louisville in 1848, and
succeeded to the see in 1850), Bp.
Spalding's course was remarkable
alike for prudence, charity, and courage.
He used all his influence during
the riots in Louisville to restrain
the pardonable anger of the Catholic
population; and it is the testimony
of one who knew him intimately that
during those trying days, when Catholics
were murdered or driven from
the city, and houses were burned,
and the mob was threatening to
destroy the cathedral, "he manifested
a more than usual peace of
mind. He spent the greater part of
his moments of leisure in the sanctuary
in prayer, and seemed through
communion with God to grow unconscious
of the trouble which men
were seeking to bring upon the church,
and which he could not but feel
most keenly." His only great share
in the published controversies of the
period was a discussion with the late
Prof. Morse as to the authenticity of
an anti-Catholic phrase attributed to
Lafayette&mdash;a dispute which attracted
a great deal of notice while it lasted,
although, of course, the subject was not
of permanent interest. This, we say,
was his only direct share in the polemical
literature of that day; but
his collection of <cite>Miscellanea</cite>, which
appeared in 1855, answered all the
purposes of a formal discussion without
assuming a controversial tone.
The essays and reviews comprised in
this book were written, says the biographer,
in "a free, off-hand, straight-forward
style, peculiarly suited to the
American taste. They covered the
whole ground of what was then the
Catholic controversy in the United
States, and, by facts resting upon
unexceptionable testimony, by arguments
which appeal at once to the
good sense and fair-mindedness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
the reader, and by the whole spirit
and temper in which they are written,
furnish a defence of the church, as
against the attacks of her accusers,
the strength of which could not be
easily broken." Bp. Spalding had
none of the ambition of a scholar or
a man of letters. He cared nothing
for literary reputation. He set no
store by the graces of a polished style.
He wrote for present effect, and not
for future fame; and if his essays
could be read and discussed while
they were wet from the press, he had
no particular desire that they should
hold a place on the library shelves
of posterity. Whatever he wrote had
an occasional&mdash;we might almost say
an evanescent&mdash;appearance, because
his sole impulse in writing was some
immediate want of the American
church. His pen was powerful,
because it was always employed on
timely themes, and he had a wonderfully
happy art of suiting his style to
the tastes and capacities of his readers.
With all his scholarship and culture,
he spent no great pains upon
learned research, simply because he
knew that, under the circumstances
in which he was placed, such pains
would be wasted. His books, however,
will long survive the generation
for which they were written; and his
<cite>History of the Protestant Reformation</cite>
especially, though it is ostensibly
nothing more than a caustic review
of D'Aubigné and other Protestant
writers, is universally esteemed as
one of the most valuable works in
American Catholic literature.</p>

<p>If Dr. Spalding's single-hearted
devotion to the church was conspicuous
in his literary labors, it was
still more remarkable in the other incidents
of his busy career. The story
of his life is one long record of untiring
effort to advance the glory of
the church and extend her conquests.
The question of education always
engrossed a great deal of his care.
Soon after his consecration, he went
to Europe to obtain the services of
some teaching brotherhood, and succeeded
in securing a community of
Xaverians; and in the pastoral address
which, as promoter of the First
Provincial Council of Cincinnati, he
was deputed to write to the clergy
and laity of the province (1855), he
spoke with great earnestness of the
need of parochial schools; and time
after time he returned to the subject,
denouncing the system of godless
education, and urging the faithful to
fresh exertions and more generous
expenditure for the religious instruction
of their children. One result of
his opposition to the common-school
system was a vigorous controversy
with George D. Prentice, of the
Louisville <cite>Journal</cite>, in the course of
which the bishop reviewed not only
the Catholic position on the school
question, but the whole dispute as to
the bearing of Catholic principles
upon the social and political conditions
of the country. The foundation
of the American College at Louvain
was almost entirely his work.
The American College at Rome
found in him a firm and active
friend. In the Second Plenary
Council of Baltimore he proposed
the establishment of a Catholic university
in this country; and we
certainly can never forget the affectionate
interest which he manifested
in the Catholic Publication Society,
aiding it by his advice, his encouragement,
and his earnest recommendation
to the bishops and pastors
of the country, and writing the first
tract which appeared from its press.</p>

<p>After what we have said of his
devotion to the church, and the enthusiasm
with which he bent every
energy to her service, it can hardly
be necessary to explain with what
dispositions he took his place in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
Vatican Council. Strangely enough,
however, his relations with that venerable
assemblage have been somewhat
misunderstood, and his biographer
has been at commendable pains
to remove all mistake and obscurity.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Archbishop Spalding had always believed
in the infallibility of the Pope.
This belief was a tradition with the Maryland
Catholics, fostered and rendered
stronger by the Jesuit fathers, who for
so many years were their only religious
teachers. His fathers had taken this
faith with them to Kentucky. It was the
doctrine which he had received from Flaget
and David. Neither the Catholics of
Maryland nor their descendants in Kentucky
were tainted with even a tinge of
Gallicanism. Indeed, it may be affirmed
that, as far as we have a tradition in this
country, it is thoroughly orthodox. It is
the special pride of the American Church
that it has not only been faithful to the
Vicar of Christ, but has ever had for him
the tenderest devotion.</p>

<p>"'Thank God,' wrote Archbishop Spalding
to Cardinal Cullen in 1866, just
after the close of the Second Plenary
Council of Baltimore&mdash;'thank God, we
are Roman to the heart.' The confession
of faith of both the Plenary Councils of
Baltimore is as full and complete on this
point as it was then possible to make it.
When, after the convocation of the Vatican
Council, the question, whether or not
it would be opportune to define the infallibility
of the Pope, first began to be discussed,
Archbishop Spalding inclined to
the opinion that a formal definition would
be unnecessary and possibly inexpedient.
He thought that Gallicanism was dead,
and that Catholics everywhere believed
in the infallibility of the Holy See.
Hence, he argued, there could be no
necessity for a formal definition. He
believed, too, that much time would be
consumed in conciliary debate, in case
the question of fixing the precise limits
of Papal infallibility should be submitted
to the fathers.</p>

<p>"These considerations led him to think
that the most proper way of proclaiming
the dogma of Papal infallibility would be
to condemn all errors opposed to it; and
this was his opinion when he went to the
council. It was, however, merely an
opinion, formed, as he himself felt, without
a perfect knowledge of all the circumstances
in the case, and one which, upon
fuller information, he might see cause to
change. He was not a partisan. He had
in him none of the stuff out of which partisans
are made. He was simply a Catholic
bishop, who had never belonged to
a party either in the church or out of it.</p>

<p>"On the 27th of March, 1869, eight
months before the assembling of the
council, he wrote as follows to a distinguished
theologian who was at that time
in Rome:</p>

<p>"'I believe <em>firmly</em> the infallibility of
the Pope, but incline to think its formal
definition unnecessary and perhaps inexpedient,
not only for the reasons which
you allege, but also on account of the
difficulty of fixing the precise limits of
doctrinal decisions. Where they are formal,
as in the case of the Immaculate
Conception, there is no difficulty. But
are all the declarations of encyclicals,
allocutions, and similar documents to be
received as doctrinal definitions? And
what about the decisions of congregations,
confirmed by the Pope?'</p>

<p>"And again, in August, he wrote:</p>

<p>"'While maintaining the high <em>Roman</em>
ground of orthodoxy, I caution much
prudence in framing constitutions.'</p>

<p>"In both these letters, Archbishop
Spalding seems to take for granted that
a definition will be made; and he simply
indicates his preference for an implicit
rather than a formal definition.</p>

<p>"In August, 1869, two months before
leaving for the council, he wrote to Cardinal
Barnabo, giving his views on various
subjects which he supposed would
be brought before the fathers. One of
these he designates as 'The Infallibility
of the Sovereign Pontiff teaching <i lang="la">ex cathedra</i>.'
'I have not,' he says, 'the least
doubt of this infallibility, and there are
very few bishops who do doubt of it.
The only question which may, perhaps,
arise will relate to the utility, advisability,
and necessity of making an <em>explicit</em>
definition in the council. It will have to
be considered whether a definition of this
kind would not be likely to excite controversies
now slumbering and almost extinct;
whether an <em>implicit</em> definition&mdash;an
amplification of that of the Council of
Florence&mdash;which would define the dogma
without using the word, would not be
more opportune and of greater service to
the cause of the church.</p>

<p>"'Should the fathers deem it expedient
to make a formal definition, its limits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
should be accurately marked, and, in the
accompanying doctrinal exposition, statement
should be made whether and how
far, in the intention of the fathers, this
infallibility should be extended to pontifical
letters, allocutions, encyclicals, bulls,
and other documents of this nature.'</p>

<p>"This letter affords sufficient evidence
that Archbishop Spalding had all along
contemplated the contingency of an explicit
definition, and that he did not look
upon it with any alarm. In fact, he held
that a definition, either implicit or explicit,
was necessary. If he did not, in the
beginning, advocate a formal definition,
he was still less in favor of abstaining
from the unmistakable affirmation of the
faith of the church on this point."</p></div>

<p>He expressed his views more fully
in a <i lang="la">postulatum</i> drawn up after his
arrival in Rome&mdash;a document asserting
the infallibility of the Pope in
the most unmistakable manner, but
suggesting an implicit and indirect
instead of an explicit and direct definition,
because such a course would
be likely to command "the approval
of almost all the fathers, and would
be confirmed by their quasi-unanimous
suffrage." Soon after this memorial
was drawn up, Abp. Spalding
was made a member of the committee
of twelve cardinals and fourteen
prelates appointed by the Holy Father
to consider all <em>postulata</em> before
they were brought before the council,
and he consequently refrained
through delicacy from pressing the
consideration of his own scheme;
but it was energetically discussed in
various quarters, and Abp. Spalding
came to be looked upon as a leader
of the so-called "third party,"
which was supposed to hold a position
between the opportunists and
the non-opportunists in the council.
Meanwhile, it became evident to the
archbishop that, to quote his own
language, but two courses lay before
the fathers&mdash;either to place themselves
openly on the side of the Pope, or on
that of the opposition; and he wrote
a letter to Bp. Dupanloup, repudiating
the false construction which had
been placed upon his <i lang="la">postulatum</i>, and
the false inferences drawn from it,
and declaring himself emphatically
in favor of the plainest possible definition
of the doctrine. "When the
history of the Vatican Council comes
to be written," says an English author,
"not many names will be written
with more honor than that of
the wise and prudent Archbishop of
Baltimore; nor will any extra-conciliary
document be recorded in future
generations with deeper satisfaction
or warmer gratitude than the letter in
which Mgr. Spalding vindicated himself
and his colleagues from all complicity
with Gallican doctrines and
intrigues." In a pastoral address
to his flock, written immediately after
the definition, the archbishop made
a very clear statement of the doctrine,
and pointed out some of its
consequences. He answered the
objection that it was in conflict with
civil and political liberty, which he
believed could flourish only under
the shadow of the altar and the
cross, and he reminded his people
that the same theories of government
upon which the American republic
is founded were taught by the Catholic
schoolmen three hundred years
before Washington was born.</p>

<p>We have not attempted, in this
brief survey of the character of the
late Archbishop of Baltimore, to
sketch the incidents of his episcopate&mdash;and,
indeed, they were very few&mdash;or
even to enumerate the most important
works which occupied his busy
brain. Our purpose has rather been
to select from the valuable pages
before us a few indications of those
peculiar qualities of mind which
made him pre-eminently a representative
of the young and vigorous
American Church, so strong in the
faith, so ardent in attachment to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
Holy See, so reverent of Catholic
tradition, and withal so quick to
adapt itself to the special wants of
a free and growing country. We
would gladly have paused for a little
while over the attractive story of Bp.
Spalding's early pastoral peregrinations
through the primitive settlements
of Kentucky, his charity, his
gentleness, his love for children, the
touching scenes when he visited the
orphan asylums, in which he took
such a tender interest, or the beautiful
picture of the great preacher and
prelate sitting humbly in the school-room
with the little ones about his
knees. All this would draw us too
far away from our proper subject;
but we must allow ourselves one extract
from the few scattered passages
in which the biographer has told us
of his private life:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I shall never forget the pleasant journeys
which, when quite a small boy, I
had the happiness to make with him.
His merry laugh, that might have been
that of a child who had never known a
sorrow or a care, the simple and naïve
way he had of listening to the prattle of
children, the whole expression of the
countenance showing a soul at rest and
happy in the work which he was doing,
are still present to my mind, like the
remembrance of flowers and sunshine.
And I remember, too, with what warmth,
and reverence, and love he was received
everywhere, and how his presence was
never connected in my mind with anything
morose or severe. Eyes that
seemed to have looked for his coming
grew brighter when he had come; and
when he was gone, it was like the ceasing
of sweet music which one would wish
to hear always, but which, even when
hushed, keeps playing on in the soul, attuning
it to gentler moods and higher
thoughts. He was full of human sympathies
and human ways. The purple of the
bishop never hid the man; nor did he, because
he belonged to the supernatural order,
cease to be natural. There was, indeed,
a certain elegance and refinement about
him which no one could fail to perceive,
the true breeding of a gentleman; but
withal he was as plain as the simplest
Kentucky farmer. He rarely talked
about learned things; and when he did,
he did not talk in a learned way. He
possessed naturally remarkable powers
of adaptation, which enabled him to feel
perfectly at ease in circumstances and
companies the most dissimilar. There
was not a poor negro in his whole diocese
with whom he was not willing to
talk about anything that could be of advantage
to him. I remember particularly
how kindly he used to speak to the old
servants of his father, who had known
him as a child. He had a special sympathy
with this whole race, and I have
known him, whilst Archbishop of Baltimore,
to take the trouble to write a long
letter to an old negro in Kentucky who
had consulted him concerning his own
little affairs.</p>

<p>"He frequently wrote to children ten
or twelve years old, from whom he had
received letters. In company where
there were children, he never failed to
devote himself to their amusement, even
to the forgetfulness of the claims of more
important persons. When at home, he
usually passed the forenoon in writing,
or in receiving those who called
to see him on matters of business.
After dinner, he spent some time in
conversation, which he always enjoyed,
then withdrew to his room to say
vespers, with matins and lauds for the
following day. In summer, he kept
up an old Roman habit of taking a short
repose in the afternoon. He would then
walk out, calling in here and there to
visit some school or convent, or to spend
a few moments with some Catholic family.
On the street, he would stop to greet,
with a few pleasant words, almost every
acquaintance he chanced to meet. Frequently
he would remain to tea at the
house of a friend, after which he returned
to his room to write or read until the
hour for retiring for the night arrived.
The rule in his house was, that every one
should be in at ten o'clock, when the
door was locked. Apart from this regulation,
he never interfered with the tastes
or hours of the priests of his household.
In the cathedral, he had his own confessional,
and, when at home, he was generally
found there on Saturday afternoon;
and it was his custom to preach at the
late Mass on Sunday."</p></div>

<p>The Rev. F. Spalding, to whom
the task of writing this biography<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
was committed by the archbishop's
literary executor, had the advantage
of a somewhat intimate knowledge
of his distinguished uncle, and of free
access to manuscript sources of information.
He has done his work ably
and conscientiously, with an accurate
judgment of the salient points in the
story, and no slight skill in the arrangement
of his abundant materials.
His style is simple and unaffected,
and his whole book, from the first
chapter to the last, is thoroughly
readable; while, as a contribution to
the ecclesiastical history of the United
States, its value is of course very
considerable.</p>

<p>As a biography of an able and
successful prelate, whose career was
most honorable and useful&mdash;of a man
who was virtuous and holy from his
childhood to his grave, and who has
left a bright example of loyalty to God
and the holy faith of Christ in a corrupt
age&mdash;it is of greater value than
any similar work which has hitherto
been published in this country.
This great and holy prelate is worthy
to be classed among those noble and
illustrious rulers of the church in
past ages and the present whose history
is an ornament to ecclesiastical
annals. Apart from his career as a
bishop in the administration of the
important churches committed to his
care, his share in the successful issue
of the first session of the Vatican
Council and in that most auspicious
event, the definition of the infallibility
of the Pope, entitles him to the perpetual
remembrance, not only of the
American Church, on which he reflected
so much lustre, but of the
Catholics of the world. The history
of his pure and holy life, so highly
marked by devotion, integrity, fidelity,
and singleness of high purpose,
and closing with a death so beautiful,
ought to produce, as we hope it
will, a powerful and stimulating effect
upon the studious Catholic youth of
our country.</p>

<p>It is a great good fortune to a man
whose life is worth writing to find an
affectionate, just, and skilful biographer.
In this respect Abp. Spalding
has been more fortunate than those
other great ornaments of the American
hierarchy, England and Kenrick;
though we hope the lack may yet be
supplied in the case of these two prelates.
We have all along expected that
this biography would become very
soon one of the most popular, widely
circulated, and useful books which has
ever issued from the American Catholic
press; and we feel confident that
our expectation will not be unfulfilled.</p>

<h3>TRAVELS WITH A VALETUDINARIAN.</h3>


<h4>I.</h4>

<p>The summer solstice again, and
the metropolis an oven! Why should
I remain in it and be baked? There
was just one reason that detained
me: I could not make up my mind
to what point of the compass to
peregrinate. On my return from
last year's ramble, I had determined
to join an Alpine club on my next
holiday, and wander in search of the
grand in mountainous districts. It
only wants lungs and muscle, I
thought, and I considered myself
equal to the undertaking. The
smaller the quantity of luggage the
better, was my next reflection. But
I was completely put out of conceit
of Alpine climbing on visiting my
friend Mount. I saw Mount six
weeks ago, and all my calculations
of enjoyment were upset. Mount
was already in training for his journey,
as if for a boat-race; he was
eating, drinking, taking exercise,
gymnastic and pedestrian, and
sleeping just so many hours, to a
minute, on the most approved system.
Then, he had such a collection
of what he termed indispensable
companions for his travels&mdash;such
optical instruments, theodolites,
grappling-irons and sharp-pointed
staves, that I was persuaded that
his peace of mind would be endangered
in looking after them, to say
nothing of wanting a dromedary to
carry them. I, who never make
pleasure a toil, wished my friend an
agreeable time of it, and respectfully
declined participating. I am fully
aware that I shall be told by-and-by
that I have missed a great deal;
and I am equally sure that I shall
uncomplainingly submit to my loss;
but if ever I ascend mountains in
quest of the sublime, rather than
prepare so laboriously, I will charter
a balloon.</p>

<p>I was still negativing suggestions
that thronged upon me from many
estimable friends, and was still far
from determining my particular
destination, when I stumbled on an
agreeable, middle-aged bachelor acquaintance,
Mr. Stowell.</p>

<p>"I am rejoiced to see you looking
so well," I began.</p>

<p>"Appearances are deceptive, my
dear Lovejoy," he replied. "But I
am better, thank you. Ah! what a
blessing is health."</p>

<p>"It is, indeed."</p>

<p>"And yet how men squander it
away; yes, Mr. Lovejoy, squander
it just as they do money; and of the
two it is the more precious! It
should be an object of unceasing
care&mdash;to be husbanded with wise
frugality."</p>

<p>"Well, it is, sir, as you instituted
the comparison, to be treated like
money in certain respects. There is
an old saying that, if we look to the
pence, the pounds will take care of
themselves; and in like manner, if a
few simple regulations patent to every
one are attended to, health is to be
attained by the bulk of mankind."</p>

<p>"There, sir, excuse me, you are
wrong. I have made the subject
my study, and my conclusion is
that the matter is much more complex
than the care of pence. Consider
its conditions." And the
worthy gentleman told them off on
his fingers very deliberately. "There
is," said he, "proper nourishment,
temperance, exercise, repose, suitable
raiment, salubrious locality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
cleanliness, ventilation. And where
is the man who is mindful of the
harmonious working of all these
agencies; for the neglect of one of
them is mostly fatal to the rest?"</p>

<p>"Then, there are such a number
of complications in the constitution
of health, I think we must withdraw
the charge of squandering; for the
mass of men could never be hemmed
in by a series of sanitary rules only
partially understood and only partially
practicable, though they might
be like children throwing away treasures
without a knowledge of their
value. Squandering implies, to my
mind, wilful waste."</p>

<p>"No, sir; I maintain that squander
is the right word, and I accept
your meaning of it. I say it is every
man's duty to study health, and, if he
does, he will find the complications
I have spoken of exceedingly easy
of comprehension. But, sir, men
will not learn; they will put themselves
to no trouble at all; and they
squander their days away, because
they heed not the value of them.
Their daily conviction makes them
conscious of that value, but they stifle
it&mdash;yes, sir, they squander!"</p>

<p>"I will not argue the question
further. I perceive you have given
it more attention than I have."</p>

<p>"I own it, and I am proud of it.
And now, if you will add a favor to
the concession you have just made,
you will join me, be my <i lang="fr">compagnon
de voyage</i> out of this furnace, which,
we shall both agree, is only suited
to the constitution of a salamander."</p>

<p>"You flatter me by your invitation;
but I have not settled in my
mind what direction to take."</p>

<p>"Leave that to me, sir. If you
will gratify me by giving me the
pleasure of your company, I would
propose to change about from place
to place&mdash;now inland scenery, then
seaside, different parts of the coast,
a last view of the country rich in autumnal
tints, and then home before
Boreas is too rough for us."</p>

<p>"That will do admirably. You
speak like one who had well considered
his plans."</p>

<p>"I have, sir; it all comes under
the study of health."</p>

<p>"Really, you will make a convert
of me."</p>

<p>"All in good time. We will get
off first; let us start to-morrow, if
not too soon for you."</p>

<p>"With all my heart. I love
promptitude in action. But by land
or water? And whither?"</p>

<p>"We will take the Great Slaughterton
Railroad, in the first instance.
That's imperative!"</p>

<p>"My dear sir, there was a fearful
accident on that line only yesterday&mdash;a
hundred and sixteen persons killed,
besides loss of limbs, dislocations,
contusions innumerable!"</p>

<p>"The very thing for us! A nine
days' wonder! That line will be
particularly careful for a whole week
to come while the public eye is on
it. We shall be quite safe, sir; but
the earlier, the better. To-morrow,
then?"</p>

<p>Assent was given, and I was booked
for the Great Slaughterton. I
was a little startled at my friend's
precipitation, which seemed at variance
with his usual deliberation; but
he had given a reason for expedition
on the route he had selected, and,
on accompanying him home, I found
that his preparations had been made.
He showed me all the latest contrivances
for comfortable travelling, in
a variety of valises, portmanteaus,
leather bags, satchels, baths, and a
mahogany box which reminded me
of a liquor case or cabinet of choice
revolvers.</p>

<p>"You see I am all but ready,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Indeed you are," I replied.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
"But I shall overtake you, though I
have not begun to pack; for I travel
in a more primitive style. I leave
behind me all I can do without, and
trust to civilization to supply wants
that may come upon me. A purse
and the least possible encumbrances
are what I look to. You are not, I
suppose, going to burden yourself
with that mahogany case, though I
perceive it is labelled."</p>

<p>"My life-preserver, sir!"</p>

<p>"Oh! I thought it might be a
strong box for your valuables, and I
was about to suggest your entrusting
it to your bankers. We are not,
however, going into any dangerous
quarters where firearms...."</p>

<p>"No dangers, sir, while I have the
honor to be your guide! It is my
medicine-chest&mdash;an indispensable part
of my equipment!"</p>

<p>"Ha! You cannot trust country
apothecaries; and you, of course, understand
something of physic."</p>

<p>"A person at my time of life, sir,
is usually said to be a fool or a physician.
Not that I despise the faculty&mdash;we
may have to call in their aid
before we return."</p>

<p>"I hope not, Mr. Stowell; and
present appearances are not in their
favor, I am happy to say."</p>

<p>"You have not, I see, made health
a study."</p>

<p>"You have the advantage of me
there," I rejoined, as speedily as I
could relieve myself of the sentiment,
fearing another dissertation; and the
occurrence of the topic impressed
my mind with some alarm that our
difference of mental organism might
compromise our good-fellowship before
we came to the end of our journey.
Dwelling for a moment on
this idea, I thought I would venture
to insinuate terms of concord; so I
followed up my hasty remark by a
suggestion of mutual forbearance
while we were birds of passage.</p>

<p>"It may not be thought out of
place," I said, "if I take this early
opportunity of pointing out that our
minds do not work in the same
groove; and that we may find it
necessary to give and take, as the
saying is, while we shall be together.
For my part, I may claim a little indulgence
for some hobby of my own,
possibly; and I trust you will bear
in mind how completely I give in to
you on all that appertains to the laws
of health."</p>

<p>Mr. Stowell fidgetted about in his
chair, and seemed scarcely to take in
the scope of my observation.</p>

<p>"All I would recommend," I added,
"is that we should endeavor to
'play fair'&mdash;in our intellectual conflicts,
I mean. Let 'Put yourself in
his Place' be a lesson to each of us,
and I have no doubt that nothing
will occur to ruffle our temper or
lessen our enjoyment."</p>

<p>"Temper, sir!" replied my friend.
"I am glad you spoke of it. You
will only find me too much of a
lamb. I detest bickerings and disagreements.
No, sir, you will have
an easy time of it with me. A little
humoring of some whim of mine
might be judicious, not to say friendly;
but, beyond that, you will not
find anywhere a less quarrelsome
and more conciliatory being than
Benjamin Stowell."</p>

<p>"Then there is every prospect, I
rejoice to say for both our sakes, of a
lasting understanding between us."</p>

<p>"As firm and durable as adamant!"
exclaimed Mr. Stowell energetically,
emphasizing the remark by
a smart blow on the arm of his
chair.</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p>We started on the Great Slaughterton
Railroad next day, and it duly
consigned us to our destination&mdash;a
romantically situated town on a fine
table-land. The main street in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
town, at its extremity, commanded
an extensive view of a beautiful
country, which promised us some refreshing
breezes as they swept over
the expansive plains, and many shady
retreats from the fiery sun under
the umbrageous arms of lofty trees
that relieved the prospect from monotony.
We took lodgings, Mr.
Stowell undertaking to suit our tastes
and pockets in this important matter,
and claiming from the landlord several
extra indulgences without additional
cost, on the score of infirm
health. Our journey had been very
enjoyable, and it had sharpened our
appetites; for the prospect of a repast
after a good bath in a capacious
washstand, which seemed to cool the
atmosphere of each of our bed-chambers,
put us both in good humor.
Everything was well arranged, and,
in an incredibly short space of time,
we sat down to an excellent table
tempting us with its burnished silver
and its covering of whitest damask.
We both, as it seemed to me, did
justice to our meal, and I was a
little surprised, therefore, when my
friend exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Very provoking, is it not? Travelling
has a most peculiar effect on
me: it creates the semblance of an
appetite; but the moment I sit down
to eat, I have no relish for anything."</p>

<p>"Then have I made all this havoc?"
I inquired, with something,
perhaps, of a dubious air, pointing to
the reduced state of the viands.</p>

<p>"I don't wish to be rude, sir, but
I have been envying your enjoyment."</p>

<p>"I was sharp-set, I confess; and I
must have been too busy to observe
your inactivity," I replied, feeling
sure that Mr. Stowell's incisors had
been no more idle than my own,
and wondering what they would go
through when their owner gave them
their allotted amount of work on
a more favorable occasion.</p>

<p>"Always a small eater, sir!" remarked
my friend, speaking of himself
in a tone of regret.</p>

<p>"Little and often, perhaps?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Not at all, sir; loss of appetite is
one of my troubles. Weak digestion!
If you should be afflicted in that way,
I possess an excellent specific, and I
have with me one or two valuable
treatises on the stomachic functions."</p>

<p>"But have they not failed in your
own case?"</p>

<p>"They have lost some of their
efficacy, I allow; but they had a
marvellous effect at first. I take it,
all remedies wear themselves out, so
that we need continual change."</p>

<p>"Of diet?"</p>

<p>"Of regimen, sir! You will find
it so, if you will make health your
study."</p>

<p>"I won't dispute your conclusions,
but I am in the habit of leaving matters
to nature, and she has served
me hitherto excellently well."</p>

<p>"Very true; but she wants renovating
perpetually. It is fatal to
rely upon her unassisted efforts.
The artificial life we lead is too much
for her. Cooks have done for nature,
and doctors are called in to restore
her powers."</p>

<p>"But you would not physic a man
in health merely because he lives, as
is contended, artificially?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, most certainly! Prevention
is better than cure."</p>

<p>"I prefer to wait until a cure is
needed."</p>

<p>"Contrary to all sound system
when prevention is possible!"</p>

<p>"Your theory will make the fortune
of the doctors."</p>

<p>"A noble profession!"</p>

<p>Mr. Stowell now suggested a walk,
which had my advocacy, and we
sallied out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span></p>

<p>"We will allow ourselves exactly
one hour," said my friend, taking out
his watch. "I go on system, as you
will see. Now, which way is the
wind? Westerly. Ay, that will do!"</p>

<p>"A very fine evening! We shall
be able to proceed down the chief
thoroughfare, and go a little distance
on the high-road beyond."</p>

<p>"No, sir, we shall have the wind
in our teeth!"</p>

<p>"It is too balmy to hurt us!"</p>

<p>"I am not sure of that. I never
face the wind if I can help it. I
have known numberless evils result
from a little want of attention to such
an apparently insignificant point."</p>

<p>Accordingly, we took a northerly
direction, and we were rewarded
with a sight of some beautiful scenery
on that side of the town, so that
the caprices of my friend caused me
no disappointment.</p>

<p>We returned to our lodgings after
a most delightful stroll of an hour
and a quarter. Mr. Stowell looked
at his watch with a dissatisfied air.</p>

<p>"I must be aware of you," he
said, "a second time; you have beguiled
me into a transgression. I
am not angry, sir, not angry, but I
shall feel the effect of it."</p>

<p>"Pray, what have I done?"</p>

<p>"Sir, you have talked me into at
least fifteen minutes' excess beyond
my regular exercise. I shall suffer
for it."</p>

<p>"Do not blame me. Say, rather,
that the freshness and novelty of
the scenery have led us astray. You
are not tired?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. But I ought to be!"</p>

<p>"Then I will prophesy that you
will not come to harm."</p>

<p>"Were you not to give in to me
in all matters appertaining to health?
Don't contradict me again, I beg.
I know my own constitution so thoroughly.
I shall not be able to sleep
without an opiate!"</p>

<p>"I am sorry to hear that; but let
me suggest your first trying the effect
of the change of air?"</p>

<p>"Really, sir, you are ignorantly
striving to undermine the study of
my life. Don't suppose for an instant
that any scenery would keep
me on my legs five minutes past my
time, or that air has anything to do
with provoking sleep. In primitive
times, such might have been the
case, and it may be so even now
with juveniles; but too much artificiality
surrounds adults. I shall be
obliged to have recourse to my chest,
and I shall give you a treat when I
open it for inspection. It <em>is</em> a <i lang="la">multum
in parvo</i>! Make your mind
quite easy that, come what will, I
have almost every remedy, not merely
within call, but within reach.
There's consolation for you!"</p>

<p>I bowed my acknowledgment,
which I could not find words, I own,
to express.</p>

<p>Presently my friend proposed that
we should have half an hour's reading;
and, on his asking me if I had any
skill in elocution, I replied that, having
some taste for it, I should be
happy to read aloud to him, if it
would afford him any pleasure.</p>

<p>"Well, you won't be offended," he
said, "if I ask you to stop, should I
not like your style?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not&mdash;the moment I fatigue
you," I replied.</p>

<p>"And on no account exceed half
an hour. Never mind breaking off
in a fine passage&mdash;we can have that
another time; but I could not endure
a book more than thirty minutes,
not even a newspaper, which,
for diversity of contents, perhaps is
the best kind of reading."</p>

<p>I accepted the conditions, and,
finding a volume of <cite>Montaigne's Essays</cite>
on a shelf, I took it down, and
raised the question whether the old
Gascon would be to my companion's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
taste. He replied in the affirmative,
and declared his conviction that the
art of essay-writing was lost, and
that no essayist was comparable to
Montaigne. So lively an author he
could hear, he continued, with a good
deal of enthusiasm, for the allotted
time, with the greatest pleasure and
without a yawn.</p>

<p>Fortunate in the selection of my
author, I opened the volume without
looking for any particular subject&mdash;for
we both agreed that it was impossible
to alight on a dull place&mdash;and commenced
reading.</p>

<p>"Capital!" exclaimed my friend, in
less than five minutes. "Capital!
What a marvellous digestion that
man must have had! You can see it
in the clearness of his ideas! Let's
see, he was before Galen, wasn't
he? Go on, don't let me interrupt
you; we will settle these points afterwards.
Don't forget what just occurred
to me about his digestion&mdash;it's
important. You may not think so,
ha! ha! but I know. Don't stop."
And he composed himself as if for
attentive listening, with his head
thrown back in his chair, and his
arms folded across his broad chest.</p>

<p>I had paused during this slight interruption,
but, at the bidding of my
companion, resumed our essay. Mr.
Stowell seemed deep in thought as I
occasionally caught sight of him, but,
becoming more and more interested
in my author, I glanced at him less
frequently. Mr. Stowell's watch lay
on the table before me, probably
with a view of confining the lecture
within the stipulated limits. My eye
noted the hour as I progressed. I
had been reading exactly twenty
minutes&mdash;two-thirds of my prescribed
time. I proceeded a few minutes
longer, forgetful of everything but
the book, which was enchaining my
attention. A hoarse noise came from
my friend's chair on the opposite
side of the table. I was too busy to
look up, and the noise grew louder
and thicker. Was it possible? Was
that the heavy breathing of my
friend, yielding to the influence of the
air and our lively Gascon? Another
volume, not of print, but of
sound, and it was an unmistakable
snore! I raised my eyes, and there
was my friend fast asleep.</p>

<p>I read on until my time was up,
lest the cessation of my voice should
disturb his slumbers. When my
half-hour had fairly expired, I satisfied
myself that neither the stoppage
of any accustomed sound nor the
raising of an uncommon one had
any effect on the sleeper, so securely
was he locked in the arms of Morpheus.</p>


<h4>III.</h4>

<p>For the next two hours I read to
myself, but there was no change in
the attitude of my friend, unless he
had become more musical in the
double bass of his nasal intonations.
A reflection crossed my mind. Was
I not in a dilemma? Mr. Stowell had
fallen to sleep without his opiate!
He would be very testy at finding
his theory at fault, and an ignoramus
like myself right! It was dangerous
to awake him; and, if I allowed him
to sleep on, he would be angry when
he awoke to discover that he was not
in bed.</p>

<p>Twelve o'clock struck. I continued
reading. One o'clock struck,
two, three&mdash;no change! Four
o'clock! Montaigne had deeply interested
me, but at last I was tired
and inclined to rest. Should I retire?
Was my freedom of action gone? I
did not wish to be thought inconsiderate,
but was I shackled by the
companionship of a middle-aged
bore? Again I took refuge in my
book. Five o'clock&mdash;broad daylight
again! Seven hours' sleep for Mr.
Stowell, and not a wink for me! I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
could put up with it no longer. I
called to him by name, shouted,
whistled, walked about, treading
heavily on the floor. To no purpose.
I opened the window, and let in the
streaming sun and the refreshing
morning breeze. An extra snort
from Mr. Stowell, nothing more!
At length I repaired to my chamber,
which adjoined our sitting apartment.
I had just undressed, when my friend
was evidently on his legs.</p>

<p>"What a bore!" I overheard him
exclaim. "I told him not to read
more than half an hour, and he must
have prosed on till dawn. I must be
rid of him!"</p>

<p>"Thank heaven!" was on my
lips, when he slammed the door of his
chamber with great violence. Here
is a recompense, I thought, for obliging
a friend.</p>

<p>We were late at breakfast. I was
taking my seat at the breakfast-table,
when Mr. Stowell savagely accosted
me.</p>

<p>"I am a lamb in temper, but I
can't stand this, Mr. Lovejoy! I
will thank you to read to yourself
another evening. A pretty thing to
keep me up, and then leave me exposed
to the chill dews!"</p>

<p>I restrained myself as a man does
with right on his side.</p>

<p>"I read at your request," I calmly
replied, "and not a moment longer
than you desired. I remained up
with you until five, not liking to disturb
you. It is I, sir, who have reason
to complain."</p>

<p>"I don't care. I won't have it.
If there is one thing I detest, it is
being up all night! Young men can
do without sleep; my constitution
requires full seven&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hours' sleep, and, to my positive
knowledge, it had it; while I have
not had three."</p>

<p>"A dog sleep, sir&mdash;an unnatural
sleep, sir&mdash;no sleep at all, sir. I shall
feel the want of rest for days to come.
Ha! I know why it was: you
thought to deprive me of my opiate!
But I understand my constitution.
I will have my opiate in spite of you.
You compel me to have recourse to
my chest. I should but for you have
made up my morning's prescription
overnight. It must be taken fasting."</p>

<p>Patiently I listened to this tirade,
and did not condescend to answer.
Mr. Stowell brought out his medicine-chest,
and busied himself for some
time in weighing and pounding. At
length he gulped down some kind of
mixture. I occupied myself meanwhile
with the morning paper. The
mixture or its preparation had one
good effect&mdash;it restored my friend's
good humor.</p>

<p>"There, I will not be angry; I
never am; I cannot be. I wish you
would let me recommend you a dose.
I will mix it directly; I will, indeed.
It will do you a wonderful amount of
good."</p>

<p>The offer I politely declined.</p>

<p>"I see," he continued, "you have
lost your temper. Now, what can I
do to recover it?" His eye then
caught a programme of a morning
concert on the table. "The very
thing!" he added. "This very day!
We'll go! Let me persuade you.
'Music hath charms, etc.' Say yes,
and oblige me."</p>

<p>Not wishing to appear churlish, I
assented, simply pointing out that
the thermometer would range high
in a concert-room. My objection
was overruled, and we both sat down
to breakfast. I was glad to see my
friend enjoy his meal with what I
thought a decided relish, for he had
been very actively employed; and I
was on the point of asking whether
his mixture had not produced an excellent
appetite, when he amused me
by saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span></p>

<p>"Positively, I never <em>can</em> take a
breakfast! Everything very tempting,
though. But then, want of sleep!
Ah! I can't get over that."</p>

<p>By this time, I knew better than to
contradict my friend, and I suffered
his remarks, therefore, to pass unchallenged.
In due time, we went to
the concert. Several songs by distinguished
artists were sung, the chief
burden of them being the pleasures
of summer, bright, sunny days, golden
dawns, and glorious eves. These
appropriate subjects and the heat of
the room made me sigh for some
shady retreat under a leafy canopy,
such as had charmed my eye during
our saunter of the previous evening.
The concert came to an end.</p>

<p>"Do you know," said my friend,
when we found ourselves in the open
air, "I don't much care for music?"</p>

<p>"Not on a hot day, perhaps," I
replied.</p>

<p>"No, sir, it is not that; but I have
turned the occasion to some profit."</p>

<p>"I am glad of it."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I shall write an article
for the <cite>Medico-Chirurgical Observer</cite>.
I am convinced that vocalization injures
the larynx. I can prove it. The
demonstration became quite painful
at last, but I sat it out."</p>

<p>"Then we may bless our stars that
we are not singers?"</p>

<p>"We may, indeed! A fatal gift."</p>

<p>"I will wait to see you in type," I
remarked, in the expectation of closing
a discussion which began to appal
me.</p>

<p>On our return, we encountered a
strange-looking individual habited in
a very long coat, and wearing a hat
with a brim of extraordinary breadth.
Mr. Stowell let this oddity pass, then
stopped and looked after him. A
youth approached us as we tarried.
Mr. Stowell beckoned to him.</p>

<p>"Pray, who is that gentleman?" he
asked the boy.</p>

<p>"Dr. Brambleton, if he be a doctor,"
said the boy.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said my friend to
his informant; then, turning to me, he
added, "A most remarkable man, I
am sure!"</p>

<p>"An empiric," I suggested. "I
saw his gout specifics, and a column
of his testimonials in to-day's paper."
I laughed slightly, then exclaimed,
"Only one more infallible cure for
gout!"</p>

<p>Mr. Stowell looked very grave, and
the boy, who lingered to hear our remarks,
ran off, cackling a good imitation
of "quack, quack" as he went
along.</p>

<p>"That's all prejudice," said Stowell.
"He, Dr. B., may be a benefactor
of his race. I say he <em>may</em> be;
but I am certain of this&mdash;I felt some
singular twinges in my big toe while
we were on the Great Slaughterton,
and I have not been entirely free
from them since."</p>

<p>"You are not a gouty subject?"</p>

<p>"I can't say what I may come to.
I should very much like some talk
with Dr. Brambleton."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, my dear sir."</p>

<p>"I am only curious to hear what
he would say. I could tell in a minute
whether he was a pretender."</p>

<p>Mr. Stowell now labored under an
itching desire to call in Dr. Brambleton,
and I continued to combat his
folly, as I conceived it. Nothing
else for the remainder of the day was
talked about except various human
ailments, their propagation, and the
means of their eradication. It was
impossible to turn the conversation
into any other channel. I was so
worn out at last that my replies became
shorter and less courteous. I
grew dogmatic in my turn, and backed
my objections with more force as
I plunged into topics out of my
depth. Mr. Stowell was now frantic,
and abused my ignorance. I retort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>ed
by ridiculing his credulity. We
got so personal in our remarks that
it was a relief when bedtime came;
and we retired to our respective chambers
in no very pleasant mood.</p>

<p>That night, a thunder-storm broke
over the town. The storm was succeeded
by a sudden fall in the temperature,
and the air became as cold
as it is sometimes in the early spring.
A sharp easterly wind was blowing
when I arose the following morning.
Before I left my chamber, I heard
Mr. Stowell in altercation with our
landlord.</p>

<p>"I told you I was in infirm health,"
said Stowell.</p>

<p>"You did, sir," replied the landlord.</p>

<p>"Then, how could you put me in
a room with an easterly aspect?"</p>

<p>"Why did you not choose the
other room?"</p>

<p>"Because some people know how
to take care of themselves."</p>

<p>At this I opened my door, and
rushed into our sitting-room.</p>

<p>"Mr. Stowell," I exclaimed, "I
am not accustomed to have ungenerous
reflections cast upon me. The
choice was your own; but you have
before expressed a wish to be rid of
me, and I reciprocate the sentiment.
My room is at your service; I shall
not inflict my society on you any
longer, and I shall seek more genial
companionship than I have found in
a confirmed valetudinarian."</p>

<p>Without waiting for an answer, I
hurried out of the house, breakfasted
at a hotel, conned the newspaper,
and proceeded to the railroad depot,
partly for a walk, and partly to make
sure of the time of arrival of the "up"
train. I did not return to my lodgings
until just in time to take away
my luggage.</p>

<p>In the sitting-room, I found Mr.
Stowell and Dr. Brambleton. Mr.
Stowell was sitting on a chair, with
his bare feet on what I took to be an
electric battery, but which resembled
a coal-scuttle. He held a wire in his
hands, and on his head he wore a
cap encircled, as I supposed, with
magnets.</p>

<p>"Good-day," I said, in a conciliating
tone, as I was on the wing, and
my fancy was tickled at the ridiculous
appearance of my friend.</p>

<p>"Don't think any more of it," replied
Mr. Stowell. "My temper
emanated from gout! My first attack,
I assure you."</p>

<p>"A most decided case!" chimed
in Dr. Brambleton. "But he bears
it like a Job."</p>

<p>"A speedy recovery!" I answered.
"You are in good hands, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Excellent," said Mr. Stowell. "I
have the fullest confidence."</p>

<p>"He knows where he is, sir," put
in the doctor slyly. "But I will
stake my reputation on a cure."</p>

<p>And wishing the patient and doctor
a final adieu, I departed, rejoicing
in my deliverance from both quacks
and quacked. I should distinguish
myself in Alpine climbing while under
the stimulus imparted by freedom
regained; but experience will make
me wary of a travelling companion
until I have tested his congeniality
of disposition.</p>

<h3>MADAME DE STAËL.</h3>


<p>Anne Louise Germaine Necker,
Baronne de Holstein-Staël, the
most remarkable female writer of our
century, was born at Paris on the
22d April, 1766. At that time her father
was very far removed from the
high position he was one day to occupy,
being simply a clerk in Thelluson's
bank. Mme. Necker herself undertook
the education of her daughter&mdash;a
task for which she was singularly
unfitted, being cold and stern by
nature, and a pedant to boot.</p>

<p>M. Necker was much more loved
by his child, and he understood
her disposition better. He liked to
draw her out and make her talk, and
for that purpose he used playfully to
tease her: she invariably met him
with that mixture of gaiety and tenderness
which characterized their intercourse.
Deeply grateful for his
affection, Anne put the utmost good-will
in the execution of his slightest
wish. When only ten years old, she
was so struck by the admiration he
showed for Gibbon the historian, that
the idea occurred to her to marry
him, and thereby secure to her father
the constant presence of one whose
conversation he so much appreciated.
Undismayed by Gibbon's repulsive
ugliness, the child actually made
the proposal to him herself. What
makes the comical incident more
curious is the fact that her mother
had been, when little more than a
child, Gibbon's first love. It was
said of Anne Necker that she had
always been young, and yet had
never been a child. Her favorite
pastime was fashioning doll kings and
queens, and making them act tragedies
of which she improvised the various
parts. This innocent amusement
was at last forbidden by her Calvinistic
mother, but Anne used to hide
herself and carry on her dramatic
little games in secret.</p>

<p>In her mother's <i lang="fr">salon</i>, Anne early
made the acquaintance of some of
the clever men of the day&mdash;amongst
others, Grimm, Marmontel, and the
Abbé Raynal. At the age of nineteen
her intellectual faculties had become
developed in the highest degree, but
so much to the detriment of her
health as to cause the greatest alarm
to her parents. The famous Dr.
Tronchin was called in, and ordered
the young invalid to be taken to the
country, where the mind should lie
fallow, and the time hitherto devoted
to study be spent in the open air.
No prescription could have been
more unwelcome to Mme. Necker,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
for it involved a relaxation, or rather
a complete abandonment, of the severe
<i lang="fr">régime</i> she had adopted for her
daughter. As it turned out, this was
the best thing that could have happened.
Instead of hardening into a
learned prodigy, Anne's moral nature
was allowed to put forth its full
luxuriance. Her father came constantly
to St. Ouen, and in the
charms of his daughter's society he
sought rest from the cares of the
ministry. In this pleasant retreat he
and Anne learned, if possible, to love
each other better. M. Necker was
not, however, a foolishly fond parent;
his tenderness never obscured his
judgment; and Anne declared herself
that his eye, so far from being
blinded by affection, was quicker to
detect her faults than her merits.
"He unmasked all affectation in me,"
she writes; "from living with him,
I came to believe that people could
see clearly into my heart."</p>

<p>Anne made her <i lang="fr">entrée</i> into society at
an early age, and immediately assumed
there the position her talents
merited. As the daughter of a powerful
minister, and a future heiress,
it was supposed she would marry at
once, but it was not so. Mlle. Necker
attained the in those days comparatively
mature age of twenty before she
gave her hand to the Baron de Staël-Holstein,
ambassador from the court
of Sweden.</p>

<p>Immediately after her marriage,
the Baronne de Staël was presented
at court. On this occasion she acquired
a character for eccentricity by
omitting one of the innumerable
court courtesies; but what stamped
her irrevocably as an oddity was that,
going a few days later to visit the
Duchesse de Polignac, the young
baroness walked into the room without
her head-dress&mdash;she had dropped
it in the carriage. Those who were inclined
to laugh at her, however, soon
desisted, seeing that she was herself
the first to relate her misdemeanors,
and to laugh at them.</p>

<p>But a great event was at hand
which was to turn the current of
Mme. de Staël's thoughts into other
channels: the French Revolution
broke out. The daughter of the
minister who was the immediate
cause of that volcanic eruption was
not likely to remain a cool spectator
of the national upheaving. Misled
by her own enthusiasm for the laws
and constitution of England, and
still more by the ephemeral homage
paid to Necker, who had made his
cause triumphant in the king's cabinet,
Mme. de Staël honestly believed
that the dawn of true political liberty
was at hand; but this short-lived
chimera was changed to horror when
she realized the true motives, the
aim and object, of the demagogues.
The arrest of Louis XVI. and the
queen at Varennes filled her with
regret, the sincerity of which it is impossible
to doubt when we read her
account of this event in the <cite>Considérations
sur la Révolution Française</cite>.</p>

<p>Her knowledge of the men who
were the prime motors of these
momentous changes enabled her to
foresee the terrible catastrophe of the
10th of August. With great courage
and clear-sightedness, Mme. de Staël
drew up a plan of escape for the royal
captives. M. Bertrand de
Moleville, one of the king's ministers,
gives the details of this scheme, which
its author forwarded with a letter to
M. de Montmorin, one of his colleagues
in the ministry. Her idea was
to convey the royal family to the
coast of Normandy, whence they
were to sail for England. Whether
the plan was practicable or not, was
never tested; M. de Montmorin
knew too well that it was utterly useless
to place it before the king.</p>

<p>The murder of the king and queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
filled the heart of Mme. de Staël with
indignation and dismay. Such was
the effect that this crime had upon
her, that for a long time she was
quite broken-hearted, all her faculties
were absorbed and, as it were, paralyzed
by the deeds of blood that
were being perpetrated around her.
When at last she roused herself to
resume her pen, it was on behalf of
the unfortunate Marie-Antoinette;
she addressed to the monsters who
then ruled France an article entitled
"Défense de la Reine." We can
easily imagine what consummate skill
and prudence were necessary at
such a moment in dealing with the
tigers she was striving to disarm.
But not even at this crisis would
Mme. de Staël descend to flattery;
her talent and her spirit were alike
above such arts. While scorning to
propitiate them by insulting the
queen, or using any of those invectives
against royalty then in vogue,
she tried to merge the sovereign in
the woman, the mother, and the devoted
and courageous wife. Strong
and deep reverence, joined to a delicate
and ingenuous pity, breathe
throughout this noble appeal.</p>

<p>If Mme. de Staël had written
nothing else, this article alone would
have sufficed to ensure her fame.</p>

<p>Shortly after the fall of Robespierre,
she published two pamphlets,
one entitled <cite>Reflections on Peace at
Home</cite>, the other <cite>Reflections on Peace</cite>,
<em>addressed to Pitt and to the French</em>.
This latter work received a tribute of
praise from Fox in the House of
Commons.</p>

<p>Mme. de Staël took a deep interest
in the government formed under the
new constitution of 1795, but in her
desire to become acquainted with
the men who were likely to be chosen
members of it, she formed intimacies
with some who were unworthy of
her; even her literary reputation
suffered from these so-called friendships.
The public rarely discriminates
wisely between the character
of an author and that of his or her
surroundings.</p>

<p>Just at this time Mme. de Staël
became the centre of a circle of politicians,
who used to meet at the
Hôtel de Salm under the title of the
Constitutional Club: this society had
been formed to counterbalance the
doctrines of the Clichy Club, which
were ultra-revolutionary. Benjamin
Constant was one of the principal
speakers at the "Constitutional."</p>

<p>Thibaudeau, in his memoirs, lately
published, declares that Mme. de
Staël secretly favored the Directory,
and even attributes to her influence
the reappearance on the political
stage of one who had long forfeited
the position he formerly held there.
"M. de Talleyrand," says Thibaudeau,
"had just returned from the
United States without any money,
when, through the influence of a
woman famous for her wit and her
spirit of intrigue, he was introduced
into the intimacy of Barras."</p>

<p>But enthusiastic as this famous woman
was for glory and talent, she was
far too shrewd to be deceived by the
fine talk of the young conqueror, who
came with the spoils of Egypt in
his knapsack to dictate to France,
promising to replace the "ignoble
Directory by a splendid and solid
government." Her knowledge of
human nature enabled her to foresee
with certainty what the result would
be when the despot was raised to
power; it would be war to the knife
against liberty in every shape and
form, and against all its supporters.
One of Bonaparte's panegyrists has
attempted by a base and monstrous
calumny to exonerate his petty persecution
of a woman by attributing
to her a woman's vindictive spite as
the motive of her resistance to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>
and his policy. This worthy servant
of his master declares, on the word
of the latter, that Mme. de Staël was
in love with Bonaparte, and that his
coldness to the <i lang="fr">femme savante</i> was
the real motive of her opposition.
The story is as worthy of the husband
of the loving and divorced Josephine
as it is unworthy of Mme. de Staël.
Her real crime in his eyes was her
unyielding integrity of principle, and
the preternatural insight of her genius,
which made it impossible for him
to dupe her. He verified all her
previsions to the full. No sooner
had he seized the reins of power
than he used it to paralyze liberty in
every form; most, above all, when it
was handled by talent. Mme. de
Staël was imprudent enough to boast
of her prophetic instinct on this score
to Joseph Bonaparte, who was her
friend, but who was also the brother
of the First Consul. He entreated
her to be more guarded in her words,
and soon after warned her that the
conversations of her <i lang="fr">salon</i> found
their echo in the Tuileries. When
she laughed at his friendly information,
he tried to convince her by a
more powerful argument. Necker
had deposited two millions in the
royal treasury, and this sum should
be restored to his daughter if she
would so far condescend to recognize
the First Consul as to ask him for
it. Mme. de Staël replied that she
would never sue where she had a
right to exact, and instead of conciliating
the great man, she urged Benjamin
Constant to pronounce immediately
his famous speech denouncing
the covert tyranny of the First
Consul, which so roused the wrath
of the latter against him and her that
from this time forth Mme. de Staël
was to know no peace. The daring
act sealed her doom. Friends, terrified
at her boldness and its consequences,
deserted her <i lang="fr">salon</i>. Fouché,
the minister of police, summoned her
to his presence, and informed her in
his master's name what she already
knew, that no one might brave his
anger with impunity.</p>

<p>A few days after this official interview
she went to a <i lang="fr">fête</i> given by
Gen. Berthier, having accepted the
invitation in hopes that some violent
outburst from Bonaparte would give
her the opportunity of taking a woman's
vengeance, and sharpening her
wit on him. She actually tells us
that she rehearsed an imaginary scene
between them, and wrote down her
own answers, polishing them off till
they were sharp as steel. It was
time and wit wasted, however; Bonaparte
only accosted her with some
vulgar platitude that afforded no
opening for pert reprisals. Not
long after this disappointment she
met the enemy again, this time by
chance, and fortune served her better.
Mme. de Staël was discussing some
political question with great animation
when the First Consul came up
to the group of admiring listeners,
and said brusquely:</p>

<p>"Madame, I hate women who talk
politics."</p>

<p>"So do I, General," replied his adversary,
looking him coolly in the
face; "but in a country where men
persecute them and cut their heads
off, it is well to know why." On another
occasion, when he accosted her
in a gracious mood, she made bold to
ask him what woman in France he
was proudest of. "The woman who
has most children," was the coarse
rejoinder.</p>

<p>Mme. de Staël made frequent journeys
to Coppet, her father's residence.
This was another crime in the eyes
of the First Consul, as Necker was
supposed to have been helped by his
talented daughter in his work, <cite>Politics
and Finance</cite>&mdash;a book which Bonaparte
resented furiously as an attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
on his own policy and system of
finance.</p>

<p>On Mme. de Staël's return to Paris
after the appearance of the work, she
was warned that her personal liberty
was in danger. Regnault de Saint-Jean
d'Angély, who was her friend
though in Napoleon's service, got her
safe out of Paris, and secured her the
hospitality of a relative of his in the
country, where, she tells us, she used
often to sit at her window of a night
watching for the arrival of the <em>gendarmes</em>
to seize her. She soon left
this kindly shelter for the home of
her friend Mme. Récamier, at Saint
Brice. In the security of this quiet
retreat the fugitive fancied herself forgotten
by Napoleon, and decided to
settle down at a small country-house
about ten leagues from Paris. Scarcely
had she done so when the happy
illusion was dispelled. A commandant
of <em>gendarmerie</em> presented himself
at her door with an order signed
by the First Consul, bidding her withdraw
forty leagues from the capital
within twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Joseph Bonaparte and General Tunat
had interceded for her, but in
vain. Mme. de Staël, exasperated,
refused the privilege of remaining in
France on such conditions, and decided
to seek refuge in Germany,
where she could "confront the
courtesy of the ancient dynasty with
the impertinence of the new one that
was striving to crush France."</p>

<p>Her first resting-place was Weimar,
the German Athens of that day. Here
she learned German under such professors
as Goethe, Schiller, and Wieland.
In 1804, she visited Berlin,
where she met with the kindest reception
from the king and queen; but
her stay there was short; she was
summoned hence to her father's
death-bed, and arrived too late to
embrace him. This was a fearful
blow; she strove to assuage her
grief by collecting his MSS., with
a view to publishing them, but her
health, shaken by so many vicissitudes,
gave way, and she was obliged
to seek change and rest in Italy.
The sight of Rome and of Naples
awoke a new life within her, and
restored to her the power of writing,
which for a time she had lost.</p>

<p>But nothing could long console
her for her absence from her own
beloved country. The longing to see
France at last so far subdued her
proud spirit that she determined to
avail herself of the privilege of approaching
within forty leagues of
Paris; she returned accordingly, and
settled at Rouen. This was indeed a
violation of the permitted limits, but
Fouché shut his eyes to it, and the
exile remained undisturbed at the
residence of her friend M. de Castellane,
where she finished <cite>Corinne</cite>,
and corrected the proof-sheets. The
work appeared in 1807, and awoke
a very trumpet-blast of applause all
over Europe. But fame was a crime
in one who had incurred the tyrant's
displeasure, and the author received
a peremptory order to quit France.
Broken-hearted and despairing, she
returned to Coppet, where she was
accompanied by a few faithful friends,
who braved all to share her solitude.
Here she continued to occupy herself
with her great work, <cite>Germany</cite>.
Feeling, however, that a more perfect
knowledge of the country was necessary
before completing it, she resolved
to spend the winter of 1807 at
Vienna. She met with a flattering
reception there from the Prince de
Ligne, the Princesse Lubomirska,
and most of the distinguished personages
of the court, and returned in
the spring to Coppet.</p>

<p>As soon as her book on Germany
was ready for the press, Mme. de
Staël set out for France, and placed
herself at the distance prescribed&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>forty
leagues. She took up her abode
at the old castle of Chaumont, formerly
the residence of the Cardinal
d'Amboise, Diana of Poitiers, and
Catherine de' Medicis.</p>

<p>While passing a few days with her
dear and valiant friend, M. de Montmorency,
the persecuted author received
the terrible tidings that 10,000
copies of her new work just issued
had been seized by the minister, although
she had taken the precaution
of submitting the proofs for approval
to the censorship. This tyrannical
measure was followed by an order to
leave France within three days. She
begged for a short delay, hoping, by
means of a German passport, to land
in England; but to this request the
Duc de Rovigo sent a positive refusal.
Mme. de Staël revenged herself
later by placing the duke's letter
in her second edition of <cite>Germany</cite>.</p>

<p>From Fossé she fled to Coppet.
Here she found that the prefect of
Geneva had received orders to destroy
any proofs or copies of her work that he
could discover. At the same time, he
hinted to Mme. de Staël that she
might soften the tyrant by seizing the
opportunity to write an ode on the
new-born "King of Rome." "My
best wish for his infant majesty," she
replied, "is, that he may have a good
nurse." This impertinence came to
Napoleon's ears, and Mme. de Staël
expiated it by a prohibition to move
two leagues from Coppet. Her friends
were finally included in her disgrace.
M. Schlegel, her son's tutor, was ordered
to resign his position in her family,
and M. de Montmorency was exiled
for daring to give her the protection
of his presence in return for the courageous
hospitality he had received
from her during the Terror. Mme.
Récamier was similarly punished for
her boldness in befriending the woman
who defied Bonaparte. Hunted to
earth while she remained on French
soil, Mme. de Staël felt that nothing
remained to her but to seek peace
and security in flight. But whither
should she fly? Bonaparte's spies
were spread like a network over the
Continent. They would vie with each
other in setting traps for her. Russia
alone offered some chance of rest; so,
one bright spring morning, Mme. de
Staël went out for a drive, and, instead
of returning home, posted on through
Switzerland and the Tyrol to Vienna.
She quickly discovered that it was
not possible for her to tarry here;
the tyrant's tools were on her track.
"March! march!" was still the cry
of fate; and, like the Wandering Jew,
she sallied forth once more on her
wanderings. Moscow seemed like a
promised land where she might rest
awhile; but, scarcely had she drawn
breath amidst the unmelted snows of
the northern city, when the hunter
was down upon her. The <em>Grande
Armée</em> was advancing rapidly on the
Russian capital. "March! march!"
And again the fugitive was on the
road, flying to St. Petersburg. Here
at last came a respite. The emperor
and empress received her like a dethroned
sovereign; the nobility followed
suit, partly out of admiration
for the gifted exile, partly in hatred
to her foe, who was theirs also. She
was entertained at public banquets,
and became the lion of the hour. At
one of these magnificent <i lang="fr">fêtes</i> given in
her honor, the toast, "Success to the
Russian arms against France!" was
proposed. Mme. de Staël seized her
glass, and, with a sudden inspiration
of patriotism, cried out: "No, not
against France! against her oppressor!"
The amendment was adopted
with applause. But St. Petersburg was
no safe retreat for the baroness while
the French legions were at Moscow.
She was advised by friends to fly, and,
once more folding her tent, she carried
it to Stockholm. Here she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
allowed to recruit her wearied limbs
and more wearied spirit for some
months. She employed the interval
of quiet in writing the recollections
called <cite>Ten Years in Exile</cite>. On leaving
Sweden she set sail for England,
with a view to publishing her famous
<cite>Allemagne</cite>&mdash;the work which had been
the immediate cause of her recent
persecutions, having exasperated Bonaparte
beyond all powers of endurance.
It was not until the fall of her
enemy that Mme. de Staël ventured
to return to France. Her joy, however,
at this twofold event was of
short duration. The despot who knew
no mercy to the weak was not to be
bound by the chains of honor. He
broke his plighted word, fled from
Elba, and landed one morning on
the shores of France. It was the
signal for Mme. de Staël to fly from
them. Filled with patriotic grief and
personal dismay, she started immediately
for Coppet. She had barely
arrived there when a letter followed
her with the unexpected order to return
to Paris, "where the emperor
considered her presence would be
useful in establishing constitutional
ideas." But she, whom threats and
exile had not daunted, was not to be
beguiled by flattery. "Tell your
master," she replied to the writer of
the singular invitation,&mdash;"tell your
master that since he has got on for
twelve years without me or the constitution,
he can do without us a little
longer, and that at this moment he
hates one about as much as the
other."</p>

<p>What wonder if the health of this
intrepid woman gave way, in spite
of her indomitable spirit, under this
long spell of mental and physical
fatigue, and ceaseless vexation and
disappointment. Her declining years
were consumed in intense suffering,
borne with the utmost courage and
resignation. She returned finally to
France after the Restoration, and
was treated with every mark of esteem
by Louis XVIII. He delighted
in her conversation, and gave her
a more substantial proof of good-will
by restoring to her the two millions
that her father had deposited in the
treasury before his fall. This act of
justice bound her by ties of enduring
gratitude to the king and his dynasty.</p>

<p>But she was not spared long to enjoy
the honors that now surrounded
her. Sorrow, and the despondency
consequent on great bodily exhaustion,
had tempted Mme. de Staël into
the deadly habit of using opium, and
when once contracted she had not
strength to relinquish it, even after
the cause that made the stimulant
a necessity of existence to her had
disappeared. Her friends used every
argument and every stratagem to
cure her, but in vain. She fell into
a state of lethargy, or rather into a
succession of lethargic slumbers,
broken by sudden gleams of her old
brightness. Her patience was very
touching, and many evidences are
preserved to show that she drew it
from her unshaken faith in Christianity,
however imperfect the form in
which she had been reared, and to
which she was outwardly attached.
Once, on awaking from her slumbrous
state, she exclaimed to those who
surrounded her bed: "It seems to
me that I know now what the passage
from life to death is; and I feel
how God in his mercy softens it to
us." She expired on the 14th of July,
1817, the anniversary of the very day
on which her father's false theories
and blind self-confidence had put the
match to the powder and kindled
that terrific conflagration which enveloped
France in flames. Her remains
were deposited at Coppet, in
the tomb she had raised to the memory
of the great financier.</p>

<p>Those who were present at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
reading of her will, heard for the first
time of her marriage with M. de
Rocca. In that document she bade
her children proclaim the fact, as also
the birth of a boy by this union.
A relative and intimate friend of
Mme. de Staël's gives us an account
of her first meeting with her second
husband:</p>

<p>"A young man of good birth excited
much interest at Geneva by the
stories current about his bravery, and
by the contrast between his age and
his fragile appearance and shattered
health; the result of wounds received
in Spain, where he had served
in a French hussar regiment. A
few words of sympathy addressed to
him by Mme. de Staël produced a
most wonderful effect; his head and
heart took fire. 'I will love her so
well,' he vowed, 'that she will end
by marrying me!' and he was right.
Their affection for each other was of
the deepest and tenderest kind. She
lived in perpetual fear of losing him,
owing to his delicate health; and yet
it was he who survived her, but only
a year; he died at Hyères, more
from grief than from his infirmities,
in his thirty-first year."</p>

<p>We have said nothing of the person
of this singularly gifted woman.
"She was," to quote the words of a
contemporary, "graceful in all her
movements; her face, without being
handsome, attracted your attention,
and then fixed it; a sort of intellectual
beauty radiated from her countenance,
which seemed the reflex of
her soul. Genius was visible in her
eyes, which were of a rare splendor;
her glance had a fire and strength
that resembled the flash of the lightning,
and was the forerunner of the
thunder-roll of her language; her
large and well-proportioned figure
gave a kind of energy and weight to
her discourse. To this was added a
certain dramatic effect. Though free
from all exaggeration in her dress,
she studied what was picturesque
more than what was the fashion.
Her arms and hands were beautiful,
and singularly white."</p>

<p>This picture is an attractive one,
and paints Mme. de Staël in very
different colors from those generally
used by her portrayers. It is only
natural that a woman who had all
her life been before the world, should
be variously judged by various people.
A celebrated writer of her own day,
who knew the author of <cite>Corinne</cite>
both as an author and a woman,
said that she would not be impartially
judged until a century had gone
by. Napoleon raised her to a pedestal
of martyrdom by his unmanly
and cruel persecution, and the <i lang="fr">éclat</i>
of her genius hid her individual
faults and errors in a haze of glory.
She was hated by the flatterers who
fawned on the tyrant because she
dared to defy him. Some considered
her a cold, masculine woman, who
had none of the charm of womanhood
about her; while others, dazzled
by her talent, idealized her as a
sort of demigod. Distance enables
us to estimate her more justly. She
was a woman of unrivalled energy
of character, of incomparably brilliant
parts, and endowed with a
heart equal in tenderness to the
power of her genius. Her written
style gives but a faint idea of the lustre
of her conversation. She was,
perhaps, quite unparalleled in this
last sphere. The play of wit, logic,
and grace never flagged for an instant,
but kept her hearers spellbound
as long as her voice was
heard. Once, at a <em>soirée</em> at Mme.
Récamier's, she got into a discussion
with the Archbishop of Sens, as to
whether it was an advantage or a
misfortune for a nation to be in
debt; the archbishop took the latter
view of the question, and they kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
up the ball for two hours, until the
excitement among the guests became
so great that they stood upon
chairs in the adjoining <i lang="fr">salon</i> to enjoy
the brilliancy of the intellectual combat.
She was, as her death attests, a
devout believer in Christianity. On
one occasion, after listening to some
metaphysicians crossing lances over
their pet theories, she remarked:
"The Lord's prayer says more to
me than all that."</p>

<p>From the repetition of this divine
prayer during her long nights of
sleeplessness she drew patience and
resignation. By birth and education
a Protestant, she never allowed her
lofty mind to be prejudiced against
Catholics, and often spoke with enthusiasm
of the heroic courage of the
martyred priests and bishops of the
memorable 2d of September, 1792.
<cite>The Imitation of Christ</cite> was her constant
companion and solace during
her long illness. This woman of
genius was a devoted mother. Her
literary pursuits did not interfere
with her maternal duties: she superintended
the education of her children
herself, and often impressed upon
them that, "if they fell away from
the path of honor and duty it would
be not alone an irreparable sorrow,
but a remorse" to her, as she would
accuse herself of being the cause
of it.</p>

<p>She was not happy in her first
marriage, which was purely one of
"arrangement." There was no sympathy
of taste or ideas between her
and the Baron de Staël; her separation
from him was nevertheless a
deep source of pain to her, and she
never would have consented to it but
for the ruinous state into which his
imprudence and extravagance had
thrown her financial affairs, and
which must have led to the utter
ruin of his family if they had been
left longer in his hands. When his
increasing years and illness demanded
the consolation of her companionship,
she returned to her husband
with affectionate alacrity, and devoted
herself to him until his death.</p>

<p>The multiplicity of Mme. de Staël's
writings earned for her the <em>sobriquet</em>
of "the female Voltaire." She began
to write when most girls of her
age are still in pinafores; her early
works are like the flights of a young
eagle, betraying the fearless temerity
of conscious power, combined with
the inexperience of youth&mdash;she
plunges into depths, and soars to
heights of metaphysics and philosophy
with all the audacity of untaught
genius. <cite>The Influence of the Passions
on the Happiness of Nations and
Individuals</cite> is one of the most striking
of those juvenile feats, and was
quickly followed by others in the
same field. Her novels are undoubtedly
the first of her claims on
enduring fame. <cite>Delphine</cite> is supposed
to be Mme. de Staël as she was,
and <cite>Corinne</cite> as she wished to be.
They are both masterpieces of the romantic
school prevalent in that day,
and they both inaugurated a new
reign in fiction. The closing years
of the author's agitated life were
devoted to the compilation of the volumes
entitled <cite>Considerations on the
French Revolution</cite>&mdash;a work of great
magnitude, and which was intended
to embrace the full exposition and
justification of her father's policy
and life, and a philosophical analysis
of the theories of all known forms of
government, as well as an elaborate
history of the causes and effects of
the Revolutionary crisis. The plan
was colossal in scope, and almost infinite
in the variety of subjects it included;
but death did not wait for
her to finish it. Amongst her earliest
literary productions we must not
refuse a passing mention to her dramatic
efforts. She was not twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
when <cite>Sophie</cite> and <cite>Jane Grey</cite> earned
for her a place amongst the most
mature and brilliant writers of the
period. There is no doubt, if she had
had leisure to pursue this vein, Mme.
de Staël would have enriched the
French language with some remarkable
comedies and tragedies. Her
works were collected after her death
by the Baron de Staël, her son, and
form a series of eighteen large volumes.</p>

<p>The interest of the subject has led
us into a somewhat lengthy sketch
of the life of this distinguished lady.
French annals furnish a study, almost
unique, of women who were models
of all womanly virtues, and yet by
their brilliancy, wit, and conversance
with public affairs were fitted to be
the advisers of rulers and statesmen.
We are very far from wishing
to see the sex drawn out of their
proper sphere, but when by natural
and acquired talents they evince
a vocation for affairs of state, we
think that governments may wisely
accept their counsel, and that
their services are worthy of permanent
record.</p>

<h3>FATHER SEBASTIAN RALE, S.J.</h3>


<p>The rivalries of the French and
English for dominion in the northwestern
corner of our republic have
deeply impressed themselves upon the
pages of our history. The element
of religious controversy was not the
least of the exciting causes which
made that frontier the scene of angry
strife. The French carried the Catholic
faith wherever they erected the
arms of their kings, and the natives
flocked with ardor and conviction
around the standard of the cross.
Whatever may have been the merits
of the respective parties in the contest
for dominion, it is now the settled
voice of history that the Catholic
missionaries were actuated by motives
far above all earthly considerations,
and that their cause was that
of no earthly king, but was the sacred
cause of the King of Heaven.</p>

<p>Sebastian Rale was born of a good
family in Franche-Comté, in the year
1658. At an early age he entered
the Society of Jesus. After passing
through the novitiate, he was engaged
in teaching at the College of
Nismes. To fine natural abilities he
added great industry, and thus became
an accomplished scholar. A
foreign mission was the object of
his holy aspirations; and, after his ordination,
he received directions from
his superior to embark for Canada.
He sailed from Rochelle on the 23d
of July, 1689, and, after a voyage
without accidents, arrived at Quebec
on the 13th of October following.
As his destination was the mission
among the Abnakis, the Men-of-the-East,
he employed his time at Quebec
in studying their language.</p>

<p>It was not long, however, before
he was sent on the mission to St.
Francis, an Abnaki village, containing
about two hundred inhabitants, most
of whom were Catholics. Among
these, the gentlest of the Indian
tribes in the North, his first essays
at his favorite vocation were made
by this illustrious missionary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span></p>

<p>He had commenced the study of
the Abnaki dialect at Quebec; surrounded,
as he now was, by the Abnakis
themselves, he prosecuted that
study with great industry. While
acquiring their language, he was also
engaged in writing his Abnaki catechism
and dictionary. Every day he
spent some time in their wigwams, in
order to catch from the lips of the
Indians the idioms of their language;
and he often subjected himself to
their merry laugh by uttering some
sentence for the proposed catechism
in his broken Abnaki, which, as they
rendered in the pure idiom, the patient
student copied in his book.
After two years' labor at St. Francis,
he was selected by the superior to
succeed the missionary of the Illinois,
who had recently died, because
that mission required a father who
had already acquired some one of
the Algonquin dialects.</p>

<p>Before setting out for his Illinois
missions, he spent three months at
Quebec, studying the Algonquin language.
On the 13th of August, 1691,
he launched his little bark canoe, for
his long and arduous voyage to the
West. Slowly they moved onward;
he and his companions landed night
after night to build their fire and
erect their tent, which consisted
of their little canoe turned up, as
their only shelter from the storms.
After those long days of labor and
fasting, their slender meals were made
upon a vegetable, called by the
French <i lang="fr">tripe de roche</i>.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> His companions
were so exhausted on reaching
Michilimackinac that he was
obliged to stop and winter there.
Well may the historian remark of
these expeditions of the Catholic
missionaries to the West that "all
must feel that their fearless devotedness,
their severe labors, their meek
but heroic self-sacrifice, have thrown
a peculiar charm over the early history
of a region in which the restless
spirit of American enterprise is going
forth to such majestic results."<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>F. Rale wintered at Michilimackinac
with the two missionaries stationed
there, one of them having the care
of the Hurons, and the other of the
Ottawas. Here, with the aid of F.
Chaumonot's grammar, he learned
sufficient of the Huron tongue&mdash;the
key to most of those spoken in Canada&mdash;to
assist the Huron missionary.
Scarcely had the spring opened, when
F. Rale was urging his canoe along
the western coast of Lake Michigan.
He passed by the villages of the
Mascoutens, Sacs, Outagamis or
Winnebagoes, Foxes, and others, till
he came to the bottom of the lake.
Having reached the Illinois partly
by river and partly by portage, he
launched his canoe on that river, and
glided down its stream one hundred
and fifty miles, till he came to the
great town of the Illinois Indians.
This town contained about two thousand
five hundred families, and the
rest of the nation were scattered
through eleven other villages. F.
Rale was welcomed to their country
by the greatest of Illinois feasts,
"the Feast of the Chiefs," at which
the appetite was penanced by feeding
on dogs, which were esteemed the
greatest of delicacies among the
Indians, and of which a large number
had been served up on this occasion
in honor of their distinguished
guest. To every two persons an entire
dish was allotted. The father
manifests no great relish for the
food he received, but he expresses
the greatest admiration and astonishment
at the powerful eloquence and
wild beauty of the oration with which
he was regaled on this occasion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span></p>
<p>F. Rale devoted himself with zeal
to the care of his new flock. His
principal difficulty consisted in overcoming
in them the practice of polygamy.
"There would have been,"
he writes, "less difficulty in converting
the Illinois did the Prayer permit
polygamy among them. They acknowledged
that the Prayer was good,
and were delighted to have their
wives and children instructed; but
when we spoke on the subject to the
braves, we found how hard it was to
fix their natural fickleness, and induce
them to take but one wife, and her
for life." Again, the father writes:
"When the hour arrives for morning
and evening prayers, all repair to the
chapel. Not one, even the great
medicine-men&mdash;that is to say, our
worst enemies&mdash;but sends his children
to be instructed, and, if possible, baptized."
The good missionary had the
consolation of baptizing numbers of
sick infants before death carried them
off, and there were among the adults
many devout Christians, to whom the
faith was dearer than their lives.</p>

<p>After two years thus spent among
the Illinois, his superior recalled F.
Rale for other duties about the year
1695. During the return to Quebec,
he instructed fully in the faith, and
baptized, a young Indian girl, whose
edifying death afterwards this zealous
father esteemed an ample consolation
and recompense for all the trials and
hardships of his life. On arriving at
Quebec, he was assigned to the mission
in the heart of the Abnaki country,
which F. Bigot had re-established.</p>

<p>But this field, which F. Rale now
entered as a minister of the gospel of
peace, had become, during his absence,
the scene of war. While he had been
laboring on the distant banks of the
Illinois, the Abnakis had sustained
injuries from their English neighbors
which provoked them to take up the
hatchet in defence and retaliation.
Maj. Waldron, of Dover, had, in
1675, seized four hundred Indians of
their tribe, and sold them into slavery
in the West Indies. Though deeply
incensed at this revolting crime, the
Indians remained quiet till 1688,
when, upon a breach of the peace of
1678 on the part of the English, they
could no longer restrain their fury.
The war-cry was sounded through
the land, bands of infuriated and injured
braves rushed upon the English
frontier, Dover was taken, and Waldron
himself fell a captive into their
hands, and suffered a death most
shocking, it is true, but one which all
must admit he had deserved as many
times over, if that were possible, as
there had been victims of his rapacious
inhumanity. Pemaquid was
next taken, and destruction was visited
upon the entire line of frontier
settlements. The colonists now proposed
a peace, but the Indians had
already suffered too much from the
violation of treaties. They exclaimed:
"Nor we, nor our children, nor our
children's children will ever make a
peace or truce with a nation that kills
us in their halls."</p>

<p>But the Abnakis, unsupported in
the war by the French, were finally
constrained to accept the offer of
peace&mdash;a peace as deceptive as former
ones had proved.</p>

<p>The following year the great and
brave chief Taxus went to Pemaquid,
with some others, to propose an
exchange of prisoners: admitted into
the fort for this purpose, they were
treacherously fired upon, two of
them were killed, and Taxus killed
two of the garrison in cutting his
way through to make his escape.</p>

<p>This being the condition of the
country at the time that F. Rale was
sent there by his superior as missionary
to the Catholic Abnakis, it
may be easily judged how far that
state of things is justly attributable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
to what Mather calls "the charms
of the French friar." From what
has already been related, it is quite
certain that there existed sufficient
causes for war on the part of the
Indians without any influence from
F. Rale, had he been there to exert it.</p>

<p>So far from instigating or countenancing
acts of cruelty or blood on
the part of his flock, his office and
his labors were those of peace and
charity. His mission was to announce
the glad tidings of the Gospel:
"Glory to God on high, and
peace on earth to men of good-will."
And we have authority, not prejudiced
in favor of his cause, for the
assertion that he was not faithless to
his sacred duty. Thus Gov. Lincoln
says: "His followers were not only
the bravest, but <em>the most sparing</em>, of
the fierce race to which they belonged;
and though spoil and havoc were their
element, they could sometimes be
generous and forbearing. But when
the old man expired by the side of
the altar he had reared, the barbarism
he had only in a measure controlled,
broke loose with a ferocity not softened
by the dogmas he had taught."<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>The village of Narrantsouac, on
the Kennebec, still called Indian Old
Point, became the residence of F.
Rale. Here he found, on his arrival,
a little church and a flock of converted
Indians remarkable for their
devotion and sincerity. They entertained
a profound attachment to the
Prayer, and great veneration for him
who was its minister. Besides this,
they soon learned to love and esteem
F. Rale as their best friend; he
was their arbitrator in all disputes,
their physician in sickness, and their
consoler in all their distresses. Religion
was the reigning sentiment in
this truly Christian community, and
the little chapel, erected by the
hands of the neophytes, became at
once the object of their love and the
scene of their unalloyed devotion.</p>

<p>As game was scarce, the Abnakis
bestowed much care and labor in
the cultivation of their fields. After
planting the seed in the spring, they
sallied forth on fishing parties to the
sea-shore, accompanied by F. Rale.
In these expeditions, a rustic altar,
covered with an ornamental cloth,
was carried along, and the chapel-tent
was pitched every evening for
prayer, and struck in the morning
after Mass. On reaching the sea-shore
a large bark cabin was erected
for the church, and the wigwams of
the Indians were arranged around it.
Thus arose, as by the magic power
of religion, a beautiful village on the
distant sea-shore, with its chapel,
priest, and flock, and there were
heard the pious chant and fervent
prayer, there the mysteries of the
faith were taught to docile hearers,
there devout confessions heard, and
there the bread of life distributed.
The priest was truly the father of the
faithful. He was also their companion
and sympathetic friend. Hunger,
thirst, and fatigue he bore with
them, and their sorrows, as their joys,
were common. Yet in this rude and
simple mode of life the faithful Jesuit
conformed himself to the strictest
rules of his order. His hours
of rising and retiring, his Office, meditations,
and all his spiritual exercises
were as regular as those of his brethren
in the colleges of Europe. In
order to avoid interruptions while saying
his Office or performing his other
devotions, he would refrain from all
conversation, except in cases of necessity,
from evening prayers till after
Mass. His annual retreat was observed
at the beginning of Lent with
the same scrupulous exactness. The
pension which he was allowed by
the French government he distributed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
among the more needy of his spiritual
children.</p>

<p>In 1697, F. Rale heard, with solicitude
for his flock, that a strange
and unconverted tribe&mdash;the Amalingans&mdash;were
coming to settle near to
Narrantsouac. He feared for the
faith and morals of his neophytes
when exposed to the tricks of the medicine-men
and the seductive games
and dances of such superstitious
neighbors. He was engaged in the
confessional all the evening before
Corpus Christi and during the morning
of the festival till near noon.
In the meantime, deputies from the
newly arrived Amalingans came, bearing
presents, according to the Indian
custom, for the relatives of some
Abnakis recently destroyed by the
English. Towards noon the procession
of the blessed sacrament began
to move with a degree of magnificence
that astonished those natives
of the wilderness. Struck as were the
Amalingan deputies with the solemnity,
the earnestness, and the majesty of
the scene, they listened with conviction
to the fervent and eloquent words
of the father, who seized upon so
favorable an occasion to acquaint
them with the existence and attributes
of the Deity, whose worship
they then beheld. How sublime
and beautiful must have been the
appeal which the zealous missionary
made to those astonished warriors!
The deputies were convinced, but
they could not accept the prayer before
laying the words of the Black
Gown before the assembled sachems
of their tribe, who were expected to
arrive in the autumn. During the
summer, the father sent them a message,
reminding them of his words
and their promise. In due time the
answer was returned, that they desired
to embrace the Prayer, and
they invited the Black Gown chief
to come among them, and bring the
wampum of the faith. It happened
that Narrantsouac was then deserted
by its inhabitants, who were on one
of their excursions; and F. Rale set
out in his canoe for the village of
the Amalingans, who received him
with every honor, and welcomed him
with a salute of musketry. Soon a
cross was raised in the centre of the
village and a bark chapel was erected.
The missionary visited the
cabins and instructed the catechumens.
After Mass every day, three
public instructions were given; between
these they received private
instructions in their cabins. Four
chiefs and two matrons were first
baptized; then followed two bands
of twenty each, and finally the entire
tribe publicly received the Prayer
and were baptized. A public assembly
was then held, and the missionary
received the simple but touching
tokens of their gratitude and love,
and then he returned in his canoe to
Narrantsouac, while the Christian
Amalingans departed for the sea-shore.
F. Rale found no difficulty
afterwards in uniting in one nation
the two tribes that were now members
of the one fold of Christ.</p>

<p>In 1698, F. Rale, by the aid of
means and skilful labor sent from
Quebec, succeeded in erecting a neat
but simple chapel at his village of
Narrantsouac, or Norridgewock. In
this their new chapel the Abnaki
Christians assembled to unite with
the universal church in the solemn
rites of the Catholic worship. It
was there in their own native wilderness
that those Men-of-the-East were
contented to worship God in security
and peace. But, strange as it
may appear, the New England settlers,
themselves professing Christianity,
saw with jealousy and dislike a
Christian temple erected by the Abnakis
for Christian worship, while all
the heathen tribes of New England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span>
were left free and uncared for in
their horrid superstitions and brutal
sacrifices. This feeling on their part
appears the more extraordinary, since
at that time Acadia had been restored
to France by the treaty of Ryswick,
in 1697; that the Catholic faith
had been professed by the Abnakis
for half a century; and the Jesuit
missionaries had been their pastors
during all that period.</p>

<p>The interval of peace now enjoyed
seems not to have resulted in
strengthening the friendship nor in
conciliating the good-will and confidence
of the Indians. Fresh aggressions
were from time to time committed
upon them by their white neighbors.
But a blow was struck at their
chosen and beloved pastors which exhibits
the true sentiments entertained
on the one side and the grievances endured
on the other. On the 15th of
June, 1700, a law was passed, which recited:
"Whereas, divers Jesuit priests
and Popish missionaries, by their subtile
insinuations, industriously labor
to debauch, seduce, and withdraw
the Indians from their due obedience
unto his majesty, and to excite and
stir them up to sedition, rebellion,
and open hostility against his majesty's
government," and then proceeded
to enact, in reference to the same
priests and missionaries, that "they
shall depart from and out of the
same province on or before the 10th
day of September, 1700." In case any
one of them should be found in the
province after that time, it was provided
that he "shall be deemed and
accounted an incendiary and disturber
of the public peace and safety,
and an enemy to the Christian religion,
and shall be adjudged to suffer
perpetual imprisonment. And if
any person, being so sentenced and
actually imprisoned, shall break prison
and actually escape, and be afterwards
retaken, he shall be punished
with death."<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Gov. Bellamont, by
his influence, secured in New York
also the passage of a law "for hanging
every Popish priest that came
voluntarily into the province, which
was occasioned by the great number
of French Jesuits who were continually
practising upon our Indians."<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>Upon the accession of Gov. Dudley
to office, in 1692, he solicited a conference
with the Abnakis, and accordingly
a conference was held on
an island in Casco Bay. The object
of the governor was to secure the
neutrality of the Indians, in case the
French and English went to war.
Penhallow and such as follow him
contend that the governor succeeded
in his purpose, and secured a promise
from the Indians not to join their
allies, the French, in case of war.
But treaties had been imposed upon
those unlettered warriors which they
never understood, and, consequently,
never entered into. Besides, F.
Rale, who had the advantage over
Penhallow of having been present at
the conference, gives quite a different
statement of the affair. F. Rale, at
the request of the Indians, accompanied
them to the conference. "Thus,"
he relates himself, "I found myself
where neither I nor the governor
wished me to be." The governor
and the missionary exchanged the
usual civilities, and then the former,
stepping back among his people,
made his propositions to the Indians
in an address, which he concluded
with an offer to supply their wants,
take their furs, and supply them with
merchandise in return "at a moderate
price." An English minister accompanied
the governor, whose presence
could have had no other object
in view than a tender of his services
to the Abnakis in lieu of those of
F. Rale; but the latter supposes that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>his own presence disconcerted that
portion of the plan. When the Indians
retired to consult together,
Gov. Dudley approached F. Rale,
and said: "I beg you, sir, not to
induce your Indians to make war
upon us." "No, sir, my religion
and my sacred calling require me to
give them only counsels of peace,"
was the prompt and appropriate
reply. The Indians soon returned
and gave the following answer
through their orator: "Great chief,
you have told us not to unite with
the Frenchman if you declare war
against him. Know that the Frenchman
is my brother; we have but the
same Prayer, we dwell in the same
cabin&mdash;he at one fire, I at the other.
If I see you enter towards the fire
where my brother, the Frenchman,
is seated, I watch you from my mat
at the other. If I see a tomahawk
in your hand, I say, What will the
Englishman do with that hatchet?
and I would rise to see. If he raise
it to strike my brother, I grasp mine,
and rush upon him. Could I sit
still and see my brother struck?
No! no! I love my brother, the
Frenchman, too well not to defend
him. I therefore tell thee, great
chief, do no harm to my brother,
and I will do none to thee. Remain
quiet on thy mat; I will remain so
on mine." "Thus," says F. Rale,
"the conference ended."</p>

<p>Peace was soon interrupted. War
broke out between England and
France in 1703, and involved their
respective colonies on this continent
in the contest. The Abnakis of
Maine joined their French allies, and
both sides felt the ravages of war to
a fearful degree. The Indians, who
had long been impatient under the
encroaching policy of their white
neighbors, carried on the war with
destructive fury. Casco was taken,
the New England villages, forts, and
farms were pillaged, and six hundred
of the inhabitants led away captives.
As a minister of peace and mercy,
F. Rale endeavored to subdue the
wild passions of his injured and infuriated
Indians, as has been seen
above by the testimony of Gov.
Lincoln; but the people of New
England visited upon him all the
blame for the calamities which their
own wrong policy had occasioned.</p>

<p>Among the hostile movements of
the English during the war was an
expedition against Norridgewock, the
residence of F. Rale. In the winter
of 1705, "when the snow lay four
feet deep," and "the country looked
like a frozen field," Col. Hilton led
an expedition of two hundred and
seventy men against Norridgewock.
The village, all deserted as it was
by its inhabitants, was easily taken.
The intended victim, however, was
not there; for the missionary was
absent with the tribe, as it was his
habit to accompany them to the sea-shore.
But the cabins and the chapel
were there; the torch was applied,
and soon one blaze enveloped
the church and the village. When
the missionary returned, he shuddered
at the sacrilege he saw, and wept
over the calamities of his people. A
bark chapel soon rose from the ashes
of the church which had been destroyed,
and in it he dispensed the
consolations of religion to his flock
for several years.</p>

<p>During this year, F. Rale had the
misfortune to sustain a fall of such
violence as to break his right thigh
and left leg, and in this condition he
was compelled to make the painful
journey to Quebec for surgical aid.
The fractured parts were so imperfectly
cemented together that he had
to submit to the severe operation
of having his leg broken again and
reset. During his sufferings, not a
groan escaped him; and the surgeon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
who attended him has expressed his
wonder at such an exhibition of
Christian patience and love of suffering.
As soon as his wounds permitted
him to return, he was again
at his post in his little sanctuary in
the wilderness, where, amid personal
dangers the most appalling, he continued
calmly and without fear the
discharge of his sacred duties.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the English were
determined to get rid of him, and
the General Court of Massachusetts,
in November, 1720, passed a resolution
for that purpose. John Leighton,
Sheriff of York, was commissioned
to arrest him. If not found,
he was to demand him of the Indians;
upon their refusal, the Indians
themselves were to be taken and
carried to Boston. Every effort was
made to induce the Indians to betray
their pastor into the hands of
his enemies, or at least to send him
away from the country. They made
many attempts to seize him by force
or take him by surprise, and an offer
of £1,000 was made for his head.
Such was their horror of Jesuit sorcery!
"I should be too happy,"
says the object of their hatred, "were
I to become their victim, or did God
deem me worthy to be loaded with
chains, and shed my blood for the
salvation of my dear Indians." This
was said in no spirit of bravado or
vain display; for the sequel will show
how firmly, yet how meekly, he laid
down his life for his altar and his
flock.</p>

<p>In the midst of the wars that desolated
the country, it was his mild
spirit and humane counsels that served
to moderate the natural ferocity
of the Indian character. Instead of
urging the infliction of cruelty upon
those who had so long sought his
life, he endeavored to secure for his
enemies every mildness consistent
with the laws of war. "I exhorted
them," says F. Rale, "to maintain
the same interest in their religion as
if they were at home; to observe
carefully the laws of war; to practise
no cruelty; to kill no one except in
the heat of battle; and to treat the
prisoners humanely." His solicitude
for peace during the period of which
we have been speaking, at the very
moment that his enemies accused
him as an instigator of mischief, and
his kind sentiments towards them,
may be seen from the following letter
addressed to the authorities at Boston:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Narrantsoak</span>, Nov. 18, 1712.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: The Governor-General of Canada
advises me by a letter, which reached here
some days ago, that the last royal vessel,
arrived at Quebec Sept. 30, announces
that peace is not yet concluded between
the two crowns of France and England;
that, however, it was much talked of.
Such are his words.</p>

<p>Other letters, which I have received,
inform me that the Intendant, just come
out in that vessel, says that when on the
point of embarking at Rochelle, a letter
was received from M. de Tallard, assuring
them that peace was made, and would be
published in the latter part of October.</p>

<p>Now, this cannot be known in Canada,
but you may know it at Boston, where
vessels come at all seasons. If you
know anything, I beseech you to let me
know, that I may send instantly to Quebec,
over the ice, to inform the Governor-General,
so that he may prevent the Indians
from any act of hostility. I am,
sir, perfectly your very humble and obedient
servant,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Seb. Rale</span>, S.J.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>
</div>

<p>At length the tidings of the peace
of Utrecht, 30th March, 1713, arrived,
and restored quiet to New France
and New England. Gov. Dudley
called the Indians together in conference
at Portsmouth in July, 1713,
and announced to them that peace
had been made, and proposed to
them: "If you are willing, you and
we will live in peace." He then informed
them that the French had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
ceded Placentia and Port Royal to
the English. The Indians, through
their orator, replied that they had
taken up the hatchet because their
allies, the French, had taken it up,
and they were willing now to cast it
away, since the French had laid it
down, and to live in peace. Then
the orator added: "But you say that
the Frenchman has given you Placentia
and Port Royal, which is in
my neighborhood, with all the land
adjacent. He may give you what he
pleases. As for me, I have my land,
which the Great Spirit has given me
to live upon. While there shall be
one child of my nation upon it, he
will fight to keep it." Penhallow
gives a somewhat different account
of this conference; but that of F.
Rale is more in keeping with the
previous history of the Indians, and
more consonant with their character.
If they acknowledged themselves
subjects of Great Britain, they knew
no better in this than in previous
similar instances what they were
doing, for they understood not the
language attributed to them.</p>

<p>It may be judged how welcome
peace must have been to F. Rale
from the alacrity with which he availed
himself of it to attend to the religious
interests of his people. To rebuild
his church was the first object
of his solicitude. As Boston was so
much nearer than Quebec, the chiefs
sent deputies to the former place, in
order to procure workmen for rebuilding
the church, for whose services
they offered to pay liberally. The
governor gave them a most friendly
reception, and, to their astonishment,
offered to rebuild their church at his
own expense, "since the French governor
had abandoned them." Their
astonishment, however, was soon
changed into indignation when they
heard the condition annexed to this
apparently generous offer, which was
that they should dismiss their own
pastor, and receive in his place an
English minister. "When you first
came here," replied the indignant
deputies by their orator, "you saw
me a long time before the French
governors, but neither your predecessors
nor your ministers ever spoke to
me of Prayer or of the Great Spirit.
They saw my furs, my beaver and
moose skins, and of these alone they
thought; these alone they sought,
and so eagerly that I have not been
able to supply them enough. When
I had much, they were my friends;
but only then. One day my canoe
missed the route; I lost my way, and
wandered a long time at random,
until at last I landed near Quebec, in
a great village of the Algonquins,<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
where the Black Gowns were teaching.
Scarcely had I arrived, when
one of them came to see me. I was
loaded with furs, but the Black Gown
of France disdained to look at them.
He spoke to me of the Great Spirit,
of heaven, of hell, of the Prayer, which
is the only way to reach heaven. I
heard him with joy, and was so
pleased with his words that I remained
in the village to hear him.
At last the Prayer pleased me, and I
asked to be instructed. I solicited
baptism, and received it. Then I
returned to the lodges of my tribe,
and related all that had happened.
All envied my happiness, and wished
to partake of it. They, too, went to
the Black Gown to be baptized. Thus
have the French acted. Had you
spoken to me of the Prayer as soon
as we met, I should now be so unhappy
as to pray like you; for I could
not have told whether your Prayer
was good or bad. Now I hold to
the Prayer of the French; I agree to
it; I shall be faithful to it, even until
the earth is burnt and destroyed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>Keep your men, your gold, and your
minister. I will go to my French
father."</p>

<p>The required aid was obtained
from the French governor; workmen
were sent from Quebec, and the
church was built soon after the peace.
"It possesses a beauty," says the
missionary, "which would cause it to
be admired even in Europe, and
nothing has been spared to adorn it."
Subsequently two little chapels were
erected, about three hundred paces
from the chapel, by workmen obtained
probably from Boston; and these
chapels are probably what Hutchinson
in 1724 alludes to as having
been "built a few years before by carpenters
from New England." One
of them was dedicated to the Blessed
Virgin, the other to their guardian
angel. There, in his new church and
chapels, with the aid of rich vestments
and sacred vessels given by
some of his friends, and with the
seraphic music of forty innocent Indian
boys, all dressed in cassocks
and surplices, F. Rale conducted the
solemn offices of the church in the
wilderness with a splendor and beauty
not unworthy of more favored
lands. The processions on Corpus
Christi were quite unique and beautiful.
On these occasions the church
and chapels were ornamented with
the trinkets and fine work of the
squaws, and burning tapers made by
the Indians from the wax berries
growing on their own native shores,
and were thronged with ardent and
sincere worshippers&mdash;the simple children
of the forest gathering around
the Holy of Holies, and presenting
a scene in which angels themselves
might love to mingle.</p>

<p>The following account of F. Rale's
daily life cannot but prove interesting:
"He rose at four, and, after
meditation, said Mass at daybreak,
which all the Indians heard, and
during it chanted their prayers aloud;
at its close he generally, on week-days,
made a short exhortation, to
inspire them with good thoughts,
then dismissing them to the labors
of the day. He then began to catechise
the children and the young; the
aged, too, were there, all answering
with the docility of children. Then,
after a slight meal, he sat in his chamber
to despatch the various matters
laid before him&mdash;their plans, their
troubles, domestic disquiets, or intended
marriages&mdash;in a word, to direct
them all. Towards noon he would
go to work in his garden, and then
split his wood to cook his little mess
of hominy; for this may be said to
have been his only food. Wine he
never tasted, even when among the
French.</p>

<p>"After this frugal repast, he visited
the sick, and went to particular
cabins to give instruction where it
was more needed; and if a public
council or feast was to take place, he
must be present; for they never proceeded
to the one without first hearing
his advice, nor to the other without
his blessing on the food, which
was ready to be placed on the bark
plates, which each one brought, and
with which he immediately retired to
his cabin.</p>

<p>"The evening was left him to say
his Breviary and give some time to
prayer and reading; but this was so
often intrenched upon that at last he
made it a rule never to speak from
before evening prayer till after Mass
on the following day, unless he was
called to a sick-bed."<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>In the course of a few years, the
free spirit of the Indians began to
grow impatient under the encroachments
of the whites. Not only their
hunting-grounds, but even their fields
for cultivation, were circumscribed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
A conference with Gov. Shute was
held at Georgetown in August, 1717,
but it was evident that redress for the
Indians formed no part of the governor's
designs. He refused to treat
with them otherwise than as subjects;
he would not acknowledge their natural
liberty nor their hereditary title
to their hunting-grounds; nor would
he fix a boundary beyond which
the encroachments of the white men
should not extend. They were told,
however, that the English wished
them to become of one religion with
themselves; an English Bible was
given to them, and the governor told
them that the Rev. Mr. Baxter, who
accompanied him, would become
their teacher and pastor. Thus it
seems that the governor with one
hand presented them a Bible, and
with the other grasped their lands.
When a letter from F. Rale, pleading
in behalf of his children, was handed
to the governor, he treated it with
great contempt. "He let them
know," says Hutchinson, "that he
highly resented the insolence of the
Jesuit."<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Another mock treaty was
now entered into by the aid of interpreters.
F. Rale always protested
against it as fraudulent, and announced
to the New Englanders that
the Norridgewocks did not recognize
it. He never ceased his paternal
efforts in behalf of his Indians, and
repeatedly addressed letters to the
governor and other leading men of
New England, demanding justice for
them.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>Having tried every means of gaining
over the Indians to their cause
in vain, the New Englanders next
attacked them in the point which
seemed to attach them more than
any other to the French; this was
their religion. The Rev. Mr. Baxter,
a minister of ability and education,
as well as of an ardent zeal
against Popery, undertook to evangelize
the Abnakis. "Thus," says
Bancroft, "Calvin and Loyola met
in the woods of Maine." The
Protestant minister established at
Georgetown a school, which was
supported by the government, and,
by means of every attraction and inducement
which he could present to
them, endeavored first to gain the
children. But their hearts had already
been too deeply impressed
with religion by the Catholic missionaries
to receive the Prayer from
any person other than the Black
Gown. He then endeavored, but
with the same result, to gain his point
by addresses and harangues to the
parents, the chiefs, and braves of the
tribe. "He next assailed the religion
of the Indians. He put various
questions concerning their faith,
and, as they answered, he turned
into ridicule the sacraments, purgatory,
the invocation of saints, beads,
Masses, images, and the other parts
of the Catholic creed and ritual."<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>F. Rale saw at once that he must
meet the danger thus threatened to
the faith of his flock. He addressed
a respectful letter to Mr. Baxter,
covering an essay of one hundred
pages, in which he undertook to defend
and prove, "by Scripture, by
tradition, and by theological arguments,"
those tenets and practices
of the Catholic Church which the
minister had endeavored to ridicule.
In the letter enclosing the essay he
remarked that the Indians knew how
to believe, but not how to dispute, and
the missionary felt it to be his duty
to take up the controversy in behalf
of his neophytes. Mr. Baxter's reply
treated F. Rale's arguments as puerile
and ridiculous. Finding, however,
that his mission was a fruitless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>
one, Mr. Baxter returned to Boston.
The correspondence did not cease
here; but, after Mr. Baxter's return
to Boston, the letters turned upon
the purity of their Latinity, rather
than the theology of the respective
controversialists. F. Rale remained
at his post, the faithful guardian of
his flock.</p>

<p>The grievances of which the Indians
had been long complaining still
remained unredressed. In 1719 another
conference was held, but with
no better result than the previous
one at Georgetown. Fresh causes
of resentment were added. Some
Indians entered an English house to
trade, when suddenly they found
themselves surrounded by a force
ten times stronger than their own.
When about to cut their way
through, their arms were arrested by
a request on the part of the English
for a parley, and they were told that
the English only wished to invite
some of their number to visit the
governor at Boston. Four chiefs
consented to go, and, when they
arrived, they were detained as hostages,
to secure the payment of a
large ransom demanded by the
English for damages sustained by
them from depredations committed
by the tribe. The prisoners appealed
to their countrymen for relief,
and the ransom was accordingly
paid; but even then the English refused
to release them. A conference
was invited by the governor,
but this was done merely to prevent
an immediate rupture. At the designated
time, July, 1721, the chiefs, accompanied
by F. Rale; La Chasse,
the superior of the missions; Croisel,
and the young Castine, repaired to
Georgetown, but the governor did
not meet them there. La Chasse
then drew up a letter in Indian,
French, and English, setting forth the
claims of the Indians, and sent it to
Gov. Shute. No notice was ever
taken of it.</p>

<p>In December, 1721, the English
seized the young Castine, son of the
Baron de Castine by an Indian wife,
and a great favorite with the Abnakis.
"The ungenerous and unjust
arrest of this young man," says Dr.
Francis, "incensed to the highest
degree the countrymen of his mother,
among whom he had always lived."</p>

<p>Still, the Indians refrained from retaliation.
Another act of aggression
soon followed; a detachment of two
hundred and thirty men, towards the
end of 1721, or early in 1722, were
sent to seize the Catholic missionary.
As this party entered the Kennebec,
two young braves, hunting near the
shore, saw them, and, after following
them for some distance unobserved,
struck into the woods and gave the
alarm at Norridgewock, which was
then nearly deserted. Scarcely had
F. Rale time to consume the consecrated
host on the altar to save it
from sacrilege, and secure the sacred
vessels. He fled precipitately to
the woods, impeded as he was by
the painful condition of the wounds
received in the severe fall he had
received as related above. The
English arrived in the evening, and,
having waited till morning, pursued
him to the woods. They carefully
scoured every place, and at one time
came within eight steps of their intended
victim, and yet passed away
without seeing him, though only half
concealed behind a small tree. The
pursuers then returned disappointed
to Norridgewock, where they pillaged
the house of God and the missionary's
residence, and then retired, carrying
away with them everything belonging
to F. Rale&mdash;his desk, papers, inkstand,
and the Abnaki <cite>Dictionary</cite>,
which he had commenced at St.
Francis in 1691. He suffered the
extremes of hunger while thus in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span>
the woods, flying from the pursuit of
his enemies; yet his courage and resolution
remained firm and cheerful.
So great were the dangers that threatened
him at every moment that
his affectionate neophytes, and even
his superior, advised him to retire for
the present to Quebec. He always
answered: "God has committed this
flock to my care, and I will share its
lot, being too happy, if permitted, to
sacrifice my life for it." In a letter
to his nephew he asks: "What will
become of the flock, if it be deprived
of its shepherd? I do not in the least
fear the threats of those who hate me
without cause. 'I count not my life
dear unto myself, so that I may finish
my course with joy,' and the ministry
I have received of the Lord Jesus."</p>

<p>While thus the object of deadly
pursuit on the part of the English
colonists, F. Rale enjoyed the purest
consolation in the love and affection
of his devoted flock. On one occasion,
while he was accompanying
them on a hunting party, they suddenly
perceived that he was missing,
and the report was started that the
English had broken into his cabin
and carried him off. Their grief was
only equalled by their fury, and at
once the braves began to prepare for
an effort to rescue their pastor at the
hazard of their lives. Two of their
number, however, afterwards went to
his cabin, and there they found him,
writing the life of a saint in their own
language. Transported with joy,
they exclaimed: "We were told that
the English had carried you off, and
our warriors were going to attack
the fort, where we thought they had
doubtlessly imprisoned you!" "You
see, my children," replied the father,
"that your fears were unfounded; but
your affectionate care of me fills my
heart with joy; it shows you love the
Prayer." But as some of the warriors
were starting, he added: "Set out,
immediately after Mass, to overtake
the others, and undeceive them."</p>

<p>On another occasion he was with
them at a great distance from home,
when the alarm was given that the
English were within a few hours'
march of the encampment. All insisted
on his flying back to the village.
At daybreak he started with
two Indians as his escort. The journey
was long, the provisions were
out, and the father had for his only
food a species of wood, which he
softened by boiling. In crossing a
lake, which had begun to thaw, he
narrowly escaped being drowned
himself in his effort to assist another.
Saved from this danger, he was not
the less exposed to death from cold.
On the following day they crossed
the river on broken pieces of ice,
and were soon at the village. He
was welcomed back by a sumptuous
feast, consisting of corn and bear's
meat; and when he expressed his astonishment
and thanks for such a
banquet, the Indians replied: "What,
father! you have been fasting for
two days; can we do less? Oh!
would to God we could always regale
you so!" But while he was
thus feasting, his children elsewhere
were mourning over his supposed
death. His deserted cabin on the
shore led some, who knew nothing
of his flight, to believe that he had
been killed. One of these erected a
stake on the banks of a river, and to
it attached a piece of paper-birch
bark, on which he had drawn with
charcoal a picture of some English
surrounding F. Rale, and one was
represented cutting off the Black
Gown's head. When the main
body of the Indians came that way,
and saw the pictorial writing, its
meaning sank deep into their hearts,
and they were overwhelmed with
grief. They tore out the long scalp-locks
from their heads, and then sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>
on the ground around the stake,
where they remained motionless and
without uttering a word till the next
day. Such was their mode of manifesting
the most intense grief. But
what must have been their joy, when,
on returning to the village, they saw
their beloved father reciting his Office
on the banks of the river!</p>

<p>It would appear, from a letter in
the <cite>Massachusetts Historical Collections</cite>,
attributed to F. Rale, that he
accompanied the expedition that destroyed
Berwick. It is quite evident,
from what has been related of the
determination of the English to destroy
him, and of the repeated efforts
they made to accomplish that deadly
purpose, that F. Rale would not
have been safe at Norridgewock or
anywhere apart from the main body
of his people. It is not likely that
his devoted children, who saw his
danger, and were solicitous for his
safety, would permit him to remain
behind, exposed to the constant attempts
of his enemies upon his life.
His presence in the expedition
against Berwick was enough, with
his enemies, to confirm their charge
that he led them on to war against
the English. The truth is, their
own pursuit of him rendered his
presence there justifiable, as necessary
for his own safety, if it were
not justifiable on the ground that he
was their chaplain in war as in peace,
and that his presence among them
was more necessary for the religious
consolation of the dying, as well as
for moderating, by the counsels we
have already seen him giving them,
the usual cruelties of war. It does
not become his accusers, however, to
dwell upon this charge, who themselves
have boasted of the warlike
feats of the Rev. Mr. Fry, who scalped
and killed his Indian in Lovell's
expedition, and was killed fighting in
the thickest of the engagement.</p>

<p>It has already been seen how the
Indians were, by repeated injuries,
driven at last to take up the hatchet.
When once at war, they prosecuted
it with terrible energy and destructive
fury. And though their humanity
on several occasions contrasted
with the cruelty of their civilized antagonists,
the young settlements of
New England suffered much at their
hands during this contest.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1724, hostilities
on the part of the Indians had begun
to moderate, and peace was already
spoken of between the respective
parties. But this did not restrain
the fury of the English. On
the 23d of August an expedition of
little over two hundred, consisting
of English and their Mohawk allies,
rushed suddenly from the thickets
upon the unconscious village of Norridgewock.
The first notice the Indians
received was the rattling of
the volleys of their assailants among
their bark cabins. Consternation
seized upon the inhabitants; the
women and children fled, but the
few braves who were then at the
village rushed to arms to defend
their altar and their homes. The
struggle was indeed a desperate one.
F. Rale, when he perceived the cause
of the excitement in the village,
knew that himself was the chief object
of the enemy's pursuit. Hoping,
too, to draw off the fury of the
assailants from his neophytes upon
himself, he went forth. No sooner
had he reached the Mission Cross,
where the fight was raging, than a
shout of exultation arose from two
hundred hostile voices, and, though
a non-combatant, a discharge of
musketry was immediately levelled
at his venerable form. Pierced with
balls, he fell lifeless at the foot of the
cross. Seven principal chiefs lay
dead around their saintly pastor and
devoted father. The battle was now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
over, but the victory seemed too
easy for the victors; they approached
to wreak further vengeance upon
the lifeless form of F. Rale. They
hacked and mutilated the corpse,
split open the head, broke the legs,
and otherwise brutally disfigured it.
Then proceeding to the house of
God, the assailants rifled the altar,
desecrated the sacred vessels and the
adorable Host, and then committed
the church to the devouring flames.
After the English had retired, some
of the orphaned flock of Norridgewock
returned to their desolated
home; they first sought for the body
of their good father, and, having
found it, they piously interred it beneath
the spot where the altar stood.</p>

<p>After reading the incidents of the
life of F. Rale, the reader would be
astonished to peruse the accounts
given by New England writers. But
the latter bear on their face the evidence
that they were the result, not
of candid investigation, but of the
bitterest partisan prejudice. There
may be some explanation of their
tone, though no voucher for their
accuracy, in the fact that Penhallow
derived his accounts from interpreters,
who were known not to be faithful.
Charlevoix and De la Chasse knew
F. Rale personally, and they give us
the strongest assurances of his innocence,
his sanctity, and his many
heroic virtues. M. de Bellemont,
Superior of the Sulpician Seminary at
Montreal, entertained so exalted an
opinion of his merits that he did not
hesitate to apply to him the words
of S. Augustine: "Injuriam facit
martyri, qui orat pro eo."</p>

<p>The accounts hostile to F. Rale
have been derived chiefly from Penhallow,
who was actuated by the
strongest party feeling. A single
specimen from his pen will show how
he felt towards the person, as well as
the religion, of F. Rale; it contains
a repetition of the old calumny about
the merit of destroying heretics,
which no educated person would in
our day repeat: "We scalped
twenty-six besides M. Rale, the Jesuit,
a most bloody incendiary, and instrumental
to most of the mischiefs done
us by preaching up the doctrine of
meriting salvation by the destruction
of heretics. He even made the offices
of devotion serve as incentives
to their ferocity, and kept a flag on
which was depicted a cross surrounded
by bows and arrows, which he
used to hoist on a pole at the door
of his church when he gave them
absolution previous to their engaging
in any warlike enterprise." Now,
the flag that awakened so much horror
in the breast of the New England
chronicler was a simple Indian Sunday-school
banner, than which nothing
could have been more innocent.
F. Rale, artist as well as priest, had
decorated his Indian church with
pious paintings executed by himself,
to excite the piety and zeal of his
neophytes. Amongst other similar
representations, suitable for pleasing
the simple tastes of the natives, was
the flag in question, ornamented
with the cross and the arrow, emblems
of the faith and of the country.
A glance would have convinced
any passer-by that it was the banner
of an Indian church, and no sensible
person in our day could object to see
such an one used by the Indians of
Florida, Oregon, or other hostile
Indian country within our territory
or bordering on our frontier.</p>

<p>Dr. Francis, who in his life of Rale
follows by preference the New England
accounts, sums up his estimate
of our missionary's character as follows:
"But whatever abatements
from indiscriminate praise his faults
or frailties may require, I cannot
review his history without receiving a
deep impression that he was a pious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
devoted, and extraordinary man.
Here was a scholar, nurtured amid
European learning, and accustomed
to the refinements of one of the most
intellectual nations of the Old World,
who banished himself from the
pleasures of home and from the attractions
of his native land, and passed
thirty-five years of his life in the
forests of an unbroken wilderness, on
a distant shore, amidst the squalid
rudeness of savage life, and with no
companions during those long years
but the wild men of the woods.
With them he lived as a friend, as a
benefactor, as a brother; sharing
their coarse fare, their disgusting
modes of life, their perils, their exposures
under the stern inclemency
of a hard climate; always holding
his life cheap in the toil of duty, and
at last yielding himself a victim to
dangers which he disdained to escape.
And all this that he might
gather these rude men, as he believed,
into the fold of the church; that
he might bring them to what he
sincerely held to be the truth of God
and the light of heaven."</p>

<p>Mr. Bancroft thus describes the
life and character of the subject of
this memoir: "At Norridgewock, on
the banks of the Kennebec, the venerable
Sebastian Rale, for more than
a quarter of a century the companion
and instructor of savages, had gathered
a flourishing village round a
church, which, rising in the desert,
made some pretensions to magnificence.
Severely ascetic&mdash;using no
wine, and little food except pounded
maize, a rigorous observer of the
days of Lent&mdash;he built his own
cabin, tilled his own garden, drew
for himself wood and water, prepared
his own hominy, and, distributing
all that he received, gave an example
of religious poverty. And yet
he was laborious in garnishing up
his forest sanctuary, believing the
faith of the savage must be quickened
by striking appeals to the senses.
Himself a painter, he adorned the
humble walls of his church with pictures.
There he gave instruction
almost daily. Following his pupils
to their wigwams, he tempered the
spirit of devotion with familiar conversation
and innocent gaiety, winning
the mastery over their souls by
his powers of persuasion. He had
trained a little band of forty young
savages, arrayed in cassock and surplice,
to assist in the service and
chant the hymns of the church; and
their public processions attracted a
great concourse of red men. Two
chapels were built near the village,
one dedicated to the Virgin and
adorned with her statue in relief,
another to the guardian angel; and
before them the hunter muttered his
prayer on his way to the river or the
woods. When the tribe descended
to the seaside in the season of
wild fowl, they were followed by
Rale; and on some islet a little chapel
of bark was quickly consecrated."</p>

<p>The scene so peaceful, so happy,
so beautiful, in the days of F.
Rale, that it has been appropriately
called one of "nature's sweet retirements,"
is described by the poet
Whittier after the rude hand of war
had blasted its beauty and destroyed
its altar and its priest, as it appeared
to some Indian warriors who revisited
the field after the battle, in the
following lines:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No wigwam smoke is curling there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The very earth is scorched and bare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they pause and listen to catch a sound<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of breathing life, but there comes not one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save the fox's bark and the rabbit's bound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here and there on the blackened ground<br /></span>
<span class="i2">White bones are glistening in the sun.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the holy hymn at daylight's close,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the aged priest stood up to bless<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The children of the wilderness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is naught but ashes sodden and dank,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the birchen boats of the Norridgewock,<br /></span>

<h3>THE YEAR OF OUR LORD 1873.</h3>


<p>Will a new year ever dawn? is the
question that must present itself in some
shape or form to the one who glances at
the records of the years as they go by.
Eighteen hundred and seventy-three of
them have passed since that song was
heard at midnight on the mountains of
Judea, "Glory in the highest, and on
earth peace"; yet to-day the chant is as
new and strange as it then was. There
is no pagan Rome, but there is a Christian
Germany; the dead ashes of the divine
Emperor Tiberius were long ago
blown about the world, but the divine
Emperor William lives; there is no
Herod, but there is an Emanuel, whose
name is as characteristic of the man as
the word <em>Eumenides</em> of what it was intended
to represent. Who shall say that
there are no Pilates still, who would fain
wash their minds of conviction and their
hands of the blood of Christ with a little
water? Are none living who cast lots
for his seamless garment? Every person,
everything existing at the birth and
death of Christ, has its living counterpart
to-day; which is to say that human nature
is still human nature; that the last
chapter of the world's history has not yet
been written; and that, beautiful and sublime
as parts of it may be, "the trail of
the serpent is over it all."</p>

<p>The year now closing is bigger with
portent than event, as far, at least, as
events touch humanity at large. A
glance at the principal states of the
world, east as well as west, though
with a drowsier movement in the Orient,
will bring before the eye many of the
same symptoms throughout; more or less
of transition, of rapid and often violent
national change, which naturally shows
itself among peoples of a thousand creeds
in the relation of the governed to the
governing, of the individual to the state.
On this subject there are two extremes&mdash;personal
absolutism, on the one hand, and
communism, on the other. Both are
equally disastrous to humanity, both
are opposed to the law of Christ; hence
the believer in the law of Christ, the individual
who founds and builds his life
and that of his family on the law of
Christ&mdash;the Christian, the Catholic&mdash;is
equally objectionable to both, and alike
an object of hatred to Prussian imperialism
and French liberalism. We are
living in dangerous times; the world
seems at the crisis of a fever. God in
his mercy grant that it pass safely, and
that the patient awake from the long
delirium to its senses and the road to
recovery, however slow and toilsome!</p>

<p>In American history the year of our
Lord 1873 will probably be known as,
thus far at least, pre-eminently the year of
scandals. Early in this year, the Congress
of the United States, as if in emulation
of the example set by some of our
state legislatures and municipal corporations,
did, in the now famous Crédit Mobilier
transaction, furnish a chapter apart
in the annals of political malfeasance and
corruption. It shocked and shook the
confidence of the nation. The out-going
Vice-President escaped impeachment by
a vote so narrow as to imply a conviction
of his guilt; his successor entered with
the shadow of the same offence on his
character. The rank-and-file were worthy
of their leaders. Men stared blankly
in each other's faces, and asked whether
such a thing as honor existed in political
life. The result showed itself in general
apathy at the elections, while the tide,
such as it was, turned again to the opposite
party.</p>

<p>Corruption, fraud, embezzlement&mdash;embezzlement,
corruption, fraud! Such are
the chief headlines which the future
historian will find in the national annals
during this year of grace. The same
story is as true of private individuals as
of our public and representative men.
The fashionable crimes of the year&mdash;always
after murder and suicide, of
course&mdash;have been embezzlement and defalcation
on the part of gentlemanly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>
well-educated bank and insurance officers.
A batch of American citizens gave us a
world-wide celebrity by their long trial,
ending in conviction and severe punishment,
for astounding forgeries on the
Bank of England; so that it is doubtful,
as matters stand, which epithet would
convey the severest imputation on character&mdash;"As
honest as a cashier," or
"As honest as a member of Congress."</p>

<p>The early spring was signalized by, perhaps,
one of the last efforts of the Indians
against the whites. A small band of
Modocs, under the leadership of their
chieftain, "Captain Jack," who seemed
to have had serious causes of complaint,
after considerable negotiation, resolved to
die in harness rather than wait for what,
to them, was a lingering death on a narrow
reservation. They commenced operations
by treacherously murdering Gen.
Canby, a brave officer, and a peace commissioner,
during a peace parley. Retiring
to their caves, which afforded
them an admirable shelter, they for a
long time maintained a successful resistance
to the United States forces despatched
to destroy them, inflicting severe
loss on the troops. So successful was
Captain Jack's battle that at one time it
was feared the other tribes would rise
and join him. Run to earth at last, he
surrendered with one or two companions
who remained faithful. After due trial,
they were taken and hanged. A poor
issue for a Christian government!</p>

<p>Troubles loomed in Louisiana. Faction
contended with faction for the government
at a sacrifice of many lives.
When blood once flows in civil strife, it
is hard to tell where or when it will stop.
As civil war threatened, and as Congress
was not sitting, President Grant was
compelled to resort to the expedient of
ordering in the United States troops, not
only to preserve the peace, but to sustain
one of the parties in power. The country
looked with a natural jealousy on
this, at the time, apparently necessary
movement; for if all civil quarrels are to
be decided by federal bayonets, centralization
and consequent personal government
must sooner or later ensue. At
the same time, it is impossible to allow
local contests to be fought out <i lang="la">vi et armis</i>.
If the states cannot conduct their internal
affairs in a civil fashion and in the spirit
of the constitution, there is apparently
no medium between centralization and
disruption.</p>

<p>The South was making rapid strides
towards commercial recovery; the cotton
crop for the year was excellent, as,
indeed, were the crops generally; but the
recent financial disasters have crippled
trade as well as commerce. People will
neither buy nor sell. Stock lies idle in
the market; large business firms close or
suspend, and the farmers cannot forward
their products; so that the country is
faced by a long winter with nothing to
do, aggravated by a bad business season,
for which the strikers of the preceding
year have themselves partially to blame;
and all ostensibly because one large
banking firm suspended payment!</p>

<p>The only remedy for everything is a
restoration of confidence among all; but
that is the precise thing that is slow to
come. The money market has been in
the hands of commercial gamblers and
tricksters so long that, with our paper
money, which in itself is demoralizing,
commercial gambling seems to be the
acknowledged and legitimate line of
business. Honest men cannot contend
with a world of rogues. American credit
has suffered terribly. If in political affairs
it be true, as Prince Bismarck assured
the world no later than last March,
that "confidence is a tender plant, which,
once destroyed, comes never more," it is
doubly true in matters affecting a man's
pocket.</p>

<p>There is something ominous as well as
startling in this sudden collapse of all
business, all commercial transactions, in
a young, wealthy, powerful country such
as this, in consequence of the failure of
one or two men. It could not be unless
the roots of the evil that wrought their
failure had taken wide and deep hold of
the national heart. There are dangers
more immediate and more fatal than
Cæsars or centralization threatening our
republic. There is something like a rotting
away of the national virtue, purity,
and honor which in themselves constitute
the life of a nation. When we find
dishonesty accepted as a fact, or a state
of affairs rather, against which it is hopeless
to contend; when we find money accepted
as the lever which Archimedes
sought in vain, and that money itself
based on nothing&mdash;paper&mdash;taken on trust,
which does not exist, we have arrived at a
state very nearly approaching to national
decay, and it is high time to look to our
salvation. This can be brought about
only by an adherence to the doctrines of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span>
Christianity, an education of our children
in the laws of Christianity, so as to save
at least the coming generation. Only
one thought will save a nation from dishonesty:
the consciousness that a dishonest
action is a sin and a crime against
Almighty God. When that doctrine is
taught and enforced in our public schools,
and impressed indelibly on the plastic
mind of innocence, the generation will
grow up honest, true, and manly. While
perfectly aware that reasoning of this
kind will scarcely be appreciated "on
the street," nay, would not even be understood,
that is no reason why prominence
should not be given it by those
who have the future of their country at
heart. The generation that grows up
without a Christian education will not
know the meaning of such words as private
or commercial morality.</p>

<p>The history of the year in Europe is
told in a sentence written long before
Rome was founded: "The kings of the
earth stood up, and the princes met together,
against the Lord and against his
Christ." In Germany, the work of the
construction and consolidation of the
new empire is advancing bravely. The
new German Empire is founded on a
military code strengthened by penal
statutes, executed with all the promptness,
vigor, and rigor of military law.
The great feature of the year has been
the passing of the ecclesiastical bills,
into the particulars of which question it
is unnecessary to enter now, as it has already
been dealt with at length in <span class="smcap">The
Catholic World</span>.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> The present aspect
of affairs may be summed up in a sentence:
To be a Catholic is to be a criminal
in the eyes of the state.</p>

<p>Every Catholic society of men, and women
even, living in community together,
have been expelled from Prussian territory
within the year, for the simple reason
that they were Catholics. As an excuse
in the eyes of this keen, honest, liberal
world of the XIXth century for such an
outrage on human liberty, the government
which boasts as its head Prince
Bismarck, whose very name has become a
byword for sagacity and foresight, contents
itself with no better reason than that
these quiet men and women, whose lives
are passed out of the world, are a danger
to the nation that conquered Austria and
France; and the keen, honest, liberal
world finds that reasoning sufficient.
To be logical, the government should
expel all the 8,000,000 Catholics in Prussia,
or the 14,000,000 in the Empire, who
are left behind; for there is not one
shade of difference in the Catholicity of
the societies expelled and that of the
vast body remaining. But as it would
be a difficult undertaking bodily to expel
14,000,000 of human beings from an empire,
and as it would be a costly proceeding
in the end, the half a dozen or more
men who legislate for this vast empire
of 40,000,000 do the best they can under
the circumstances, and strain their ingenuity
to devise means for purging Catholicity
out of the souls of this vast body,
as though the religion of Jesus Christ
were a fatal disease and a poison.</p>

<p>Consequently, the first thing to do was
to change the Prussian constitution,
which guaranteed religious freedom independent
of state control. By an alteration
in Articles XV. and XVIII., religion
was brought under complete subjection
to the state: Prince Bismarck being compelled
to pack the Upper House with his
creatures in order to secure a majority
for the measure. It passed, and its result,
as far as the Catholic Church is concerned,
is easily told.</p>

<p>Catholic bishops, the successors of
the apostles, may no longer exercise
apostolic jurisdiction without permission
from a Protestant government. A Catholic
bishop may not excommunicate a
rebellious Catholic without permission
from a Protestant government, under the
severest penalties.</p>

<p>A Catholic bishop must, under pain
of the severest penalties, acknowledge a
schismatic as a priest; retain him in his
parish, pay him a salary, and allow him to
say Mass and preach false doctrine to his
Catholic congregation.</p>

<p>A Catholic bishop may not, under the
severest penalties, ordain a Catholic
priest, unless the candidate for holy
orders receive the approval of Protestant
government officials.</p>

<p>Catholic seminaries, where students
for the Catholic priesthood are trained,
must accept the supervision of a Protestant
official and the programme of education
prescribed by a Protestant government,
which has declared war against their
religion. If the bishop does not accept
these conditions, the seminary is closed.</p>

<p>Catholic candidates for holy orders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>
cannot be exempted from military service;
the term of military service embraces
a period of twelve years.</p>

<p>Catholic candidates for orders may
not be admitted to holy orders before
passing three years at a state university
under the lectures of Protestant or infidel
professors. On their entrance to the
university they must matriculate to the
satisfaction of those professors, and on
leaving it they must pass a rigorous examination,
also to the satisfaction of
those professors.</p>

<p>A Catholic bishop may not appoint to
or remove a Catholic priest from any
parish without the permission of the
Protestant government. If he does so,
the marriages celebrated by such a priest
are not recognized by law, and the children
are consequently illegitimate in the eyes
of the law! This too under a government
which recognizes and encourages by every
means in its power civil marriages, without
the form of any religious ceremony
whatsoever. Surely this is an <em>Evangelical</em>
power!</p>

<p>Such, in brief, is a sketch of what these
ecclesiastical bills mean. The sketch,
hasty and incomplete as it is, requires no
comment. A running comment is kept
up every day, as readers may see for
themselves, by cable despatches announcing
penalties inflicted upon this bishop
and that for refusing to obey laws that
not only the Gospel of our Lord Jesus
Christ and the apostolic writings forbid
him, under pain of losing his soul, to obey,
but against which the heart of any man
with an ounce of freedom and honesty in
his nature must revolt as from a foul offence.
But the cable tells not a tithe of
the story. Every penalty of the law in all
the cases mentioned above has been and
is being rigorously, nay bitterly, enforced;
and a milder mode of treatment is scarcely
to be looked for from the recent return
of Prince Bismarck to the Prussian premiership,
with full control this time over
the cabinet.</p>

<p>It is difficult, in these days and in this
country of all others, to write or speak
with calmness of this cool assumption of
absolute power over soul and body&mdash;the
souls and bodies of 40,000,000 of human
beings whom God created&mdash;by one or two
men, and of its hypocritical justification
by appeals to the Deity himself.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> It is
still more difficult to speak or write with
calmness of the undisguised or ill disguised
approval which such barbarous enactments
have evoked in free America in
the columns of Protestant religious or
quasi-religious journals. Is religious
freedom one thing here and another thing
in Germany? Or is this country indeed,
as some allege, ripe for absolutism?</p>

<p>The spirit that would wipe out the
church of Christ if it could, that stifles
every breath of religious freedom, naturally
and as a matter of course laughs at
such a thing as pretensions to political
freedom in any sense. Consequently, it
was no surprise to see, in the face of the
protest of the majority, the civil as well as
foreign polity of the states that compose
this German Empire, scarce yet two years
old, transferred to the bureau that sits at
Berlin. These states were free three
years ago, governing themselves by their
own laws. They must now be ruled internally
as well as externally by the laws
of the empire, that is to say, by Prussia;
for the imperial chancellor is the Prussian
premier, with full control over the
cabinet. In a word, Germany is to be
Prussianized. Prince Bismarck is no
lover of half-measures. Already it was
decreed, in spite of opposition, that the
Prussian military code should serve for
the whole empire. The bill for the organization
of the imperial army retains
the main features of the former organization.
The term of military service is fixed
at twelve years, and, as already seen,
not even the orders which indelibly stamp
a man as the consecrated priest of God,
can save him from becoming a man of
war.</p>

<p>Now, this one item of itself is sufficient
to condemn this government in the eyes
of humanity. What is the meaning of
the words, "twelve years of military
service"? Prussian military service is
no playing at soldiers, be it remembered,
like our militia here or in England. The
average life of a man in these days probably
does not much exceed thirty-six
years. Yet in this new German empire
the men who go to compose its 40,000,000
of human souls are compelled to devote
one-third&mdash;the best twelve years of their
lives&mdash;to what?</p>

<p>To serve in the armies of a tyrannical
despot, who styles himself "William, by
the grace of God"&mdash;to spend those best
twelve years of their lives in learning the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>
most expeditious method of killing their
fellow-Christians! And that is what the
glorious German Empire means.</p>

<p>What wonder that Germans should already
fly in such numbers from this glorious
and consolidated empire as to cause
the same government that forbids freedom
of religion to prohibit freedom of emigration?
As all the world has seen, the German
government is compelled to throw
every obstacle in the way of its subjects
to prevent their flying to this country.
Does that betoken soundness, and a
government grateful to the people? In
the face of that one fact, it is needless to
call to mind the riots that have continued
at intervals throughout the year in various
parts of the country, and the cruelty with
which they were put down. What wonder
that, even in the face of a military
power, the Catholic party, persecuted as
it is, should have gained, on Protestant
concession, a small but decided increase
on the vote of last year? What wonder
that the liberty of the press should be
attacked, and the journals that dared to
publish the Papal Allocution confiscated?</p>

<p>It has been alleged all along that Catholics
have been the foes of the unity of Germany.
The allegation is utterly false. It
is alleged by the Prussian government
that they conspire against the empire,
from the bishops down. Give us the
proofs, say the Catholics; lay your finger
on the words or the acts of conspiracy.
The government refuses to take up the
open, manly challenge. It knew that its
charge was false. But had it, by any
chance, been true, who shall say that a
government that enforces such barbarous
laws as those above given, which is compelled
to resort to force in order to keep
its subjects in the country, which compels
every man to devote the best part of his
life to preparation for war, whose revenues
go only to swell vast armaments and
fortify frontiers, which denies not only all
religious but all political freedom&mdash;practically
one and the same thing&mdash;is not a
curse rather than a blessing to mankind?
The German Empire, as it stands to-day,
is nothing else than a rampant, military
Prussian despotism&mdash;a danger not only
to its sister nations in Europe, but to the
world.</p>

<p>In Italy the story is much the same;
and the wonder is the sufferance, in these
days of vaunted enlightenment and freedom,
of the utter violation and disregard
on the part of governments of every human
right, even to the seizure of private
property. The bill for the appropriation
by the state of church property passed
through the Italian parliament. These
fine words, "appropriation," "parliament,"
"debates," in this "house" and
in that, seem to throw dust in the eyes of
men who, when their own property is
touched, are particularly keen-sighted,
though the "appropriation" go not beyond
a single dollar. This high-sounding
measure simply means that the Italian
parliament has forcibly taken possession
of three millions' worth and upwards of
property to which, in the face of earth and
heaven, it had not one jot, one tittle, one
shade of claim in any form.</p>

<p>Three years ago, the present Italian
parliament&mdash;Italian by courtesy&mdash;was not
known in Rome. The Pope was as much
a sovereign as Victor Emanuel. The
withdrawal of the French troops left the
Sovereign Pontiff defenceless, and let in
the King of Sardinia. Unprovoked and
uninvited, he took violent possession of
the slender remnant of the Papal States
left to the Pope, and proclaimed himself
King of Italy&mdash;the Pope still remaining
on the soil which his predecessors owned
and governed before the race of Victor
Emanuel existed. Under the Papal rule,
certain religious corporations&mdash;the religious
orders and societies&mdash;rented, purchased,
or owned certain property. The
property belonged to those corporations
as surely and as sacredly as property can
belong to any man or body of men. Of
course, when this Italian government laid
its sacrilegious hand on the domain of the
Vicar of Jesus Christ, it was scarcely to
be expected that, with the example of
Henry VIII. of England and, more recently,
of William of Prussia before its
eyes, it would stop short at the property
of religious corporations. Consequently,
we hear of a bill for the appropriation of
this private property by the state. It is
debated, and, after the usual objections to
what is already a foregone conclusion, the
property is seized by the state, and the
owners turned adrift over the world.</p>

<p>When men, and by no means admirable
men, calling themselves governments,
play thus fast and loose with every
vested right, Catholics are told, because
they are so bold as to defend their own,
that they are and, cannot be other than
disloyal to that nowadays obscure thing,
a state! The Vicar of Jesus Christ lifts
up his voice, and, after his many warn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>ings,
pronounces the solemn sentence of
major excommunication on all who have
had hand, act, or part in these sacrilegious
transactions, which the science of
jurisprudence itself condemns utterly&mdash;and
free men, with sound ideas on the
rights of property, whatever may be their
opinion on the rights of religion, find in
his utterances insolence or ravings.</p>

<p>Treasures of art, libraries that are historical
relics, relics of the sainted dead,
all that the monasteries and convents
held, flood the Italian market, and are
bought up "for a song"; while the
property itself is up at auction to the
highest bidder. And what has this government
done for the country? Has it,
in a manner, justified its seizure by improving
the condition of the people?</p>

<p>It only needs to read any of the Roman
correspondents of the English or American
press to know that never did brigandage
exist in a more flourishing condition
in Italy than since the entry of
Victor Emanuel into Rome. Many Protestant
correspondents, be it remembered,
intimate plainly enough that the authorities
wink at the brigands. Capture, of
course, is made once in a while; but so
occasionally as only to serve "<i lang="fr">pour encourager
les autres</i>." But, after all, there is no
barometer like a man's pocket; and the
rise and fall of taxation is a very safe indicator
of the state of the political mart.
On this point a little comparison will be
found instructive.</p>

<p>The <cite>New York Herald</cite>, in the spring of
this year, in an article entitled "The
Debts of the State&mdash;Important Questions
for Taxpayers," mentions, as the revelation
of "a startling fact," that "the aggregate
debt of the several counties,
cities, towns, and villages of the State of
New York, for which the taxpayers are
responsible, exceeds two hundred and
fourteen million dollars. This is more
than ten and a half per cent. upon the
assessed valuation of all property in the
State.... If to this total debt of the
subdivisions of the State be added that
of the State itself, ... we have as the entire
corporate debt of the State $239,685,902&mdash;almost
twelve per cent. of the whole
assessment of property." "This is a heavy
encumbrance upon every man's and
every woman's estate. It has grown out of
a long course of reckless abuse of power,
too lightly confided to legislative and the
various representative bodies which control
the State in its several divisions.
Lavish extravagance has been too often
authorized in expenditures for the public
account, by men who carefully guard
their private interests and credit, and it
is no secret that many of the burdens imposed
upon the taxpayers have enriched
those who made the appropriations. How
are these onerous obligations to be met?
Or are they to be paid at all?"</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether many of the taxpayers
in New York State will feel inclined
to call in question the strictures
here involved. At all events, the ex-Tammany
chieftain has recently been
consigned to the penitentiary. Turn we
now to the taxation in Rome since the
commencement of the Emanuel <i lang="fr">régime</i>.
A <cite>Herald</cite> correspondent, who was despatched
to describe the death of our
Holy Father, and the election of his successor,
and, finding his time heavy on his
hands&mdash;as the Pope, in the face of an outraged
world, refused to die before his
Master called him&mdash;collected and sent
back the following little items:</p>

<p>This is an increase of 32½ percent.,
or, not including the extra tax on mortmain
property, 28½ per cent., within, at
the time of writing, about two years.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
Would the taxpayers of New York, who
are presumably more wealthy than those
of Rome, consider such an increase of
taxation as that in two or three years "a
startling fact"? And what is there to
show for it? Absolutely nothing. All
sorts of fine schemes for improvement
of the city and such like are in existence&mdash;upon
paper; unfortunately, they
remain there. There is a grand new
opera-house to be built, however. That
is something. And then those royal
visits to Austria and Germany must have
cost something. And Victor Emanuel
himself and his worthy son Humbert lead
rather expensive lives. In the account
of New Year's Day at Rome, a twelve-month
since, we find the president of the
chamber requesting his majesty to take
more care of his health. And his majesty
in response acknowledges the necessity
of so doing, while he assured
the president that arrangements existed
which would ensure that the unity and
liberty of Italy would in no case be endangered.</p>

<p>And here the Roman correspondent
of the London <cite>Times</cite>, who, like most
special correspondents of that journal,
hates the Pope and the Papacy with a
solid Saxon hatred that not even what is
passing under his own eyes can remove,
furnishes us with a little further information
on the same point:</p>

<p>"The rigorous exaction of the taxes,
referred to in former letters, has been a
great element of discontent, especially
in the south, which has suffered in many
respects from the formation of the Italian
kingdom. The only chance of rescuing
the country [What country?&mdash;The exchequer
of Victor Emanuel.] from its
severe financial difficulties and probably
from bankruptcy, was in such an exaction,
but it has not the less pressed very
cruelly on many needy classes. And it
must be owned that, instead of seeking
to soothe the sufferings of the taxpayers,
Signor Sella has rather increased them by
his cynical mode of treatment. People
think it bad enough to be mulcted until
they have scarcely enough left to live
upon, and are not in a mood to be made
game of also"&mdash;and much more in the
same strain.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>Of the banishment of the religious orders
and societies from Italy, which recently
came into effect, the same only
can be said as of the German expulsion.
Our Holy Father, in receiving the generals
of the various religious orders on
January 2, said in reply to their address:
"It is the third time during my life that
religious orders have been suppressed.
These corporations have always been the
support of the church, and it is a dispensation
of God that they should from time
to time undergo such vicissitudes. This
is a secret of Providence which I may
not unravel, but I strive to see whether
an angel may not be coming to aid the
church. I do not say that I desire the
destroying angel who visited the host of
Sennacherib in order to save the chosen
people of God. No, I have not that
thought. I wish for an angel who might
convert all hearts. We are in exile; we
must come before God with the powerful
arm of prayer, in order to obtain, if not
what we wish, at least some assuagement
of our misfortunes."</p>

<p>At the beginning of summer the world
was excited by a rumor of the Pope's
sickness unto death, and it was curious
to observe the effect of the rumor upon
the non-Catholic world. Pius IX. has
already seen more than "the years of
Peter." He has sustained in his own
person the trials of Peter. But whatever
the end may be which Jesus Christ has
reserved for the close of the glorious career
of his true Vicar, Pius IX. will leave
this world, his soul borne up on the
prayers and blessings of two hundred
million hearts, while his name will for
ever shine resplendent on the glittering
scroll of the successors of Peter.</p>

<p>"On his return from Versailles, M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span>
Thiers was greeted at the railway station
by a crowd which was awaiting him there
with loud cries of <i lang="fr">Vive M. Thiers! Vive
le Président!</i>" So runs a despatch from
Paris on New Year's Day, 1873. How
oddly it reads now! <i lang="fr">Le Président est
mort: Vive le Président!</i> M. Thiers is
politically as dead as he that was laid in
his quiet grave at Chiselhurst in the first
month of the year. It almost requires
a strained effort of the mind to recall the
fact that a short year ago M. Thiers was
the master of the situation in France, receiving
deputations and congratulations
on New Year's, and talking of his presidential
visit to the Vienna exhibition.
A quiet but significant little despatch of
the same date may partly explain the
rapid collapse of M. Thiers: "Many
persons of political distinction left their
names at the residence of the Orleans
princes." <span class="smcap">The Catholic World</span> for last
January, in its review of the year 1872,
said on the French question: "But
Thiers cannot last, and what is to follow?
The country would not bear the rule of
the man of Sedan.... The speech of
the Duc d'Audiffret-Pasquier, on the
army contracts, killed Napoleonism for
the nonce. We can only hope for the
best in France from some other and nobler
sprout of former dynasties; we cannot
foresee it."</p>

<p>It is needless to tell here the story of
how M. Thiers was overthrown, or to
comment on it, beyond the timeworn
illustration that as a rule it is a radical
mistake for any one man to set himself
up as a necessity for a nation; yet such
a mistake is the commonest indulged in
by rulers (<i lang="la">in esse</i> or <i lang="la">in posse</i>, as may be).
In the midst of intense excitement in
that most excitable of capitals, Paris,
Marshal MacMahon was summoned by
the majority of the Assembly to succeed
M. Thiers. He placed himself as an impersonal
instrument in the hands of the
government, promising by the aid of
"God and the army" to guarantee
peace. He chose a conservative government.
Order has been kept. The last
farthing of the indemnity to Germany has
been paid, and the last German soldier
has quitted France.</p>

<p>A volume might be written on those
few words&mdash;the indemnity has been paid:
the last German soldier has quitted
France. There is nothing but silent
wonder for this marvellous feat, which in
its way casts into the shade even the
German conquest of France. A nation
whose armies were one after the other
shattered in a few months, an empire destroyed,
an emperor led into captivity;
its great fortresses beaten down, its
capital besieged and taken twice over,
first by the foe, after by its own soldiers
from the hands of its suicidal children;
two provinces, rich and fair, with their
cities and peoples, amounting to a million
and a half, taken away; its raw levies
scattered into mist at a ruinous waste of
life and money; its government overthrown
and the entire national system
overturned, so that men turned this way
and that, and nowhere found a ruler.
Men, money, provinces, cities, emperor,
empire, rulers&mdash;all gone; commerce destroyed,
the heart of the nation sore with
resentment and stricken with sorrow:
and all this crowded into a few months!
Yet within less than three years this
fickle, false, degenerate French nation&mdash;for
such was the general character attributed
to it after the late war&mdash;has restored
its armies, has maintained peace,
although even yet it can scarcely be said
to have a permanent government, has set
its commerce again afloat, and has rid
itself of the foe at a cost that, when proposed,
the whole world deemed fabulous.</p>

<p>One cannot help wondering now
whether Prince Bismarck was prescient
enough to foresee that France could
afford to pay the fabulous sum for which
he stipulated&mdash;more than a billion dollars.
The figures are easily written down
on paper, the words slip glibly from the
lips, yet they signify a sum of money
whose immensity, and the power that it
contains for good or for evil, it is well-nigh
impossible for the mind of man to conceive.
When first bruited, the whole
world looked aghast and refused to consider
the idea that Prince Bismarck, especially
after what the nation had suffered,
could stipulate for the payment of so
vast a sum&mdash;one that simply implied national
bankruptcy. The world misjudged
Prince Bismarck, and possibly he misjudged
the power and vitality of the nation
that lay quivering under his iron heel, or
he might have demanded more. Yet here
two years afterwards the almost impossible
sum is told out to the last farthing,
and the Germans are over the border
again, with their gripe still on two French
provinces, hastening fast to fortify and
defend them from attack.</p>

<p>With what France has accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span>
in these short months before our eyes,
how irresistibly the thought comes to
one&mdash;would it not have been wiser, truer
patriotism, a loftier statesmanship, to
have left those two provinces to France,
and not hold them up for ever before her
eyes as the fairest prize pitilessly wrung
from her in her hour of anguish? Has
not Prince Bismarck, or the Emperor, or
Von Moltke, or whomsoever's doing it
was, left the germ of future wars as a
legacy to be fought by those yet unborn,
when they shall be rotting in their
graves?</p>

<p>A month or two ago, and the crown
that once belonged to his race seemed
to offer itself to the grasp of the Count
of Chambord. Our readers know the
story too well to repeat it here. All that
need be said is, he refused it. Henri
Cinq is very unlike Henri Quatre, the
founder of his race. That Protestant
gentleman deemed a throne worth a
Mass; his Catholic descendant deems a
throne insufficient to compensate him for
a broken word or a wavering in principle.
It is a lesson to kings; and if there
be such a thing as royalty in these days&mdash;royalty
as men once knew, or thought
they knew, it&mdash;surely it belongs to the man
who could quietly turn aside from a
crown within his reach when he could
not wear, as the brightest jewels therein,
truth and honor untarnished. Verily
Henri Cinq is the most royal of the Bourbons,
and the line of crowned heads is
redeemed in the person of their crown-less
descendant. <i lang="fr">Vive la France! Vive
Henri Cinq!</i></p>

<p>The crown which all felt to be virtually
offered to him being refused, the conservative
government, with MacMahon at
its head, still remains in office, and a
provisional government is voted for seven
years. It is doubtful whether it will
live that time. France is still open to
eruption. Yet the present government
deserves well of the country. It has
shown itself wise, calm, and moderate.
The debt was paid off, and the nation
scarcely seemed to recognize the fact.
How that vast sum of money was collected
so rapidly and transferred to Berlin,
where it came from, and how it
was brought together at so short a notice,
without any one apparently feeling
the worse for it, is, and will probably remain,
one of the mysteries of finance.</p>

<p>It is as impossible this year as it was
last to forecast the French horoscope.
The nation has accomplished wonders,
and shown itself capable of everything
save choosing a government which could
satisfy the whole body. Probably such
a government is impossible. Republicanism,
in our sense of the word, is as
far off from France as ever. Sooner or
later some man will again possess himself
of the power in France, unless, as is
still not improbable, <em>the nation</em> invite the
Count of Chambord. The Duc d'Aumale
has "won golden opinions from all
sorts of men," and continues to win
them. He is conducting the trial of Marshal
Bazaine with great keenness and
discretion.</p>

<p>"The man of Sedan" went to sleep at
last as the year opened. He is reported
to have died a Christian death, though
the evidence of adequate reparation for
his past crimes is wanting. Whatever he
may have been, he left many close personal
friends behind him. He did more
than this: he left a party, or the germ of
one, in that fatal legacy of the "Napoleonic
idea," to his young son, who, if
his life be spared, will probably guard it
well, and follow closely in the footsteps
of his father, if he have the chance to do
so, which God forefend! His English
education will not harm him; and he
has seen too much of France and imperialism
to relinquish an empire which,
unless God give him grace to learn a
better wisdom than that which his father
bequeathed, he cannot fail to consider
his by right. For the present he is harmless
enough personally; but if France
continues in its unsettled state, and if
the son inherit any of the power and
scheming of the race, he is as likely as
any other to be the coming man. We
trust, however, that neither of these conditions
will be verified.</p>

<p>The death of the Emperor Napoleon
undoubtedly lightened France. This is
not the time to examine his actions
or his policy. He is now part, and a
very large part, of history; and history
will paint him as it has painted better
and greater men&mdash;in light and shade.</p>

<p>The pilgrimages to the various French
shrines were a feature of the year, drawing
the eyes of the world to France, and
the blessing of heaven on France. Millions
of pilgrims of all classes, ages, and
cast of politics visited La Salette, Paray-le-Monial,
Our Lady of Lourdes, and a
multitude of other shrines. The whole
world looked on with wonder. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>
was abundance of ridicule among a class
of writers from whose pens commendation
would be an insult. One pilgrimage
went from Protestant England under the
leadership of the Duke of Norfolk, hereditary
Earl Marshal of England. The leading
secular newspapers, as a rule, gave
very fair and respectful accounts. If it
were not invidious to select from many,
the letters of the correspondents of the
London <cite>Times</cite> in England, and of the
New York <cite>Herald</cite> in this country&mdash;particularly
the latter&mdash;were admirable in
tone, spirit, and style. Pilgrimages were
prohibited in Italy and Germany, on the
ground that they were political assemblages.
They seem rather likely to increase
than to diminish in the coming
year, and undoubtedly they have imparted
a fresh impetus to faith, and returned a
solemn answer to the "men of the time,"
the philosophers of the age, who find it
so easy to disbelieve in God.</p>

<p>1873 will be memorable in Spanish
annals. The heart sickens and shrinks
from going over the dismal record. It is
almost startling to read of "the king"
receiving deputations on New Year's,
and that king Amadeus. His abdication
can scarcely have caused surprise to persons
who had the slightest inkling of the
real state of affairs in Spain. <span class="smcap">The Catholic
World</span>, in its review of last year, although
matters smiled on Amadeus at
the time, said: "We do not expect to
find Amadeus' name at the head of the
Spanish government this day twelve-month."
It said also, "A good regent,
not Montpensier, might bring about the
restoration of Don Alfonso; but where
is such a regent? Don Carlos possesses
the greatest amount of genuine loyalty
to his name and cause, and he would be
the winning man, could he only manage
his rising in a more efficient manner."
How far those predictions have been
verified by events our readers may satisfy
themselves. They required, indeed,
no very keen insight to make.</p>

<p>Previous to the abdication of Amadeus,
the Carlist insurrection, under the
leadership of Prince Alfonso, the brother
of Don Carlos, Saballs, and a number of
other chieftains of greater or less note,
again broke forth with renewed vigor.
After his abdication, the government was
all at sea; and from that time to the present
date there has been nothing but
a succession of changes of government,
one as incapable as another, until the
country no longer presents the appearance
of a nation. Don Carlos appeared
at the head of his forces early in the
year. Frequent reports of Carlist annihilation
have kept the telegraph wires
busily employed ever since; yet, singular
to relate, Don Carlos at present is actual
king in the north of Spain. The forces
sent against him have been defeated in
every important engagement, and he
only needs artillery to advance into the
heart of the country. How it will go
with him during the coming winter, which
is rigorous in the north, remains to be
seen. Insurrections broke out in various
parts of the country, resulting, in some
places, in scenes of horror and inhumanity,
compared with which the horrors of
the Commune in Paris were humane.
Men seemed possessed by fiends, and
the Spanish idea of a federal republic
took the form of every petty town its own
absolute sovereign. There was serious
danger more than once of such insignificant
governments embroiling themselves
with foreign powers. Part of the fleet
revolted, and is still in revolt. Part of
the army endeavored to do so more than
once. They cannot but despise wild
theorists of the Castelar type, who would
heal a bleeding nation with windy
speeches. The future looks dark for
Spain; and its only hope now lies in
Don Carlos gaining the throne as speedily
as he may. The country is overwhelmed
with financial dangers, and it
will take a cycle of peace and sound government
to atone for the untold evils of
these few years of excess. As matters
now stand, victory sits on the helm of
Don Carlos, and the coming year will
probably find him King of Spain. We
hope and believe that he will prove himself
worthy of the vast sacrifices which
have been made in his favor, and show
as a wise, temperate, and truly Catholic
sovereign over a noble race run mad
with riot. As for a Spanish republic,
Alcoy and Cartagena indicate what that
means.</p>

<p>In this connection it would seem that
we should take some notice of the case of
the <em>Virginius</em>; but, at the time of sending
this to press (Nov. 29), the question is too
incomplete and unsettled to enable us to
announce the final solution, which will
have become a fact when these lines are
read. To pronounce our own judgment
on the merits of the case, in the brief and
superficial manner to which our limits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span>
would restrict us, we are unwilling. We
merely say one thing, which is obvious on
the face of things, that there was no sufficient
reason to justify the hurried and
summary massacre of the prisoners captured
on the <em>Virginius</em>. Filibustering we
detest as a crime. Nevertheless, Cuba
has been frightfully misgoverned. The
reconciliation of Cuba to Spanish rule is
impossible. If it can be rightfully made
a free state, or annexed to the United
States, we think it will be a benefit to
the Cubans to be set free from Spanish
rule.</p>

<p>The great feature of the English year
has been the educational question&mdash;a
question that at present is agitating the
world, and is debated alike throughout
all Europe, in our own country, in the
states of South America, in India even,
and in Australia. It is summed up in
this: Shall education be Christian or not?
If Christian, it tends to make the coming
race bad citizens, inasmuch as it teaches
children that there is a God, whose laws
even governments must obey. There are
side issues, but that constitutes the main
point, however governments may seek to
disguise the fact. If unchristian, the
children learn that they are only graduating
to become capable citizens of
the state, and that that is their highest
duty. This is paganism, and to this doctrine
of education Christians cannot consent.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone, finding his party shaking,
once more strove to consolidate and
make it a unit on an Irish question. He
took up the Irish educational grievance&mdash;and
undoubtedly a sore grievance it is&mdash;and
tried to construct a university which
should be equally acceptable to all creeds
and no creeds. As might have been expected,
it proved acceptable to none. Mr.
Gladstone's model university was to exclude
chairs of theology, philosophy, and
history. The very proposal is sufficient
to show how impossible it was for Catholics
to support such a measure. The
Irish vote very rightly turned the scale
against him, and Mr. Disraeli was credited
with a victory. After a threatened
dissolution, the Gladstone government
resumed, and the conservative gains have
gone on steadily increasing, so that it is
not at all improbable that Mr. Disraeli
will find himself and the conservative
party in power after the next general
elections.</p>

<p>The British government paid to the
United States the amount of the Geneva
award&mdash;£3,500,000.</p>

<p>A war is being waged against the
Ashantees, successfully so far. The Australian
colonies are advancing in wealth
and independence. From Bengal, at the
close of the year, comes a dread rumor
of famine that seems to be only too well
founded. There was an increase in the
price of coal, resulting, apparently, from
a report of its scarcity.</p>

<p>In the early part of the year, a strike
of the miners and iron-workers of South
Wales, by which 60,000 men were thrown
out of employment, extended over two
months. It was finally settled by mutual
concessions on the part of masters and
men. It evinced the growing power of
trades-unions; but, at the same time, a
few figures, furnished by the correspondent
of the London <cite>Times</cite>, give sad evidence
of what a losing game strikes really
are when they can possibly be avoided.</p>

<p>The correspondent writes from Merthyr,
February 9, while the strike was
still in progress: "A few figures, showing
the cost of the present struggle, are
instructive. To-day the strikers enter
upon the seventh week of its duration.
Not a stroke of work has been done by
over 60,000 persons since the 28th December
last. In giving that figure, the
number is under-estimated rather than
exaggerated. The average weekly earnings
of this industrial host was £60,000,
while at the monthly pays or settlements
it would not be going beyond the truth
to say the payment exceeded the ordinary
weekly draws by from 50 to 60 per cent.
In the six weeks of idleness, therefore,
the workmen have lost, in round figures,
£400,000. The withdrawal of this vast
sum from the circulation of the district
has created such a dearth of money as
no tradesman has ever experienced before.
The strike payment of the Miners'
Union has amounted at the utmost to
only £15,000&mdash;a miserable pittance compared
with the sum which would have
been distributed through the various channels
of trade had the works continued
in operation." The past almost unprecedentedly
dull business year in New York
was owing, in great measure, to the
strikes in the busiest season of 1872.</p>

<p>In Ireland, and among the Irish in
England and Scotland, the agitation for
home rule has spread with a vigor that
promises success. Recently the Irish
prelates have given in their adherence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span>
to the programme, and thus sanctioned
the movement by the voice of the church.
A cable message informs us that Mr.
Disraeli has seized upon this fact to warn
the world generally, and Mr. Disraeli's
proverbially slow-witted party particularly,
that the contest between the Catholic
Church and the world is rapidly coming
to a head, and will probably soon be
fought out by ordeal of battle. Mr. Disraeli
inherits a keen scent for what is
likely to take in the market, whether of
politics or a more vulgar kind of commodity.
He is at a loss for a party-cry,
and has happily seized upon one that
of all others is likely to commend itself
to the British bucolic intellect. In
the meantime, the Irish at home may
remember that in all their struggles,
while they very wisely look to themselves
to right themselves, they may count on
fast friends, chiefly of their own race,
scattered through every English-speaking
people, whose voices, at least, will be
lifted up in their favor. Let them continue
to show such clean calendars as in
the past year's assizes&mdash;in itself a very
strong proof for the right, since it involves
the power of self-government&mdash;and self-government
cannot tarry much longer.
The solemn consecration of the whole
country to the Sacred Heart, and of
Armagh Cathedral, are two events that
will live in Irish history. The general
wonder evoked by the revolt of an Irish
priest against his bishop furnished a
striking testimony to the unity of the
church.</p>

<p>Russia has advanced a step farther into
Asia and closer upon the British possessions.
Khiva was captured, after a
show of resistance by the forces of the
khan. The collision between these two
powers in the East is not far distant.
Russia has not yet forgotten Sebastopol;
and England showed a restive spirit at the
advance of its great rival into the East
that at one time threatened to burst forth
into open opposition to the expedition.
The contest is only delayed for a time.
Russia internally is not as calm as it
might be. We hear from time to time of
the eruptions of strange secret societies.
Undoubtedly socialism is at work; and
in these days, not despotism, but rational
freedom, is the only bulwark against
its advance. The year opened with the
illness of the czarowitz. He recovered
sufficiently to absent himself from St.
Petersburg just before the kaiser entered
to greet the czar. The love of the
czarowitz for the Prussians is too well
known not to give a significance to his
hurried departure on the arrival of their
emperor in his father's capital.</p>

<p>Austria opened a universal exposition
at Vienna with a financial panic. The
country has under consideration the legislation
of the period&mdash;a bill for the regulation
of the affairs of church and state.
Austria is not too strong as it stands; it
will gain little if it join in the universal
attack upon the church of Christ and
his Vicar.</p>

<p>Switzerland has essayed the <i lang="fr">rôle</i> of
Bismarck admirably. It has turned everybody
in and everybody out, and church
and chapel topsy-turvy, in right royal
fashion. All the ecclesiastical laws of
Prussia have been introduced there, with
the addition that the <i lang="fr">curés</i> were elective.
Of course, Catholics could not vote for
the election of their <i lang="fr">curés</i>; consequently,
they did not appear at the polls in this
matter. But there are Catholics enough
in Switzerland, and Italy also, to make
themselves felt at the polls in other matters,
and it seems that the chief remedy
for their evils rests in their own hands.
In Germany, as was seen, the Catholics
have gained a decisive increase on their
vote of last year, however small; and, to
judge of the future by the past, those
German delegates will fight the battle of
God and freedom nobly. In England
Catholics are active at the polls, and,
small a minority as they are, their vote
tells.</p>

<p>Turning now to the East, every year
seems to bring it nearer to the West, and
possibly to the fulfilment of the promise
that F. Thebaud brings out so strongly
in his powerful work on <cite>The Irish Race</cite>&mdash;to
the time when the sons of Japheth
shall "take possession of the tents of
Sem." During the past year, the Emperor
of China made a concession unprecedented
in Chinese history, and doubtless
many an old political head shakes
over the headlong rate at which the
Chinese constitution is being driven to
destruction. The Brother of the Sun&mdash;we
believe that is the relationship&mdash;has
allowed foreign potentates to present
themselves at court after the fashion of
the outer barbarians. This, however, is
really an important concession, inasmuch
as when the representatives of civilized
governments have access directly to the
person of the emperor, European and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span>
American subjects resident in China
stand a better chance of having the many
annoyances and grievances put in their
way redressed; and the moral effect of
the imperial concession on the narrow-minded
Chinese nation cannot fail to be
of benefit.</p>

<p>Japan seems earnest in its endeavor to
become Europeanized as rapidly as possible.
But it was as near, or nearer, centuries
ago, when S. Francis Xavier confuted
the Bonzes. The narrowness
and selfishness of European traders
alone prevented the nation from becoming
Christian, probably, at that time.
Much depends, therefore, on the representatives
of foreign governments. If
they are wise and large-hearted Christian
men, they may prove apostles to this
nation, which seems to possess so many
admirable elements; but if, as so often
seems the case, they are only second-hand
agents of Bible societies and narrow-minded
bigots, we may as well resign
all hope of Japan. Some outrage
is sure to recur sooner or later with lamentable
results. Certainly, as a rule,
our own foreign diplomats are not a
class of men who reflect too much credit
on the American nation. They appear
to have been chosen blindly or at hap-hazard,
in return for some electioneering
service. Such is not the spirit that
should move the government of a nation
like ours, or any nation, to select representative
men. They should be truly
representative men of this great people,
large and liberal-minded, with no bias
whatever, but an eye single as that of
justice.</p>

<p>Persia has also opened her gates and
let forth her king to see the world.
What impression the "civilized" world
made on Nasr-ed-Deen<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> would be something
worth knowing. He traversed
Europe. He went to Russia, and the
czar showed him armies; he visited Berlin,
and the kaiser showed him other
armies; he went to Austria&mdash;armies
again; England&mdash;armies, a navy this
time, and a lord mayor; France&mdash;more
armies; Italy&mdash;armies still; and the
king of kings went back again to Persia
to open his kingdom to civilized governments.
Belgium showed him the inside
of a Christian temple for the first time,
as he assured the Papal Nuncio, when
expressing his regret at not being able
to visit the Sovereign Pontiff. Can we
wonder that the shah was soon weary
of his journey? Civilization could show
him no grander sight than millions of
men drawn up in battle array and all the
paraphernalia of war. It exhausted itself
in that&mdash;armies and nothing more. Yes,
there was something more&mdash;ballets.</p>

<p>The shah seems to have pawned his
kingdom for a period of twenty years to
Baron Reuter, who is to do what he
pleases with it in the interim in the construction
of railways, canals, and other
means of internal development, he paying
the monarch £20,000 annually and
a tithe of the income resulting from
the improvements. It seems a hazardous
undertaking in such a country; but the
man who undertook it doubtless "counted
the costs" beforehand.</p>

<p>The mission of Sir Bartle Frere from
the British government to the interior of
Africa, with a view to the putting a stop to
the barbarities of the slave-trade, promises,
in connection with the expedition under
Sir Samuel Baker, to open up a road
to European intercourse with the natives
of the interior. Some German scientists
in Berlin also set on foot during the past
year an association for the promotion of
the exploration of Africa.</p>

<p>In the states of South America the same
strife that we have witnessed in Europe is
being waged, which, under the name of
church and state, really means the absolutism
of the state. The members of the
Society of Jesus and of other societies
and orders have been expelled from
Mexico and several other states. Mexico
has decreed civil marriage, as has also
Brazil, whose Masonic premier and cabinet
are entering on a persecution of the
bishops for excommunicating members
of secret societies. During the year, the
city of San Salvador was utterly destroyed
by an earthquake. The political order
in these South American states corresponds
very closely with their natural order.
They exist in a chronic state of
revolution and eruption.</p>

<p>In the natural order there have been
furious storms, fraught with disaster to
life and property; although lives lost in
this manner have been insignificant in
number compared with loss resulting
from wrecks owing mainly to neglect, as
in the case of the <em>Northfleet</em> and the <em>Atlantic</em>,
and several railroad disasters on a
large scale. Boston was again visited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span>
by fire, but escaped with a loss less severe
than before. The flooding of the
Po once more brought disaster upon
Italy, as did our own annual freshets
upon us in the spring. With the exception
of the threatened famine in Bengal,
the seasons have been propitious, and
the want which threatens the United
States particularly during the coming
year is due mainly to financial panics
and strikes.</p>

<p>Within the past year, Berlin, Vienna,
and New York have known panics, all
seemingly resulting from the same immediate
cause&mdash;the failure of one or two
great houses; while the markets of the
world have been threatened in consequence.
Failures of one or two great
houses could not possibly affect in so
terrible a manner all kinds of business
were it not that there was something
radically wrong at the bottom&mdash;an evil
leaven that has spread to the whole commercial
mass. It would probably be a
puzzle, even to a financier, to lay before
the world the secrets of these periodical
panics, resulting in ruin to so many outside
of the comparative few immediately
concerned. It looks as though, in this
money-getting age, and among our own
money-getting people particularly&mdash;on
which subject the Holy Father this year
addressed to us a special warning&mdash;the
mass of men were animated by the principle,
"Get money at all costs; never
mind the means." Even the greatest
houses live on a system of puff. In private
life the man who lives beyond his
means must sooner or later come to grief,
and face ruin or roguery. In business
the same rule must hold good. Vast
establishments are conducted on a system
vitally unsound. Probably there exists
scarcely a house to-day that, if called
on at any one moment to pay all its outstanding
debts, could do so. But when
the majority of houses are conducted on
principles that on a limited capital base
a business involving an outlay of perhaps
twenty times its amount, we must
be prepared for these periodical disasters.
The evil is that this essentially dishonest
system has become the only recognized
style of conducting business in these
days; so that commerce has come to be
a game of speculation, where the cleverest
and most daring rogue generally
wins&mdash;a game fostered by the excessive
issue of paper money.</p>

<p>Among events that attracted some attention
during the year was the still lingering
trial of the Tichborne claimant,
which was not thrown into the shade by
the trial of Marshal Bazaine. There have
been meetings of the internationalists and
other societies. New York was entertained
or bored, as may be, for a week, by
a meeting of Protestant gentlemen, mostly
clericals, of all shades of belief, who called
themselves an Evangelical Alliance.
They were not quite agreed as to the
particular object of their meeting, from
which nothing resulted.</p>

<p>Several Catholic nations and numerous
dioceses have been solemnly dedicated to
the Sacred Heart of Our Lord Jesus Christ
during the past year, the province of
New York among the number, on the feast
of the Immaculate Conception, December
8. Dr. Corrigan was consecrated Bishop
of Newark, and F. Gross of Savannah.</p>

<p>The last point has come: the mention
of the dead. The Emperor Napoleon was
the first of note to go; his empire went
with him, for from first to last it was essentially
a personal government. As his will,
drawn up in his still palmy days, said,
"Power is a heavy burden." He forced
himself upon a nation of 30,000,000 of
human souls; he voluntarily assumed
the responsibility of the absolute guidance
of that mighty multitude. He never
had a fixed principle to guide him. He
never dared honestly say, "This is right,"
"This is wrong." The power which he
voluntarily assumed and kept to himself
so long&mdash;one solitary man the ruler of
30,000,000&mdash;ended in disaster for that
mighty multitude and himself.</p>

<p>This death dwarfs all the others. Nevertheless,
many a man was laid in his grave
last year whose name will live after him.
The church has lost Mgr. Losanna,
Bishop of Biela, the oldest Italian bishop;
F. de Smet, the apostolic missionary
among the Indians; and here, in New
York, Vicar-General Starrs. Literature
has suffered in Manzoni, whose death the
Italians rightly viewed as a national calamity.
Edward Bulwer, Lord Lytton, a
man of many and great gifts, has at last
gone to tell "what could he do with them."
History will not soon find again an Amedée
Thierry. Col. James F. Meline, a
frequent and very able contributor to
<span class="smcap">The Catholic World</span>, is a loss to American
Catholic literature. The Anglican
Bishop of Winchester, a gifted orator, but
a churchman of no very fixed opinions,
was killed by a fall from his horse. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span>
the same day died Lord Westbury, a man
of a singularly acute and powerful intellect,
who has left his mark on English
legislation. Our Chief-Justice Chase is
gone, and it will be difficult to find his
equal. Rattazzi, the Italian minister, is
gone to his place. John Stuart Mill, who
could not well be dismissed in a sentence,
is dead. He was a singular mixture of
philosophical acumen and practical stupidity.
Art has lost Landseer; science,
Maury and Liebig, the chemist; while
medicine laments Nelaton. The American,
French, and English stage mourns
respectively Forrest and Macready, the
once rival tragedians, and Lafont, a prince
of comedians. Royalty has lost the Empress
Dowager of Austria, a very holy
woman; the Empress Dowager of Brazil;
the King of Saxony, a scholar and a Christian,
and the Duke of Brunswick, who
was famed for anything but holiness.
General Paez, who once was famous, is
dead. The death of Captain Hall adds
another to the list of brave, adventurous
spirits who so far have wasted their lives
in the endeavor to discover the North
Pole. His death involved the failure of
the <em>Polaris</em> expedition, which was fitted
out by the American government. The
story of the rescue of the <em>Polaris</em> crew
belongs to the romance of history.</p>

<p>Bernstorff and Olozaga, the ambassadors
respectively of Germany and Spain,
have dropped from diplomatic circles into
that circle where the finest diplomacy
cannot cover the slightest delinquency.</p>

<p>There is little to add. Another year has
happily passed over our heads without a
serious war, but the future threatens to
make ample and speedy atonement for
this lamentable deficiency. Last year
<span class="smcap">The Catholic World</span> closed its review
by saying that "Europe was arming."
This year it may say Europe is armed.
Prussia, Russia, France, Austria, Italy&mdash;what
are they? Nations of warriors.
Had the Persian king asked the meaning
of these armed nations, he would
probably have been answered, with a grim
jocularity, that civilized powers found
such the only method of keeping the
peace and preserving that imaginary
thing&mdash;equilibrium. The Russian expedition
into and capture of Khiva, the defeat
of the Dutch by the Atchinese in the
Island of Sumatra, the English war with
Ashantee, make the three ruptures of international
peace during the year. England
seems particularly choice in her selection
of foes: Abyssinia, the Looshai
tribes, and now&mdash;Ashantee. She is jealous
of her turbulent neighbors, and must
vindicate her ancient prestige.</p>

<p>The main events which have moved
the world during the past year have now
been touched upon hastily and crudely
enough, but sufficiently, it may be hoped,
to give the reader some idea of the mainsprings
which move this busy world, of
which we form a part, and in which each
one is set to play a part and render an
account of it. What was said at the beginning
may be more readily appreciated
now, or denied&mdash;that the year of our Lord
1873 is bigger with portent than event,
and a portent that bodes ill, as far as human
eye can see, for the church of
Christ, built upon Peter. Mr. Disraeli's
party-cry may contain more truth than
the crier, wise man though he be,
dreamed: there is such an intense, bitter,
determined, and general hostility, on
the part of "the kings and the princes of
the world, against the Lord and against
his Christ"; the opposition is fast becoming
so intolerant and absolutely unbearable
to Catholics; while protest and
opposition in words alone seem vain and
idle when addressed to ears that are
deaf.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, Catholics must not
budge an inch. They are not only fighting
for their religion, but for human freedom.
To yield the smallest point of principle
is to be false to their conscience.
The more persistent is the non-Catholic
world in false theories of human rights
and human wrongs, the more persistent
must they be in adhering, at any sacrifice,
to what they know to be right, and what
was right when modern nations were
unborn. Catholics must remember that
all are fighting the same battle, and all
are bound to take a hand in the struggle.
What the Pope fights for, that all
Catholics fight for&mdash;from the bishop to
the priest, from the priest to the one
whose voice is heard in the halls of legislation,
to the editor in his office, to the
merchant in his counting-house, to the
very beggar in the street. There is no
difference, no line to be drawn. We must
be one, and, if right must win, then victory
is ours.</p>

<p>For, for what do we contend? To be
Christian; to be free to obey the church
which our Lord Jesus Christ founded.
Allegiance to a foreign power? What
folly! Allegiance to Pius IX. is alle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span>giance
to Jesus Christ. Nothing more,
nothing less. Are Catholics not Americans,
or Germans, or Irishmen, or Englishmen,
for being Catholics? How, when,
where, was it ever shown that they were
not? Why, when Protestantism was not
known, were Catholics not nationalists&mdash;when
Christendom was one?</p>

<p>A new year is opening before us&mdash;a
year of trial, not so much in this country,
but to the universal church. Where
freedom is left to Catholics, as in this
country, they must never cease, by prayer,
by the pen, by the voice, by every
means that the occasion calls forth, to
help their persecuted brethren; not looking
to this government or to that to help
them, but basing their cause on their natural
rights. There is not a civil, religious,
or political right anywhere existing
on this earth, belonging to non-Catholics,
which does not also belong to
Catholics. They must get that idea fast
in their minds, and fight on that which is
a lawful and just issue. No Protestant
can claim a right which does not belong
equally to a Catholic. No Protestant, be
he individual or government, can say to
a Catholic: You must not believe this
doctrine or that; you must not take the
Pope for an infallible guide in religion,
but yourself; you must not educate your
children in your religion, and so on.
This is the language, open or secret, of
the day which is addressed to Catholics.
It must be met with no hesitation, but
with the response: Our freedom is your
freedom; our rights are your rights; our
interest is your interest; nay, after all,
our God is your God. Let us fight our
battles of opinion civilly. But when you
issue paper constitutions every day, and
tell us that we must obey such and such
an iniquitous law&mdash;a law revolting to our
conscience, our reason, and every aspiration
of freedom&mdash;we throw your paper
constitution to the winds, and refuse to
obey it. <em>It is necessary to obey God rather
than man!</em> We conclude by wishing to all
our readers a happy New Year, to our
Holy Father a speedy triumph, and to
ourselves the pleasure of recording, at
the end of 1874, the history of the confusion
and rout of the enemies of the
church.</p>

<p>Of events accidentally omitted in the
preceding record of the year, were the
ravages of the yellow fever in the South,
particularly at Memphis and Shreveport,
where many Catholic priests and
religious sacrificed their lives in the
service of the sick. To the list of disasters
at sea resulting from carelessness
must be added the recent wreck of the
<em>Ville du Havre</em>, with a loss of upwards of
200 lives. The festival of the Catholic
Union at Boston also deserved mention,
as it evoked a demonstration of
Catholic strength and Catholic feeling
that was an honest source of pride.
Among names omitted in the death-roll
were those of Dr. H. S. Hewit, a noble
man who sacrificed much for his country
and his faith; Hiram Powers, the sculptor;
Laura Keene, the actress, an estimable
woman and a good Catholic;
Sir Henry Holland, Henry W. Wilberforce,
brother of the Anglican bishop,
and for a long time editor of the London
<cite>Weekly Register</cite> (Catholic); General Hardee,
and a name once very famous, Abdel-Kader.
A new Atlantic cable was
this year laid by the <em>Great Eastern</em> between
Valentia and Heart's Content, N. F.</p>

<p>A very timely book, whose publication
is very welcome. It is one of a class very
numerous at present in France, which we
hope to see becoming common in our own
country. That is to say, it treats of the
horrible consequences in the social order
flowing from the prevalent infidel, heretical,
anti-Catholic theories, maxims, errors,
and illusions of the age, vamped up
by sophists and charlatans, and palmed
off upon their dupes and victims as philosophy,
science, advanced ideas, principles
of progress and improvement in civilization.
It treats also of Catholic principles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span>
as the principles of true social and political
order and well-being. It is lively
and brilliant, and we recommend it most
earnestly as a book most useful and entertaining,
specially fitted to counteract
the false notions which are but too current
even among Catholics.</p>

<p>Here is quite a supply of works of
fiction by Catholic writers to help while
away the dreary winter months. <cite>Lascine</cite>
is a story whose incidents are taken from
the experience of an Oxford convert. A
number of very good stories of this kind
have appeared since the great movement
began; and the movement itself,
besides its serious importance, is certainly
very fertile in romantic incidents,
and furnishes abundant stuff for a skilful
novelist. <cite>Lascine</cite> is a book which can be
read with great interest, and is by no
means lacking in cleverness. Its principal
fault is an excess of sentimentality.
We think it promises a great deal for the
future success of its young author.</p>

<p>Anything written by Lady Georgiana
Fullerton must of course be excellent.
The first and last of these stories are particularly
good, and the last one ought to
be read by all our young people, especially
young ladies who aspire to become
literary stars.</p>

<p><cite>Marie and Paul</cite> is a very pretty and
pathetic tale.</p>

<p><cite>The Baron of Hertz</cite> has a great deal of
historical instruction about the crimes
and horrors of the German Reformation,
couched in the form of a stirring and
most tragic story.</p>

<p>Miss White's <em>début</em> is very creditable
to her. She has originality of conception
and power of delineation and description.
There are certain inaccuracies
in respect to the English titles of nobility,
and some other minor faults of style
which indicate the need of a more careful
attention to details and a more accurate
revision. As a whole, the story is a
very successful effort.</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><span class="smcap">The Real Presence.</span> By Rev. P. Tissot,
S.J. New York: P. O'Shea.
1873.</p></div>

<p>An excellent little book, solid, simple,
and pious, good alike for old and young.
The doctrinal gravity of the treatise is
relieved in an agreeable and edifying
manner by some interesting narrations of
miraculous events relating to the Blessed
Eucharist. F. Tissot has chosen these
incidents with great judgment, selecting
those which are both extremely wonderful
and at the same time very well authenticated,
and taking care to give the
proof as well as the history. There cannot
be anything more stupid or more provoking
than the ignorant, supercilious,
and flippant manner in which the writers
for the secular and <em>soi-disant</em> religious
press, sneer at these Catholic miracles,
without pretending to reason about the
evidence on which the truth rests. There
are some who think it the best policy to
keep silent about them; but it is our opinion
that we ought to bring them constantly
before the face and eyes of the unbelieving
world, although the light which
flashes from them may be disagreeable to
many who do not wish to be disturbed in
their fatal slumber.</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><span class="smcap">Saxe Holm's Stories.</span> New York: Scribner.
1874.</p></div>

<p>A most peculiar school of fiction,
which we may call the "transcendental,"
has grown up among the New Englanders
and their <em>semblables</em> within our own
remembrance. Some of its productions
are of fine quality, and it oscillates in
morality between the two extremes of
Catholicity and pantheism. Nevertheless,
as a dear friend, who lived and died a
Unitarian minister, once remarked to us,
the prevailing tendency of this entire
transcendental movement is a very circuitous
return to the religion of our Catholic
forefathers. The stories of this volume,
written, we conjecture, by a lady,
are a sample of the kind of literature referred
to. The first story, "Draxy Mil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span>ler,"
is a <i lang="fr">chef d'œuvre</i>. It may seem odd
that we should perceive a Catholic undertone
in a story the heroine of which,
after marrying a minister in a wild country
hamlet of New Hampshire, takes
charge of the preaching for a year after
her husband's death. Female preaching,
and the whole set of strong-minded
female notions, we abominate, of course.
But Draxy Miller's last epoch of life, as
the passing <em>umbra</em> of her husband, is so
described that the repulsive aspect of the
pastoral office in petticoats is hidden.
And as an ideal character Draxy is exquisite.
"Reuben Miller's Daughter"
wins the heart of the reader, as she did the
hearts of the old captain, the stage-driver,
the elder, and the elder's parishioners.</p>

<p>"The One-Legged Dancers" is capital
also, and the other stories are written
with skill and effect. There is rather too
strong an infusion of transcendental notions
about love, yet the moral tone is
much higher than is usually found in
novels, and the author appears to recognize
the stringent obligation of wedlock.
We rank this volume of stories decidedly
in the first class.</p>

<p>In the advertisements at the end of the
volume we perceive the announcement
of a translation of Jules Verne's <cite>De la
Terre à la Lune</cite>, together with another
similar book, describing a journey to the
centre of the earth. The first of these
extraordinary <i lang="fr">jeux d'esprit</i> has given us so
much pleasure in the original, overflowing,
as it is, with humor, poetry, and
scientific knowledge, that we call the attention
of our readers, in a spirit of purely
disinterested philanthropy, to the fact
that they can get this book and its fellow
in English. They will help very
materially the effort to pass a merry
Christmas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Arena and the Throne.</span> By L. T.
Townsend, D.D., author of <cite>Credo</cite>, etc.
Boston: Lee &amp; Shepard. 1873.</p></div>

<p>The principal object of this book is
one in which we heartily sympathize,
being the refutation of the ordinary shallow
arguments which some persons consider
as conclusive in favor of what is
known as the "plurality of worlds" and
the maintenance of the dignity of man as
a worthy possessor of the universe of
God. The material universe is insignificant
compared with a single soul. We
need not take so much pains to try to
utilize it. The convenience of one man
would be a sufficient reason for its existence.
The physical arguments, drawn
from actual observation, in favor of the
uninhabitability of the worlds with which
we have become in any degree acquainted,
are well put.</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><span class="smcap">Rhoda Thornton's Girlhood.</span> By
Mary E. Pratt. Boston: Lee &amp; Shepard.
1873.</p></div>

<p>A pretty, simple story of New England
life; a good book for a school prize.
The usual hearty country pleasures&mdash;husking
and quilting parties, Thanksgiving,
etc., are well and truly described;
a healthy tone runs through the story,
which is a natural and probable one.
The little heroine, Rhoda, a thoughtful,
womanly child, begins her life in an
alms-house, and then spends a few years
on an old-fashioned farm. She turns out
to be the great-granddaughter of a lost
member of an old family, whose heirs
and representatives she and her brother
become. The incidents are not violently
improbable, and the disintegration naturally
arising in such a family through
imprudent marriages and removals to
distant and unreclaimed territories very
adequately accounts for the mystery.
The style is free and simple; studied
ornament or any silly rhetorical flourish
is avoided.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Acts of the Early Martyrs.</span> By
J. A. M. Fastré, S.J. Third series.
Philadelphia: P. Cunningham &amp; Son.
1873.</p></div>

<p>The first and second series of this valuable
and suggestive work have received
due notice in these pages at the time of
their publication. We have before us
now the third series, chiefly treating of
the martyrs of the IVth century, under
the tenth general persecution&mdash;that of
Diocletian. The contents are most interesting,
the more so as some of the saints
here mentioned are less known than
those whose acts filled the first two volumes.
The great and foremost reason
why we rejoice to see the sufferings and
constancy of the early martyrs brought
before the remembrance of our people is
that these sufferings have some analogy
with the present condition of the church
in many lands. Although the physical tortures
of early days are out of fashion, the
moral persecution is not less ingeniously
spread over the whole life of a Catholic
than it was in former times. The same
kind of constancy is required to conquer
the latter as was needed by the martyrs
to overcome bodily pain. In those early
times social ostracism, exile from honorable
professions, and confiscation of property,
were as frequently as now the
guerdon of him who embraced the unpopular
religion, as we see in the case
of S. Tarachus and his companions. In
every instance the bribe held out by
Satan to the confessors of the faith was
the favor of the emperor, the honors and
emoluments of the magistracy, great
riches, and high position, as we see specially
in the case of S. Clement of Ancyra.
His is the most wonderful life recounted
in this little book. Eighteen
years of incessant martyrdom; the most
heroic constancy and patience; the most
singular and miraculous Providence
watching over him; the powers of persuasion
which converted his jailers, his executioners,
and thousands of pagans in
the various places where he was tortured
and confined; the manner in which it
pleased God to make him whole no less
than six times after the devil had done
his best to render his body unrecognizable&mdash;all
contribute to make of his life a
tissue of a more wonderful and awful romance
than any imaginary tale of mediæval
marvel. To S. Blasius of Sebaste
we would also call attention, as having
forestalled S. Francis of Assisi in his
god-given power over the lower creation.
In the story of S. Polyeuctus the reader
will recognize the foundation of Corneille's
sublime Christian drama of
<cite>Polyeucte</cite>, written at the instance of Mme.
de Maintenon. The style of this book
is flowing and correct; simple, as befits
the subject, which cannot be raised higher
by any flight of human fancy or adornment
of human fashion; is accessible to
the understanding of the unlearned, and
cannot fail involuntarily to touch the
hearts of all. Is it not a strange thought
to dwell upon, that, among all the conversions
wrought on the spot by the supernatural
courage of the martyrs, there
should be hardly one instance on record
of it having converted their judge?
The sudden judgment executed on some
governors and prætors is indeed mentioned
in a few cases. Are we to suppose
that they were really beyond persuasion,
being possessed by a devil who
had complete control over their faculties?
It is a very awful thing whereon
to meditate, but these stories of our forerunners
in the good fight certainly
strongly suggest the idea.</p>

<h3>THE PRINCIPLES OF REAL BEING.</h3>


<h4>II.<br />

EXTRINSIC PRINCIPLES OF BEING.</h4>

<p>As in chemistry, so also in metaphysics,
the labor and difficulty attending
the analysis of complex
things is proportional to the degree
of their complexity. Hence in the
search after the principles of real
being, which we are about to make,
we judge it expedient, for the greater
convenience and satisfaction of our
philosophical readers, to start from
the principles of the most simple
among the subjects of metaphysical
analysis&mdash;that is, from the principles
of primitive beings.</p>

<p>By "primitive" being we mean a
being not made up of other beings,
but "strictly one in its entity"&mdash;<i lang="la">unum
per se in ratione entis</i>&mdash;and therefore
having nothing of which it can be
deprived without ceasing to be altogether.</p>

<p>It is to be observed that a primitive
being may be conceived to exist
either contingently or through the
necessity of its own nature. Of
course, a being which exists through
the necessity of its own nature is
perfectly independent of all extrinsic
things, as it contains in its own nature
the adequate reason of its being,
and therefore admits of no extrinsic
principles of any kind. But a being
which exists contingently is a being
which has not within itself the adequate
reason of its existence; whence
it follows that its existence cannot
be accounted for but by recourse
to some extrinsic principle or principles.
As the knowledge of extrinsic
principles is calculated to throw
much light also on the intrinsic constitution
of primitive contingent beings,
let us make such principles the
subject of our first investigation.</p>

<p>We affirm that the extrinsic principles
of every primitive contingent
being are three; for to the question,
"Whence any such being proceeds,"
three different answers can
be given, and three only.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span></p>
<p>First, we can assign the reason
why, or the end <em>for the sake of which</em>,
a being has been made to exist.</p>

<p>Secondly, we can point out the
agency <em>through which</em> a being has
been made to exist.</p>

<p>Thirdly, and lastly, we can mention
the term <em>out of which</em> a being
has been brought into existence.</p>

<p>These three principles virtually
contain the whole theory of creation.
If we were now writing for unbelievers,
we would be obliged to commence
by establishing some preliminary
truths, such as God's existence,
the contingency of the world,
and the philosophical impossibility
of accounting for its origin without
recourse to the dogma of creation.
But as our habitual readers are presumed
to be sufficiently instructed
about these fundamental truths, we
think we may here dispense with a
direct demonstration of the same,
and avoid a digression which would
lead us too far from the subject now
under examination. As, however,
this article may possibly fall into the
hands of some dupe of modern infidelity,
we propose to make a few
incidental remarks on their usual objections,
and to lay down, before we
conclude, some of the arguments by
which unbelievers can be convinced
of the absolute truth of what we now
assume as the ground of our explanations.</p>

<p>We assume, then, that there is a
Creator, a God, a being infinitely
intelligent and infinitely powerful,
eternal, and independent. Such a
being, as infinitely perfect, is infinitely
happy, and experiences no need
whatever of anything outside of himself.
He therefore does not create
anything, unless he freely wills; nor
wills he anything, unless it is for
some good which he freely intends;
for nothing but good can be the object
of volition. Now, the only good
which God in his infinite wisdom can
freely intend is the exterior manifestation
of his divine perfections. It
is, therefore, for this end that creatures
were brought into existence.</p>

<p>Our first answer to the question
above proposed points out this <em>final
principle</em> of creation&mdash;that is, the
manifestation of God's perfections in
such a degree and manner as he himself
was pleased freely to determine.
To attain this end, it is obvious that
God was obliged to bestow upon his
creatures such a degree of reality as
would enable them to show in themselves
and in their finite perfections
a finite image, and, so to say, a reflex
of the perfections of their Creator.
Hence the final principle, on
which the existence of contingent
beings originally depends, comprises
not only the manifestation of God's
perfections in a determinate degree,
but also, and more immediately, the
bestowal of a proportionate degree
of entity upon creatures, that they
may carry on such a manifestation
according to the design of their Creator.
Thus the <em>ultimate</em> end of creation
is indeed God's glory, or the
manifestation of his perfections; but
the <em>proximate</em> end of creation, and
that which is immediately obtained
in the very act of creation, is the existence
of the created things with
that degree of reality and with those
endowments which make them fit
instruments for the aforesaid manifestation.
Accordingly, when asked
whence a primitive contingent being
proceeds, our first answer must be
that it proceeds from God's design
of showing his existence and infinite
perfection by communicating contingent
existence and finite perfections
outside of himself.</p>

<p>Let us here take notice that
"modern thought" ignores final principles
altogether, and pretends that
arguments from design have no value<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span>
in science. In this pretension we
unmistakably recognize the materialistic
propensities and the lack of philosophical
reasoning by which our
age is afflicted. When our modern
sages will prove that creation
does not proceed from a will, or that
a will can act without an object, then
they will be entitled to the honor of
a serious refutation. As it is, their
negative position is sufficiently refuted
by a simple appeal to common
sense.</p>

<p>To those who, without denying
final causes, maintain that we cannot
ascertain them, nor make them an
object of science, we reply that,
although we do not know <em>all</em> the
particular ends which each creature
may be destined to fulfil, we nevertheless
know perfectly well the general
end of creation. Now, nothing
more is needed for establishing the
reality of the first extrinsic principle
on which the existence of every contingent
being depends.</p>

<p>Our second answer points out the
<em>efficient principle</em> of creation&mdash;that is,
God's omnipotent power. Rationalists
and materialists have tried to
do away with this most necessary
principle. Besides the old pagan
assumption of self-existent matter,
which many of them adopted in order
to supersede the necessity of a creator,
they have tried to popularize
other inventions of more recent thinkers,
who for the God of the Bible
have substituted what they style the
<em>Absolute</em>, and pretend that what we
call "contingent beings" are mere
apparitions of the <em>Absolute</em>&mdash;that is,
the <em>Absolute</em> manifesting itself. Without
stopping here to refute such
a strange theory, we shall content
ourselves with observing that what
is altogether <em>absolute</em> is intrinsically
<em>unmodifiable</em>&mdash;a truth which needs
no demonstration, as it immediately
results from the comparison
of the two terms; whence it
follows that, if the <em>Absolute</em> wishes to
manifest itself, it cannot do so by assuming
any new form, but only by
means of something extraneous to
its own nature, and consequently
through the instrumentality of some
being <em>produced</em> by it, perfectly <em>distinct</em>
from it, and which may admit of
such modifications as we witness
everywhere around us, and as we
know to be irreconcilable with the
nature of the <em>Absolute</em>. This suffices
to show that no apparition or manifestation
of the <em>Absolute</em> can be conceived
without implying an exertion
of efficient power.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> We say, then,
in our second answer, that it is
through divine omnipotence that contingent
beings were actually brought
into existence by such a communication
of reality as was proportionate
to the design of their Creator. In
other terms, God's omnipotent power
is the <em>efficient</em> principle of all primitive
contingent being.</p>

<p>Our third answer points out the
<i lang="la">terminus ex quo</i> of creation&mdash;that is,
the term out of which every contingent
being is primarily educed.
Such a term is mere nothingness; for
whatever primarily begins to exist
must come out of absolute non-existence.
It is against this that our
modern pseudo-philosophers most
loudly protest, as they stoutly proclaim
that "nothing comes out of
nothing"&mdash;<i lang="la">ex nihilo nihil fit</i>. We
may well smile at their useless protestation;
for the fact is that nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span>
is ever brought into existence but
from its contrary&mdash;that is, from its
non-existence. It would be vain to
object that, to build a house or a
ship, materials are needed. Of
course they are needed, but a house
is a compound, not a primitive, being;
and to build a house is not <em>to produce</em>
the house, but only to effect <em>the artistic
arrangement</em> of its materials.
Now, undoubtedly, before the house
is built, such an arrangement has no
existence. The only thing, therefore,
that the builder efficiently produces
springs out of non-existence. We fully
admit that a physical compound cannot
be made up without materials&mdash;viz.,
without pre-existent components&mdash;but,
to be sure, the first components
do not themselves depend on other
components, because the first components
are <em>primitive</em> beings, and, as
such, cannot be made of any pre-existing
material. Yet they must have
been made, since they exist and are
contingent; and, if made of no pre-existing
material, certainly brought
out of nothing.</p>

<p>But as our readers need none of
our arguments to be convinced of a
truth of which they are already in
possession, we will set aside all further
discussion on this subject, and conclude,
from the preceding remarks,
that when we are asked whence a
contingent being originally comes, our
last answer must be that it comes out
of nothing as the <em>term</em> of its eduction.
Nothingness, in this case, holds the
place of the <em>material</em> principle, which
is wanting.</p>

<p>It is clear, then, that all primitive
contingent beings can, and must, be
traced to three extrinsic principles.
This doctrine contains nothing difficult,
far-fetched, or mysterious, and
its great simplicity proves that metaphysics,
after all, may be less frightfully
abstruse than some people are
apt to believe. This same doctrine
is also the universal doctrine of all
philosophers who did not lose themselves
in the dreams of visionary
systems. It is true that they do not
always mention, as formally as we do,
the final object of creation as a distinct
principle; but they do not deny
it. In treating of the origin of things,
they usually consider the final and
the efficient principle of creation as a
single adequate principle, on the
ground that finality and efficiency,
viewed absolutely as they are in God,
are but one and the same thing.
They also omit very frequently the
mention of the term out of which
things are educed, not because they
do not acknowledge it, but because
they know that it has no positive
causality. Nevertheless, a little reflection
will show that such a course
is not the best calculated to give a
distinct idea of the principiation of
things; on the contrary, the very
nature of the metaphysical process
demands that each of the three extrinsic
principles be kept in view
very distinctly and explicitly.</p>

<p>We admit, of course, that the final
and the efficient principle of creation,
viewed absolutely as they are in God,
are really and entitatively the same
thing; but we consider that the intention,
or volition of the end, has
its connection with created beings,
not on account of its absolute entity,
which is necessary, but on account
of its extrinsic termination, which is
contingent; for, evidently, no act
can be conceived as the principle of
a being, except inasmuch as it is connected
with the same being. Accordingly,
God's volition is the principle
of things, not inasmuch as it is
an absolute act, entitatively necessary,
but inasmuch as it is an act having
a contingent termination. On
the other hand, God's infinite power
must indeed be conceived as connoting
an infinity of beings that <em>can</em> be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span>
created, but is not conceivable as
connoting determinate beings that
<em>will</em> be created, unless something be
found that connects it especially with
the same determinate beings. Now,
what is it that connects God's omnipotence
with any determinate being
which is to be created but his volition
of a contingent determinate object&mdash;that
is, his volition as having a
contingent termination? Omnipotence,
therefore, acquires a special
connection with a determinate contingent
being only on account of the
extrinsic termination of divine volition;
and thus divine omnipotence
and divine volition have, under this
consideration, a kind of relative opposition,
on account of which the
one that induces the special connection
is to be distinguished from the
other that acquires it.</p>

<p>Moreover, in the investigation of
first principles we must continue our
analysis as far as we can&mdash;that is, until
we reach the ultimate terms into
which the subject of our investigation
can be resolved. Now, it is evident
that omnipotence, as freely connected
with the production of a determinate
being, is not the ultimate term
of analysis; for we can go further,
and assign the reason of that free
connection&mdash;viz., the actual volition
of an end. Hence the final and the
efficient principle of creation, though
not really distinct in God, afford a
real ground for two distinct concepts,
and are to be considered as two distinct
extrinsic principles with respect
to all created things.</p>

<p>The third extrinsic principle&mdash;that
is, the term out of which contingent
beings are originally educed&mdash;is very
frequently overlooked as irrelevant,
because it has no reality. We are
of opinion that it should be kept in
view by all means, and prominently
too, for many reasons which will be
hereafter explained, and especially
for the easier refutation of pantheism.
Such a term has, indeed, no reality;
but it is not necessary that all the
extrinsic principles of being should be
realities. Common sense teaches, on
the contrary, that when a thing is to
be first brought into existence, it is
necessary that it should pass from its
non-being into being; whence it is
manifest that <em>its non-being</em> is the
proper term out of which it has to
be educed. Now, the non-being of
a thing is its nothingness; and, therefore,
its nothingness is the proper
term out of which it must be educed.
For the same reason, the schoolmen
uniformly taught with Aristotle
that <em>privation</em> also was to be ranked
among the principles of things, although
privations are not positive
beings;<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> and therefore the nothingness
of the term from which creatures
are educed is no objection to
its being placed among the extrinsic
principles of contingent beings.</p>

<p>As, however, that which is looked
upon as a principle is always conceived
to connote the thing principiated, and,
on the other hand, <em>absolute</em> nothingness
has no such connotation (for
connotation is virtual relativity, and
cannot spring from nothing), it follows
that <em>nothingness</em>, when conceived
as a term out of which a
being is educed, is to be looked upon,
not as an absolute negation of being,
but as <em>a negation out of which divine
omnipotence, by the production of an act,
brings the creature into being</em>. In
other terms, nothingness is to be
considered, under God's hand, as <em>a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span>
negative potency of something real</em>,
which can be actuated; and, with
regard to any individual reality, as
the potency of that individual reality.
When viewed in this manner, nothingness
assumes a relative aspect,
in opposition to that reality of which
it is the potency, and thus becomes
apt to connote that same reality, in
the same way as silence connotes
talk, darkness light, absence presence,
informity form. Hence we
took care to say that a thing is
brought into being out of <em>its</em> non-being;
because, as the fool only by
divesting himself of <em>his</em> foolishness
can grow wise, so a reality which is
to come out of nothing&mdash;say, a point
of matter&mdash;cannot be educed out of
the non-being of an angel or of any
other thing, but only out of <em>its own</em>
non-being. Consequently, non-being,
or nothingness, as the term out of
which a point of matter is to be
educed, means nothing but <em>the potency
of that real point</em>; and thus nothingness,
under the hand of the Omnipotent,
acquires, in regard to that
which is educed out of it, that relativity
which is sufficient to make it
a principle, according to the nature
and manner of its principiation.</p>

<p>Some may ask why, among the
extrinsic principles of things, we did
not mention God's <em>archetypal ideas</em>;
for it seems that, when we are
asked whence a contingent being
primarily proceeds, we might answer
by pointing out God's ideas as the
patterns to which creatures must
conform, and by saying that things
primarily proceed <em>from the divine
ideas</em> as from their archetypal principle;
and if this answer&mdash;which is by
no means absurd&mdash;be admitted, the
extrinsic principles of contingent beings
will be four, and not three.</p>

<p>But it is to be observed that God's
ideas precede all decrees concerning
creation, and are the archetypes not
only of all the things that are created,
but of all the things also which
will never be created; and, therefore,
God's ideas have, of themselves, no
connection with the <em>existence</em> of contingent
beings, but only with their
<em>intelligibility</em>. Hence we may argue
in the following manner: The extrinsic
principiation of a contingent
being cannot be traced back to any
<em>special</em> principle prior to that which
is the first reason of their creation.
But God's ideas are prior to God's
volition, which is the first reason of
creation; therefore, the principiation
of contingent beings cannot be traced
back to divine ideas as a <em>special</em>
extrinsic principle.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, since God cannot
intend to create anything but according
to his own idea of it, we must
own that the divine ideas share in
the causality of things, inasmuch
as such ideas are implied in the
volition of producing the objects
they represent; and though, of themselves,
they are not a distinct and
special principle of creation, yet, as
included in the Creator's volition,
they make up the whole plan of creation,
and thus they have a bearing
on the nature, number, and order of
all created things.</p>

<p>Such is the doctrine which we find
in S. Thomas' <cite>Theological Summa</cite>,
where he explains how God's ideas
are the cause of things. "God's
ideas," says he, "are to all created
things what the artist's ideas are to
the works of art. The artist's ideas
are the cause of a work of art, inasmuch
as the artist acts through his
understanding; hence the form or
idea which is in his understanding
must be the principle of his operation,
in the same manner as heat is
the principle of the heating. But it
must be remarked that a natural
form is a principle of operation, not
inasmuch as it is the permanent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span>
form of the thing to which it gives
existence, but inasmuch as it has a
leaning towards an effect. And in a
similar manner the form which is in
the understanding is a principle of
action, not inasmuch as it is in
the understanding simply, but inasmuch
as it acquires, through the will,
a leaning towards an effect; for an
intellectual form is not more connected
with the existence than with the
non-existence of the thing of which
it is the form (since one and the
same is the science of contraries);
and, therefore, such a form cannot
produce a determinate effect, unless
it be brought into connection with
one of the two contraries; which is
done by the will. Now, God, as we
know, causes all things through his
understanding, for his understanding
is his being; and, therefore, his
science, <em>as united with his will</em>, must
be the cause of all things."<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>It might be here objected that if,
for the reason just alleged, archetypal
ideas are not to be considered a distinct
principle of creation, then neither
can omnipotence be considered
as a distinct principle; for as archetypal
ideas do not principiate anything
unless through free volition, so,
also, omnipotence principiates nothing
but in consequence of the same volition;
and, therefore, if archetypal
ideas on this account are not a distinct
principle of things, on the same
account omnipotence cannot be taken
as a distinct principle.</p>

<p>To this we answer that the assumed
parity has no legs to stand on.
That archetypal ideas are not a distinct
principle of creation was proved
above, not simply by arguing that they
cannot principiate anything independently
of free volition, but by showing
that it is not from them, but from the
volition alone, that the real principiation
of things begins. Now, this proof
applies to ideas, but not to omnipotence.
In fact, ideas, even in God,
must be conceived as having a certain
priority with respect to volitions; for
it is true, even in God, that nothing
is willed which is not foreknown&mdash;<i lang="la">nihil
est volitum, quin præcognitum</i>.
If, therefore, God's ideas were a <em>distinct</em>
principle of creation, there would
be something in God, prior to his will,
which would entail the existence of
created beings; which is impossible
to admit so long as we maintain that
God's will must remain free in its extrinsic
operations. We cannot, therefore,
admit, without absurdity, that
the archetypal ideas constitute a <em>distinct</em>
principle of things. But, as to
divine omnipotence, no such absurdity
is to be feared; for God's omnipotence
has no priority with respect
to God's will; and thus the above
argument cannot be used to prove
that omnipotence is not a distinct
principle of creation.</p>

<p>We conclude that the extrinsic
principles, to which the first origin of
contingent beings is to be traced, are
not fewer, and not more, than three.
Our Catholic readers will be satisfied,
we hope, that this conclusion has been
fairly established on what they know
to be secure foundations. Infidels,
of course, will object; for they will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span>
think that the whole of our discussion
has been based on hypothetical
grounds. In fact, we have supposed
that there are "primitive" beings,
that they are "contingent," that they
need "a creator," and that the creator
must be an "infinite being," a god.
If a Comtist or a materialist happens
to read the preceding pages, he will
surely say that we have built nothing
but a cob-house. But we do not care
much what may be objected by such
a class of frivolous and unreasonable
philosophers. We know that their
favorite theories have been a hundred
times exploded, and their futile objections
a hundred times answered.
When a foe is defeated, what is the
use of prolonging the contest? And
when noonday light is dazzling the
world, what need is there of lighting
candles? Let them, therefore,
only open their eyes, if they really
want light. There is no scarcity of
good philosophical works, which, if
consulted by them in a spirit of candor,
will afford them all the light that
a man can reasonably desire for the
full attainment of truth.</p>

<p>Yet the solidity of the ground on
which we have taken our stand may
be established in a very few words.</p>

<p>That there are <em>contingent</em> beings is
quite certain; for nothing which necessarily
exists is liable to change or
modification. But all that surrounds
us in this world is liable to change and
modification; therefore, nothing that
surrounds us in this world necessarily
exists. Accordingly, all that we see
in this world exists contingently.</p>

<p>That contingent beings are either
<em>primitive</em> or made up of <em>primitive</em>
beings is, again, a well-known fact;
for all being which is not primitive
is a compound, and can be traced to
its first physical components&mdash;that is,
to the first elements of its composition.
But the <em>first</em> elements of composition
cannot possibly be made up
of other elements, and accordingly
must be primitive beings. Therefore,
primitive beings exist everywhere,
at least (if nowhere else) in
all the compounds of which they are
the first physical components.</p>

<p>That every primitive contingent
being must have had its <em>origin from
without</em> is a plain truth; for that
which has no origin from without
must have the adequate reason of its
existence from within; and, therefore,
it carries in its essence the necessity
of its existence. But evidently contingent
and changeable beings do not
carry within their essence the necessity
of their existence; therefore, contingent
beings must have had their
origin from without.</p>

<p>That every such being must have
come <em>out of nothing</em> is not less evident;
for a primitive being cannot possibly
come out of pre-existent beings as its
material principles. It must, therefore,
be <em>produced</em> either out of God's
substance or out of nothing. But
not out of God's substance, for divine
substance is not susceptible of
contingent forms; therefore, out of
nothing&mdash;that is, by creation properly.</p>

<p>Lastly, that the Creator is <em>an eternal,
infinite being</em> can be easily proved,
independently of many other arguments,
by the following general theorem,
to which modern philosophers
are invited to pay close attention.
The theorem is this: <em>All efficient cause
is infinitely more perfect, and of an infinitely
better nature, than any of its
effects</em>. If this proposition be true, it
immediately follows that the Creator
of the universe is infinitely more perfect
than the whole universe, and has
a nature infinitely better, nobler, and
higher than that of any contingent
being, and therefore is a necessary
and independent being, the supreme
being&mdash;God. Let us, then, demonstrate
our theorem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a known and incontrovertible
truth that every efficient cause eminently
contains in itself (that is, possesses
in an eminent degree) all the
perfection which it can efficiently
communicate to any number of effects;
and it can be proved, moreover,
that the efficiency of a cause is
never exhausted, and not even weakened,
by its exertions, however long
continued and indefinitely multiplied.
The earth, after having for centuries
exerted its attractive power and
caused the fall of innumerable bodies,
has preserved to this day the same
power whole and undiminished, and
is still acting, with its primitive energy,
on any number of bodies, just as it
did at the time of its creation. Our
soul is not exhausted or weakened
by its operations; but, after having
made any number of judgments,
reasonings, or any other mental actions,
still retains the whole energy
and perfection of its faculties without
waste, effeteness, or decay. A
molecule of oxygen, after having for
ages, either free in the air or confined
in water or in other compounds,
produced such a number of effects as
bewilders and beats all power of imagination,
retains yet its efficient causality
as entire and unimpaired as if it
were of quite recent creation. These
facts show that the efficient cause
suffers no loss whatever by the exertion
of its power, and therefore is
fully equal to the production of an
endless multitude of effects.</p>

<p>Some may say that this conclusion
cannot be universal, as we see that
natural forces are very often exhausted
by exertion. We answer that,
when <em>natural forces</em> are said to be
exhausted, the <em>efficient powers</em> from
which those forces result remain as
intact and as active as before. We
say, indeed, that a man or a horse
is exhausted by fatigue; that our
brain, after hours of mental work, needs
rest to recover its lost energy, and
many other such things; but, in all
such cases, what we call <em>exhaustion</em>
is not a diminution of efficient power
in the agents from the concurrence
of which the natural forces result,
but either the actual disappearance
(by respiration, perspiration, etc.)
of a number of those agents, or a
perturbance of the arrangements and
conditions necessary for their united
conspiration towards the production
of a determinate effect. <em>Natural
force</em>, in the sense of the objection,
is a combination of agents and of
efficient powers, which produce their
effect by many concurrent actions
giving a different resultant under different
conditions; and as any given
effect proximately depends on the
resultant of such actions, the same
powers, though unaltered in themselves,
must, under different conditions,
give rise to different effects.
Take a car and four horses. If the
horses act all in the same direction,
the car will move easily enough; but
if two of the horses act in one direction,
and two in the other, the result
will be very different. Yet the powers
applied to the car are in both
cases the same. Again, take an army
of fifty thousand men facing the enemy.
If the men are well arranged
so as to present a good line of battle,
the action of the army will be
strong; but if the men are disorderly
scattered, the action will be weak,
though the men are the same and
their powers and exertions undiminished.
Now, all bodies and all complex
causes are in the same case;
which is evident from the fact that
with all of them a favorable change
of conditions, all other things remaining
the same, is always attended by
an increase of the effect. Therefore,
the so-called <em>exhaustion</em> of natural
forces is not a diminution of the
efficient powers of which they are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span>
result, but a state of things in which
<em>the same</em> active powers are exerted in
a different manner, or have to perform
a different work, according to the
different conditions to which they
are actually subjected. We therefore
repeat that efficient causes suffer
no loss whatever by the exertion
of their efficient powers, and that
consequently they are fully equal to
the production of an infinite multitude
of effects; and since every efficient
cause, as we have premised,
must contain within itself, in an
eminent manner, the whole perfection
which it can communicate to its
effects, we are forced to conclude
that the nature of every efficient
cause <em>infinitely transcends</em> in perfection
the nature of its effects.</p>

<p>The theorem could be further confirmed
by considering that all the
acts produced by efficient causes of
the natural order, either spiritual or
material, are mere accidents, whereas
the causes themselves are substances;
and it is manifest that the nature
of substance infinitely transcends
the nature of accident.</p>

<p>It might be confirmed, again, by
another very simple consideration.
The efficient cause does not communicate
any portion of itself to
its effect.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> In fact, efficient causation
is production; and production is
not a transfusion, translocation, or
emanation of a pre-existing thing, but
the origination of a <em>new</em> entity which
had no previous formal existence. It
follows that the efficient cause, while
producing an effect, retains its <em>entire</em>
entity, and therefore is never exhausted.
Thus a syllogism is not a portion
of the mind that makes it; and
the making of it leaves intact the
substance and the faculty from which
it proceeds. Thus, also, the actual
momentum of a falling body is not a
portion of the terrestrial power by
which it is produced; the power remains
whole and undiminished in
the substance of the earth, as already
remarked, always ready to produce
any number of changes, and always
unchanged in itself. This is the reason
why every efficient cause infinitely
transcends the nature of its effects.</p>

<p>Our theorem is, then, demonstrated
both by facts and by intrinsic reasons.
We are confident that all honest
philosophers, no matter how much
their intellectual vision may have
been distorted by false doctrines, will
see their way to the right conclusion,
and confess the absolute necessity
of an independent, self-existent, infinite
Creator, from whom all beauty,
goodness, and perfection proceed,
and to whom all creatures&mdash;philosophers
not excepted&mdash;owe allegiance,
honor, and glory.</p>

cylindrical wax, not inasmuch as it is cylindrical,
but inasmuch as it is non-spherical. Such
a non-sphericity is a <em>privation</em>, which is more
than a <em>negation</em>, as it implies not only the absence
of sphericity, but also the presence of its

<h3>THE EPIPHANY.</h3>


<p>Let us, then, also follow the Magi;
let us separate ourselves from our
barbarian customs, and make our
distance therefrom great, that we may
see Christ, since they too, had they
not been far from their own country,
would have missed seeing him.
Let us depart from the things of
earth. For so the wise men, while they
were in Persia, saw but the star; but
after they had departed from Persia,
they beheld the Sun of Righteousness.
Or rather, they would not have seen
so much as the star, unless they had
readily risen up from thence. Let
us, then, also rise up; though all men
be troubled, let us run to the house
of the young Child; though kings,
though nations, though tyrants, interrupt
this our path, let not our desire
pass away; for so shall we
thoroughly repel all the dangers that
beset us; since these too, except
they had seen the young Child,
would not have escaped their danger
from the king. Before seeing the young
Child, fears and dangers and troubles
pressed upon them from every side;
but after the adoration, it is calm and
security; and no longer a star, but an
angel, receives them, having become
priests from the act of adoration; for
we see that they offered gifts also.</p>

<p>Do thou, therefore, likewise leave
the Jewish people, the troubled city,
the blood-thirsty tyrant, the pomps
of the world, and hasten to Bethlehem,
where is the house of the Spiritual
Bread;<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> for though thou be a
shepherd, and come hither, thou wilt
behold the young Child in an inn;
though thou be a king, and approach
not here, thy purple robe will profit
thee nothing; though thou be one of
the wise men, this will be no hindrance
to thee; only let thy coming be to
honor and adore, not to spurn, the
Son of God; only do this with trembling
and with joy, for it is possible
for both of these to concur in one.</p>

<p>But take heed that thou be not
like Herod, and say, <em>That I may come
and worship him</em>, and, when thou art
come, be minded to slay him. For
him do they resemble who partake
of the mysteries unworthily; it being
said that such an one <em>shall be guilty
of the Body and Blood of the Lord</em>.
Yes; for they have in themselves the
tyrant who is grieved at Christ's
Kingdom&mdash;him that is more wicked
than Herod of old&mdash;even Mammon.
For he would fain have the dominion,
and sends them that are his own to
worship in appearance, but slaying
while they worship. Let us fear, then,
lest at any time, while we have the
appearance of suppliants and worshippers,
we should indeed show forth
the contrary.&mdash;<em>S. John Chrysostom.</em></p>

<h3>GRAPES AND THORNS.</h3>


<p class="center">BY THE AUTHOR OF "THE HOUSE OF YORKE."</p>

<h4>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

SUMMER FRIENDS.
</h4>

<p>F. Chevreuse did not allow himself
a long indulgence in his own
sorrows. Before half an hour had
elapsed, he was stepping through the
portal of the city jail, all private grief
set aside and lost sight of in the
errand that had brought him.</p>

<p>Sensitive as he was, the gloom and
dampness inseparable from a prison
would have chilled him, but that pity
for him who was suffering from them
so unjustly, as he believed, startled
his heart into intenser action, and
sent an antagonistic glow through
his frame, as though by force of love
alone he would have warmed the
stones and chased away those depressing
shadows.</p>

<p>A few swift steps along the stone
corridor brought him to the cell
assigned to Mr. Schöninger. Looking
with eagerness, yet shrinkingly too,
through the grating, while the jailer
unlocked the door, he saw the prisoner
standing there with folded arms
and head erect, regarding him coldly
and without the faintest sign of recognition.
The place was not so dim
but he must have seen perfectly who
his visitor was; yet a man of stone
could not have stood more unmoved.</p>

<p>The jailer was not long unlocking
the door, yet, brief as the time was,
it sufficed to work a change in the
priest. It was with him as with the
fountain which tosses its warm waters
into a chilly atmosphere: the spray
retains its form, but not its temperature.
"I am shocked at this, Mr.
Schöninger!" he exclaimed, hastening
into the cell. "I will do anything
to relieve you! Only tell me
what to do."</p>

<p>The words, the gesture, the emphasis,
all were as he had meant; but a
something in the whole manner, which
tells when the heart outleaps the
word and the gesture, was lost. It
was possible to think the cordiality of
his address affected.</p>

<p>Mr. Schöninger bowed lowly, without
unfolding his arms or softening
the expression of his face. "I thank
you for your offers of service," he
said; "but they are unnecessary.
I have employed counsel, and what
the law can do for me will be done.
Meantime, it is not for you and me to
clasp hands."</p>

<p>His look conveyed not only pride,
but disdain. He seemed less the
accused than the accuser.</p>

<p>"Whose hand, then, will you
clasp?" the priest exclaimed, impatient
at what seemed to him an unreasonable
scruple. "You are a
stranger here, and can be sure of no
one. I am the very person whose
good-will will be most valuable to
you."</p>

<p>It was only the embarrassment
resulting from an unexpected rebuff
which could have made F. Chevreuse
appeal to the motive of self-interest.
To tell a proud and bitter,
perhaps a guilty, man that he stands
in his own light, is only to make him
blacken yet more his immovable
shadow. But as a man sometimes
relaxes the severity of his manner at
the same time that he increases the
firmness of his resolution, Mr. Schö<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span>ninger
unbent so far as to offer his visitor
a seat.</p>

<p>"Please excuse the roughness," he
said, indicating a rude bench. "The
furniture is not of my choosing." And
seated himself on the bed, there being
no other place.</p>

<p>F. Chevreuse remained standing.
The mocking courtesy was more chilling
than coldness.</p>

<p>"I followed an impulse of kindness
in coming to you," he said,
looking down to hide how much he
was hurt. "I did not stop to ask myself
what was conventional, or wise,
or politic. My heart prompted me to
fly to the rescue, and I took no other
counsel."</p>

<p>There was no reply. Mr. Schöninger's
eyes were fixed with an intent
and searching gaze on the priest,
and a faint color began to creep up
over his cold face. As F. Chevreuse
raised his eyes and met that gaze,
the faint color deepened to a sudden
red; for the priest's glance was dimmed
by tears of wounded feeling he
had striven to hide.</p>

<p>"You distrust me!" he said reproachfully;
"and I do not deserve
it. I would serve you, if I could.
I would be your friend, if you would
let me."</p>

<p>It was Mr. Schöninger's turn to
drop his eyes. To look in that face
unmoved was impossible. The reproach,
the pain, the tenderness of it
had shot like an arrow through his
heart, steeled as it was. But his
habit of self-control was proof against
surprise. After the blush had left
his face, there was no sign visible of
the struggle that was going on within.
He seemed to be merely considering
a question. After a moment, he
looked up.</p>

<p>"You seem to think me innocent
of this charge?" he remarked calmly.</p>

<p>F. Chevreuse was silent with astonishment.</p>

<p>"You probably do think so," Mr.
Schöninger went on, in the same
tone. "But whatever your opinion
may be, you do not know. Crimes
are committed from various motives
and under various circumstances.
Some are almost accidental. Neither
is crime committed by the low and
rude alone, nor by the bad alone.
There is nothing in the character or
circumstances of any man which
would render it impossible that he
should ever be guilty of a crime. I
repeat, then, that you cannot be sure
of my innocence; and, till it is proved,
there can be no intercourse between
us. I am willing to give you
credit for a charitable impulse; but
I do not want charity. I want justice!"
His eyes flashed out, and his
face began to redden again. Mr.
Schöninger had not become cool by
spending a night in jail.</p>

<p>F. Chevreuse did not stir, though
he was in fact dismissed. Mr. Schöninger,
seeing that his visitor did not
sit, rose, and stood waiting to bow
him out.</p>

<p>"I cannot go away and leave you
so, in such a place!" the priest exclaimed
after a moment, during
which he seemed to have made an
inner effort to go. "It is monstrous!
Cannot you see that it is so? Why,
last night we were like friends; and
I insist that there is no reason why
we should not be friends to-day."</p>

<p>"What! Even if I should be
guilty?" asked the prisoner in a low
voice.</p>

<p>F. Chevreuse made a gesture of
impatience, and was about to utter a
still more impatient protest, when he
met a look so cold, yet so thrilling
with a significance he could not interpret,
that he drew back involuntarily.</p>

<p>The Jew's face darkened. "Your
convictions are, apparently, not so
deep as you had supposed, sir," he
said freezingly. "I am afraid you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</a></span>
would find yourself disappointed as
to the extent of confidence you
would be able to repose in me. The
sober second thought is best. Our
paths are separate."</p>

<p>For the first time something like
anger showed momentarily in the
priest's face, and gave a certain sternness
to the first words he spoke; but
it was over in an instant. "You are
quite right, sir!" he said. "It is impossible
for me to go with you, unless
I am met with entire frankness and
confidence. If you choose that our
paths shall be separate, I will not
force myself on you; but we need
not be antagonistic. Farewell!"</p>

<p>He turned and groped in the door-way
for the passage-step, his own
shadow being added to those which
already wrapped the place in an obscurity
almost like night. He saw
the jailer in the long corridor before
him, waiting to lock the door, and
he had just found where to set his
foot, when he felt a warm touch on
his hand that still held by the stone
door-way inside the cell. The touch
was slight, but it was a caress, either
a kiss or the quick pressure of a soft
palm. He had hardly time to be
fully aware of it before he stood in
the corridor, and the jailer was locking
the door behind him.</p>

<p>He stopped, and looked through
the grating, but could not see the
prisoner. Only a narrow line of
black, like the sleeve of a coat, seemed
to show that Mr. Schöninger had
thrown himself on to his bed. The
priest put his face close to the bars,
and whispered, "God bless you!"</p>

<p>The line of black moved quickly
with a start, but there was no reply.</p>

<p>Pale and dispirited, F. Chevreuse
left the prison, and took his way
slowly to Mrs. Gerald's. He would
rather not have gone then, but he
had promised. He wondered a little
within himself, indeed, why he felt
such reluctance to see persons who
had always been faithful and sympathizing
friends to him, and why he
would rather, were the choice left to
him, have gone to Mrs. Ferrier, or,
still better, to Annette.</p>

<p>As soon as the true reason occurred
to him, he put it aside, and refused
to think on the subject.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gerald was evidently on
the watch for him; for as soon as
he approached the house, she came
to the door to meet him. The color
was wavering in her face, her blue
eyes were suffused with tears, and
looked the sympathy her lips did not
speak. But the sympathy was all
for him&mdash;for the terrible wound torn
open again, for the new wound added,
perhaps, of a misplaced confidence.
No look seemed to glance
past him and inquire for the one he
had left behind.</p>

<p>Honora sat by a fire in the sitting-room,
leaning close to the blaze,
with a shawl drawn about her shoulders,
and seemed to shiver even then.
There was a frosty paleness in her
face as she rose to meet their visitor,
as though the blood had all flowed
back to her heart, and stopped there,
and the hand she gave him was cold.
But an eager, questioning glance
slipped from her eyes, swift and
shrinking, that went beyond him and
asked for news of the prisoner.</p>

<p>"Well," said F. Chevreuse, glancing
from one to the other, "there is
nothing to tell."</p>

<p>Honora sank into her chair again,
and waited mutely, looking into the
fire.</p>

<p>"Nothing of any consequence,
that is," he continued, folding his
hands together on the back of a
chair, and looking down at them.
"I went to the jail; but Mr. Schöninger
has so quixotic a sense of propriety
that he will not allow me to
do anything for him. It was in vain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span>
for me to urge the matter; he absolutely
sent me away."</p>

<p>"He was quite right in that," Mrs.
Gerald remarked coldly.</p>

<p>Honora's eyes were again eagerly
searching the priest's face, but Mrs.
Gerald was in turn looking away
from him.</p>

<p>"And why was he right, madam?"
demanded F. Chevreuse.</p>

<p>She did not look up to answer,
and her expression was of that stubborn
reserve which some good people
assume when they cannot say
anything friendly, and are determined
not to be uncharitable. "I may be
wrong," she said, carefully choosing
her words, "but it does not seem to
me that you are the person of whom
he should take advice now. Pardon
me, F. Chevreuse! I do not mean
to criticise you nor dictate to you,
of course. But I am glad that you
are to have nothing to do with this.
You should be spared the pain."</p>

<p>He was too sore-hearted to argue
the point; and he knew, moreover,
that argument would be thrown
away. He was well aware that the
most of his friends thought his generosity
sometimes exaggerated, and
were more likely to check than to
encourage him. When he went out
of the beaten track, he had never
found sympathy anywhere but with
the one whose loss he felt more
and more every day, unless it might
be with Annette Ferrier and her
mother.</p>

<p>"It seems that I am not to have
anything to do with it," he said;
"though I fail to see why I should
not. Let that pass, however. I
pity the poor fellow from my heart,
though his detention will be a short
one, since the trial, they tell me, is to
come on immediately. It is a miserable
condition, being shut up in that
place, and loaded with such an outrageous
accusation. I do not wonder
it made him bitter and distrustful
of me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gerald lifted her eyes quickly,
and gave F. Chevreuse a glance
that recalled to his mind that look
from which he had shrunk in the
prison. He could not understand
it, but it made him shiver. Not that
it expressed any suspicion or accusation;
it seemed only to ask searchingly
if there were no suspicion in his
own mind.</p>

<p>"Well, good-by!" he said hastily.
"Let us all beware of uncharitableness
in thought, word, and deed."</p>

<p>When he had reached the street-door
he heard Miss Pembroke's
step following him.</p>

<p>"You have really nothing to tell
me?" she asked, trembling as she
held her shawl about her. "Recollect
that I and this man have spoken
together as friends. Am I still to
believe in him?"</p>

<p>"Oh! fie, Honora Pembroke!"
the priest exclaimed sorrowfully.
"Is that the kind of friendship you
give, that you doubt a person at the
first wild charge made against him?"</p>

<p>"It is not so much that I doubt,
father," she said faintly. "But nothing
so terrible has ever come near
me before, and it is confounding. I
want to be reassured."</p>

<p>"Cast all doubt out of your mind,
then," he said emphatically. "And
if you should send some little message
to Mr. Schöninger by a proper
messenger, saying that you hope he
will soon be delivered from his trouble,
it would be a kind and Christian
act."</p>

<p>She drew back a little, and made
no reply.</p>

<p>"You are not willing to do it?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"I would rather not, father," she
answered deprecatingly. "I really
hope and pray that he may soon be
delivered, and I am willing he should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span>
know it&mdash;he must be sure of it, if he
gives the subject a thought&mdash;but I
would not like to send him a message.
There will be men to go and
speak kindly to him; he has many
friends. If Lawrence were here, he
would go. I would not like to take
any step in the matter."</p>

<p>F. Chevreuse sighed. "You must
be guided by your own feeling and
sense of right in this," he said. "I
did not mean to advise, but only to
suggest."</p>

<p>He knew, as he went away, that
she lingered in the door, looking
after him in painful uncertainty, and
he almost expected to hear himself
called back and begged to be her
messenger. But no call came; and
he went away from his second visit,
as from the first, chilled and disappointed.</p>

<p>For one moment the thought which
he had thrust aside on coming started
out again, and made itself felt.
It seemed to him, in that brief glance
at it, that there is nothing on earth
which can be more cruel than a
strict and scrupulous respectability.
Then instantly he began to make excuses,
and to find reasons why people,
women especially, should be less
demonstrative than he might have
wished.</p>

<p>"What! you will not recognize
me?" said a voice at his elbow.</p>

<p>It was a voice to arrest attention&mdash;deep,
musical, and penetrating; and
the speaker was not one to be passed
with only a glance. He was of medium
height, broad-shouldered, and
had an exceedingly handsome face,
with brilliant blue eyes, and wavy,
dark hair just beginning to be threaded
with white. This was F. O'Donovan,
whose parish, a small one, lay
two miles, or more, from that of F.
Chevreuse. Besides these two, there
was no other priest resident within a
radius of forty miles.</p>

<p>"Brother!" exclaimed F. Chevreuse,
and grasped the hand the
other extended to him, and for a moment
seemed to be on the point of
yielding to an emotion natural to one
who, having long borne without human
help his own burdens and the
burdens of others, sees at length a
friend on whom he can lean in turn,
and to whom he can venture to confess
his human weakness. "I thought
you were at home, swathed in flannels,"
he added, recovering himself.</p>

<p>F. O'Donovan shrugged his
shoulders. He had been a good
deal in France, and had, moreover,
as all graceful and vivacious persons
have, a natural inclination to use a
good deal of gesture. "Rheumatism,
my friend, is not invincible.
Yesterday I was helpless; this morning
at seven o'clock I was helpless.
At ten minutes past seven I heard
news which made me wish to see you;
and here I am&mdash;sound, too. It was
only to say, Get thee behind me,
Satan! and I could walk as well as
you. From which I conclude that
my rheumatism, if it had existence
outside my own imagination, was
Satan in disguise."</p>

<p>F. Chevreuse pressed the arm he
had taken, and they walked on together
a little way in silence. The
news his brother priest had heard
need not be spoken of. His silent
sympathy and companionship were
enough.</p>

<p>"Has it ever occurred to you that
the saints must have been considered
in their day rather disreputable
people?" the elder priest asked presently.
"Leaving violent persecution
out of the question, what a raising
of eyebrows, and shrugging of
shoulders, and how many indulgent
smiles, and looks of mild surprise,
and cold surprise, and gentle dismay,
and polite disapprobation, and all
that they must have occasioned!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span></p>

<p>"By which I understand," remarked
the other, "that somebody
has refused to fly in the face of society
at your request."</p>

<p>"Taken with the usual allowance
required by your interpretations of
me, that is true," F. Chevreuse admitted.</p>

<p>His friend smiled. There was always
this little pretence of feud between
them, and each admired the
other heartily, though the Frenchman
was unconventional to a fault, and
the Irishman scrupulously polished.
A fastidious taste and a cautious
self-control, learned in a large and
varied experience of life, stood in
constant ward over F. O'Donovan's
warm heart and high spirit. F.
Chevreuse, in his trustful ardor, was
constantly bruising himself on the
rocks; his friend looked out for and
steered clear of them, yet not with a
selfish nor ungenerous caution.</p>

<p>"Brother Chevreuse," he said in
a voice to which he could impart
an almost irresistible persuasiveness,
"you are older and wiser than I am,
and I only remind you of what you
know when I say that conventionality
is not to be reprobated. It is on
the side of law and order. It is the
friend of propriety and decency. It
is the rule, to which, indeed, exceptions
are allowed, but not too readily.
You speak of the saints as though they
were all persons who have lived before
the world peculiar and exceptional
lives. Of course, even while I
speak, you remember that the church
does not pretend to have canonized
all her holy children, and that she
has appointed a day to commemorate
those who have won the heavenly
crown without drawing upon themselves
the attention of mankind. I
do not believe that any breath of
slander or of injurious criticism ever
touched Our Blessed Lady. She
used every care to preserve herself
from them. Why should not women
be as careful now, even at the risk of
seeming to be selfishly cautious? Is
the high reputation which they have
labored to acquire to be lightly
perilled, even for an apparently good
end? Besides, in performing that
one good act, they may, by drawing
criticism on themselves, have lost the
power to perform another effectually.
You defend an accused person, never
having done so before, and you may
save him. Do it a second time, and
people will say, 'Oh! he is always
defending criminals'; and your power
is gone."</p>

<p>"It is hard to see a person wrongly
accused, and not protest against the
wrong," F. Chevreuse said gravely.</p>

<p>"It is more than hard, it is wicked,"
the other replied with earnestness.
"But first be sure that the
person is innocent; and then, having
ascertained that, try to recollect, my
dear friend, that you alone are not to
right all the wrongs of earth. Some
must be endured, some must be rectified
by others than you. And,
after all, I am inclined to believe
that, as a rule, no innocent person
falls into serious difficulty without
having been faulty in some way, as
regards prudence, at least. Now,
how is such a person to learn wisdom
by experience, if there is always somebody
at his elbow to save him from
the consequences of his own act. It
is not pleasant to be obliged to check
a generous impulse in ourselves or in
others; and it is not pleasant, when
we are in trouble, to be left to fight our
way out of it alone. But if we are always
performing works of supererogation,
we may unfit ourselves for performing
duties. And as to finding our
track, unassisted, through difficult
ways, and learning by sharp experience
how to avoid them, it develops our
inward resources, and is good for us,
though bitter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span></p>

<p>The last words were delivered with
an incisive emphasis so delicate as to
be observable only in one who seldom
spoke with emphasis, and it touched
the listener deeply. F. O'Donovan
never complained, and he had never
made any special revelations to his
friend; but one who knew his life
could not doubt that he had learned
to take his very sleep in armor. He
had risen from poverty and obscurity,
as the sparks rise; had borne the
jealousy of those whom he left behind,
and of those he had eclipsed in
his higher estate; had been obliged
to control in himself a haughty spirit
and a tender heart; yet had never
made a misstep of any consequence,
nor given his most jealous detractor
an angry word to remember.</p>

<p>His place was in a metropolitan
church; but, at his own request, he
had been sent for a time to a quiet
country parish, that he might have
leisure to complete a literary work for
which city life and the demands of a
host of admirers were too distracting.</p>

<p>He had followed F. Chevreuse
from his own house to the prison,
and from the prison to Mrs. Gerald's,
and he understood perfectly what he
would wish to do and where he had
been disappointed. Honora had, indeed,
told him, half weeping, of the
request she had refused, and had proposed
to make him the bearer of her
retraction.</p>

<p>"To think I should have set up
my sense of right against his!" she
exclaimed. "To think that I should
have refused him anything!"</p>

<p>And yet, though she was sincere
in her regret, she was greatly relieved
when F. O'Donovan declined to
carry her message, assuring her that
F. Chevreuse would doubtless, on
second thought, approve of her refusal.
To have sent a direct message
to a man who stood before the world
charged with a horrible crime, and,
perhaps, to have received a message
in return from him&mdash;to have placed
herself thus in communication with
one of the most darkly accused inmates
of that jail which she had passed
frequently during her whole life
without ever dreaming of crossing
the threshold, even for a work of
mercy&mdash;the very possibility plunged
Miss Pembroke into confusion and
distress. The regions of crime were
as far removed from her experience
as the regions that lie outside of
human life; and, of herself, she would
as soon have thought of following
any one to purgatory as to prison.</p>

<p>That scrupulous correctness and
propriety which we admire in these fair
women, whose whole lives are passed
in the delicately screened cloisters of
the world, shows sometimes a reverse
not so admirable. They are seldom
the friends in need; and when a fearless
heroism is wanted, they do not
come forward. They draw back instinctively
those garments they have
been at pains to preserve so white
from contact with the blood-stained,
dusty One who goes staggering by
with the thorns on his head and the
cross on his shoulders. A look of
pity and horror may follow him from
the safe place where they stand; but
it is not they who pierce their way
through the rabble, with Veronica, to
take the imprint of his misery on to
their stainlessness, nor they who weep
around his tomb through dews and
darkness, careless of the world in
their unspeakable sorrow, and floating
above the world in the unspeakable
ecstasy to which that sorrow gives
place. No, the charity of the human
angel is limited. Only the angels of
God, and those generous souls whose
anguish of pity for the suffering is a
constantly purifying fire, can go down
into the darker paths of life and receive
no stain.</p>

<p>"I am glad F. O'Donovan came,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</a></span>
Mrs. Gerald remarked when their
second visitor left them. "I feel
better for being reassured by him.
Of course, we all know that we cannot
throw ourselves away for everybody,
as dear F. Chevreuse's impulse
is; yet he is so good, so much better
than any one else, one feels almost
guilty in not following him every step
he wishes. His utter unselfishness
and generosity are very disturbing to
one sometimes; for we must think of
ourselves."</p>

<p>"It is well for the world that there
are those who see no such necessity,"
Miss Pembroke replied briefly.</p>

<p>Her companion said nothing more
for a moment. She had been conscious
that Honora was not satisfied,
but had preferred to take no notice
of it, and to quiet her without seeming
aware that she needed quieting.</p>

<p>"Poor Mr. Schöninger!" she said
presently. "I pity him with all my
heart. It is, of course, impossible
to believe that this arrest is anything
but a mistake which will soon be
corrected. Still, the affair must be
very painful to him. How indignant
Lawrence will be! I wish he might
hear nothing of it till he comes home,
for I really think he would come
sooner if he knew what has happened.
He thought a good deal of Mr.
Schöninger."</p>

<p>"Yes, it must soon be corrected,"
repeated Honora, passing over the
rest. "I cannot imagine on what
grounds the arrest was made; but
some are ready to believe of a stranger
what they would never listen to
if said of one they knew. One might
parody that proverb about the absent,
and say that the foreigner is
always wrong. Only imagine what
it must be, Mrs. Gerald"&mdash;Honora's
brown eyes dilated with a sort of terror,&mdash;"imagine
what it must be to
find one's self in trouble and disgrace
alone in a foreign land. No
person has any special interest in the
stranger; no one knows him well
enough to defend him; his reputation
is a bubble that the first breath may
break; and if he is wrong, no one
understands what excuses may be
made for him. Fancy Lawrence
alone in some European country,
and arrested for a great crime."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gerald had listened at first
with sympathy; but at the name of
Lawrence her face changed.</p>

<p>"My dear Honora," she said with
decision, "I cannot possibly imagine
my son, no matter how far away,
nor how friendless he might be&mdash;I
cannot imagine him being arrested
on a charge of robbery and murder!
It is too great a flight of fancy, and
too unjust. But that does not prevent
my pitying Mr. Schöninger."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gerald would not have
shown such asperity, probably, had
her son never given people anything
to forgive in him. Tremblingly
alive to his faults, she gladly seized
on any charge which it was possible
to cast indignantly aside.</p>

<p>Honora perceived too well her
feelings and the mistake that she
herself had made to be in the least
annoyed at the reply. It may be
that she understood better than ever
before what might be the pain of
one whose affections are engaged by
an object which has not her entire
approval. Not that she loved Mr.
Schöninger, or for a moment fancied
that she did; it was only that he had
come near enough to excite her imagination
on the subject of love.</p>

<p>"Fortunately," she said, after a
thoughtful pause, "the people of
Crichton are liberal."</p>

<p>It was such an opinion as might
have been expected from her character
and experience. Life had shown
her but little of those deeper causes
which underlie so much of the apparent
inconsistency of mankind. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</a></span>
had not learned to distinguish between
that firm liberality which is
founded on principle, and is but another
name for justice, and its unstable
namesake, which floats on
the surface of a soul that has no
convictions. The former can be relied
on; the latter may at any time
give place to a violent bigotry. It
has an immense vanity beneath, and
fiercely resents on others its own
mistakes.</p>

<p>The gradations of the change
might have been precisely calculated
beforehand. At first, an astonishment
which was unanimous; followed, after
the natural pause, by individual
voices in various tones, the loud ones
harmless, the whispering ones poisonous.
Crichton was a city where
there could be but one sensation at
a time. Whatever of moment happened
there, everybody knew it and
everybody talked about it. The
loud voices grew lower, the whispers
increased. We have heard orchestra
music like that, where, after the first
crash and pause, the instruments
start their several ways, and one
scarcely hears the whisper of violins
that runs through the heavy brass, till
presently that whisper becomes an
audible hiss, then a sharp cry, and
finally its shrieks overtop trumpet
and organ.</p>

<p>People could not imagine on what
grounds Mr. Schöninger had been accused,
but considered it a matter of
course that there must have been
some proof against him; and they
immediately set themselves to recollecting
everything they had observed
in him, to magnifying every peculiarity
and perverting every circumstance
connected with his life. Some
had always said that strangers whom
nobody knew anything about were
received altogether too readily in
Crichton. It was only necessary that
a man should be good-looking, or
clever, or have a romantic appearance,
or be enveloped in a mystery,
for him to be made the hero of the
hour. And here the men bethought
themselves, like true sons of Adam,
to lay the blame on the women.
Another class, made up of both
Catholics and Protestants, reminded
the public that they had from
the first protested against Christians
mingling in friendly intercourse with
Jews. It was a treason against their
Lord to do so, these Christians said,
and he had shown his displeasure by
allowing this wolf, whom they had
admitted into the fold, to destroy one
of the chosen ones. Others there
were, microscopic critics, who had
always found something peculiarly
sinister in certain expressions of the
Jew's face, and who recollected perfectly
having shivered with fear when
they had encountered these peculiar
glances.</p>

<p>The sound grew up and gathered,
and at the end of a fortnight public
opinion in Crichton had half condemned
the man without having
heard a word of testimony against
him.</p>

<p>Doubtless his own scornful silence
had not predisposed any one in his
favor; and, besides, he was reported
to have spoken slightingly of an institution
which it is not safe to attack.
Rumor accused him of having said
that a jury hinder more than they
help the cause of justice; and that if
public sentiment is not high enough
to educate and elect a proper judge,
it is folly to call in from the street to
his aid twelve men who are probably
still more incompetent, and certainly
less responsible.</p>

<p>The judges may have been not ill-pleased
at this; but few others heard
the story without indignation.</p>

<p>The newspapers also soon became
either cold or unfriendly; for though
they had all expressed the most cour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</a></span>teous
surprise and regret at his arrest,
he had not allowed one of their reporters
so much as a glimpse of him.</p>

<p>One after another the friendly
voices grew faint or fell into silence,
till only three or four were left. F.
Chevreuse had written Mr. Schöninger
a line, "Whenever you want me,
I shall be ready to come," and had
refrained from all other approach.
But he did not cease to insist on his
belief in the prisoner's innocence.
Mrs. Ferrier, also, was loud and
warm in her championship. She
visited Mr. Schöninger in prison, and
stood at the grate, the jailer by her
side, with tears running down her
cheeks, while she poured forth her
incoherent but most sincere indignation
and grief; and she scraped the
skin from her fat hand pushing it
through the bars to take that of the
prisoner.</p>

<p>She also made arrangements for a
larger and lighter cell to be given
him, and had begun to furnish it most
luxuriously, when he found out what
she was doing, and absolutely refused
to move.</p>

<p>"My dear Mrs. Ferrier," he said,
"it is not the bare stones and the
hard bench that makes the place intolerable;
and I will not consent to
any change. I should be no more
at ease locked up in a palace. Let
me remain as I am while I stay
here."</p>

<p>"But look at that bed!" she
cried; and the diamond glittering
on the indignant finger she pointed
through the bars was outshone by the
tear that welled up and hung on her
eyelashes. "The idea of a man like
you sleeping on that sack of straw
with a gray blanket over it! It's a
sin and a shame!"</p>

<p>"But, my friend, it is good enough
for a criminal," he answered, with
something like a faint smile on his
face.</p>

<p>"A criminal!" And we hope the
reader will pardon the next two words
uttered by this dear, good soul in the
heat of her generous trust and pity.
She said, "Shut up!"</p>

<p>"I know what nonsense you talked
to F. Chevreuse," she went on;
"but I won't listen to it. You ought
to be ashamed of yourself for driving
that man away. You can't serve me
so. I shall come here, and I shall
take up for you; and&mdash;now, Mr.
Schöninger, don't be silly, but let me
fix up that other room for you. The
sun shines into it all the afternoon;
and I've got a nice carpet on the
floor, and two arm-chairs, and some
wax candles, and a red curtain to
draw over the grating, and I'll make
it as comfortable as if my own son
was going to be in it. Do give your
consent, now!"</p>

<p>Still he was inflexible, though he
softened his refusal with every expression
of gratitude. "There are reasons
why it would be very painful and embarrassing
for me to consent," he
said; "and since your wish is to give
me pleasure, I am sure you will not
urge this when I tell you that I should
be more uncomfortable there than
here. Your kindness does me good;
but I cannot receive your bounty."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ferrier was not to be so
thwarted, however. She had to relinquish
her project of furnishing a
room for him, but she made amends
to herself by supplying his table extravagantly.
It was in vain for him
to protest. The waiter gravely assured
him that the dishes were sent in
from the prison kitchen; the jailer
as gravely added that his wife overlooked
that part of the establishment,
and he knew nothing about it; and
Mrs. Ferrier, when the prisoner
questioned her, declared, with an air
of the utmost innocence, that she did
not send in his food, and did not
know what he had. The truth was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[Pg 601]</a></span>
that she had ordered the keeper of a
restaurant near by to send Mr. Schöninger
the best that he could supply;
and she flattered herself that the
waiter could with truth obey her order
to say that the dishes came from
the jail kitchen. "You're not obliged
to tell him that they come in at
one door of the kitchen and out at
another," she said.</p>

<p>Flowers lined the cell, fruit arrived
there in profusion, and illustrated
papers and books, the text of which
betrayed the simple taste that had
selected them, piled the one table
and filled the window-ledges&mdash;all
sent anonymously. Mr. Schöninger
found himself obliged to capitulate to
this persistent and most transparent
incognita.</p>

<p>In a few weeks another friend,
quite as decided, though less demonstrative,
was added. Lawrence Gerald,
returning with his wife to Crichton,
went immediately to see Mr.
Schöninger and offer any service in
his power to render him.</p>

<p>"It is folly to waste breath in abusing
the detectives or whoever has
made this miserable blunder," he
said calmly. "Of course, nobody is
safe from suspicion. I'm rather surprised
they hadn't hit upon me, for I
was hard up at that time. The point
is, however, can I do anything for
you? You will be out of this soon,
of course; but, in the meantime, I
should be very glad if I can serve
you in any way."</p>

<p>Mr. Schöninger assured his visitor
that he needed no services; but his
manner of declining the assistance
offered him was far more natural and
cheerful than it had been when F.
Chevreuse or Mrs. Ferrier came.
Lawrence Gerald's friendship was, indeed,
of more value to him in this
matter than theirs could have been;
for as Lawrence was a man of the
world, and not too likely to have
much faith in any one, men of the
world would respect his opinion,
white they might laugh at the championship
of a woman and look upon
the ideal charity of a priest as a feeling
which they could not be expected
to sympathize with nor be influenced
by.</p>

<p>This friendly act of Lawrence's
greatly pleased his mother-in-law;
and, since Annette looked quite contented
and happy, she was still more
disposed to be complacent toward
the young man.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have believed he
thought so much of Annette," she
said confidentially to F. Chevreuse.
"But he follows her about like her
shadow. It's all the time, 'Ask
Annette,' or, 'What does Annette
say?' or, 'How will Annette like it?'
and he will hardly go down-town
unless she goes with him. I only
hope it may last," sighed the mother,
fearful of being too sanguine.</p>

<p>It was quite true that Lawrence
Gerald showed far more affection for
his wife after than he ever had before
their marriage, and Mrs. Ferrier
scarcely exaggerated in saying that
he followed her about like her
shadow. He perceived more and
more every day how strong and reliable
she was, and how full of resources
for every emergency. Besides,
he had a cause for gratitude
toward her of which her mother was
not aware. During that time when
they had been alone, undisturbed by
discordant interruptions, undisturbed
also by any excessive happiness in
each other's society, she had perceived
that something more than indifference
to herself preyed upon his
spirits, and had at length succeeded
in drawing from him a confession of
his difficulties. He owned that the
story her mother had heard of his
debts was true, and that he had been
able to silence his persecutors only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span>
for a short time. On the very day
of his marriage one of them had demanded
payment, and a second letter
had followed him to their bridal retreat.</p>

<p>"My dear Lawrence, why did you
not tell me at once?" his wife interrupted
as soon as she caught the
purport of his stammering explanation.
"It was not treating me with
confidence; and surely I deserve your
confidence."</p>

<p>"It isn't pleasant for a man to
own that he has been a fool, and
a liar besides," he replied bitterly.
"You know I denied it to your
mother. I couldn't very well tell her
that it was none of her business,
though I wanted to."</p>

<p>"It isn't pleasant for any one to
own that he has failed to live quite
up to his own idea of what is right,"
she said quickly. "I often blush at
the recollection of some mistake or
folly in my life. But where one understands
you, Lawrence, and is
bound to you for life, for better or
for worse, you should not be too reserved.
All that I have is yours. My
first wish is to spare you pain, and I
could have no greater pleasure than
to have you confide in me. Do not
be afraid of hearing any lectures or
of seeing me assume the right to
criticise you. I only ask to help you
when I can."</p>

<p>This had been said with a haste
that gave him no time to interpose
or reply; and before the last words
were well spoken she had left his
side, and was opening a little writing-desk
in another part of the room.
Her husband leaned on the window-ledge
and looked out, appearing to
regard intently the mist that hung
over the unseen cataract before him,
and to listen to the soft thunder of
its fall; but the color of his face,
burning with a mortification inseparable
from such an avowal as he had
made, and the faint lines of a frown
that seemed to be graven between
his brows, showed that his mind was
far from being occupied with the
beauties of nature. The only thought
Niagara suggested to him at that
moment escaped his lips in a whisper
as he leaned out into the air: "If
my foot had but slipped a little further
to-day!"</p>

<p>Annette came back and leaned out
beside him. "How soft and sunny
the air is for September!" she said.
"It is more like June."</p>

<p>He felt her small hand slip under
his arm, and push a roll of paper into
his breast-pocket while she spoke.</p>

<p>"Do you not think, husband,"
she went on, "that we might like to
go to Montreal instead of South?
It would be pleasanter to go to
Washington during the season."</p>

<p>And that was all that was said
about the matter, except that, the
day after their return to Crichton,
Lawrence told his wife that the debt
was paid.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes," she said lightly, as if
such a debt were quite a matter of
course. "I'm glad that is off your
mind." And would have changed the
subject.</p>

<p>But he, looking at her very gravely,
knew well that the lightness was
assumed to spare him, and that the
affair was only less painful to her
than to himself.</p>

<p>They were in their own sitting-room,
and Annette was filling a vase
with late flowers that she had just
brought in from the garden, while
he sat near the table by which she
stood. He stretched his hand and
drew her to him, holding her slender
fingers that held a cluster of heart's-ease
she had just taken from the
basket.</p>

<p>"Let me speak of it once more,
Ninon," he said. "You did not exact
any promise from me, dear; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</a></span>
I have one to make you. If my
word or my will are good for anything,
I will never again play a game
for pleasure even, still less for money.
I have no temptation to now; and
if I had, the recollection of what
play has cost me would be enough
to save me from yielding."</p>

<p>His face and voice said more than
the words, and the regret, the shame,
and the gratitude they expressed
were almost more than she could
bear. It hurt her cruelly to see him
whom she had exalted as an idol so
humbled and sorrowful before her.
He looked weary; she had thought
that for some time; and though the
outlines of his beautiful face were too
delicate to show readily a loss of flesh,
she could see that he had grown perceptibly
thinner.</p>

<p>"I was sure of you, without needing
any promise," she said, and tried
to smile on him, but with tremulous
lips. "And now, do not let it trouble
your mind any longer. I'm going
to give you a charm." She smiled
brightly this time, for he had kissed
her hand. "With this magical
flower I bar all unrest from you, and
assure you peace for the future."</p>

<p>She fastened the cluster of heart's-ease
in his button-hole, then returned
to her flowers.</p>

<p>Her husband could not but remember
the time when a tender
word or act of his would bring the
blush to her face and set her in a
tremor of delight. He would sometimes
have been a little more demonstrative
and affectionate, if the effect
had not been so annoyingly great on
her. But now, without the slightest
appearance of coldness or anger, in
simple unconsciousness, it seemed,
of having changed her manner, she
was altogether changed. She received
him kindly, there was no sign of
an estranged heart, but she only received;
she did not invite, nor follow,
nor linger about him. Quite naturally
and calmly she attended to
whatever employment she might
have in hand when he was present;
and though she undeniably liked to
have him near her, it was possible
for her to forget his presence for a
moment. Looking at her now, as
she began quietly arranging her
flowers again, the thought glimmered
dimly in his mind that Honora Pembroke
herself could not have behaved
with a sweeter or more dignified
tranquillity. But the moment of this
consciousness was brief. Honora's
image had too long been enthroned
by him as queen in all things womanly
to be disturbed by this slight figure
with her glow-worm lamp.</p>

<p>Still, the development of his wife's
character made its impression on him;
and, half needing her, and half curious
about her, he felt himself constantly
attracted to her society.</p>

<p>They passed a good deal of time
alone together, sometimes walking or
driving in the pleasant autumn days,
sometimes shut up in their own room,
where Annette read, sang to, and
otherwise amused her husband. He
was going into business; but the two
or three months of necessary preparation
and delay were to him very much
leisure time, and hung rather heavily
on his hands.</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to get to work,"
he said to her. "Idleness is tolerable
only in a pleasant atmosphere; and
the atmosphere of Crichton is anything
but pleasant now. Sometimes
I've half a mind to run away till this
ridiculous trial is over and people
can talk of something else."</p>

<p>"The same thought has occurred
to me," his wife replied. "I am
growing nervous and low-spirited with
these horrible images constantly before
my mind. I have begged mamma
not to mention the subject again
at the table, nor anywhere else with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</a></span>out
necessity. Some people&mdash;I don't
mean mamma, of course&mdash;but some
people seem to enjoy tragedies, and
to be quite angry if one doesn't put
the most terrible construction on
every circumstance. I have no patience
with them."</p>

<p>She looked, indeed, quite pale and
irritated. Like all persons of a lively
imagination, she was nearly as much
affected by the description of a scene
as she would have been on witnessing
it; and the frequent repetitions and
amplifications with which others of
duller natures had found it necessary
to revive their own impressions had
been both painful and annoying to
her. Besides, she had a source of
disquiet which she confided to no
one, not even to F. Chevreuse, since
she never alluded to his mother's
death when in conversation with him.
While wondering, in spite of herself,
what proof sufficient to justify an
indictment could have been found
against Mr. Schöninger, she had recollected
the shawl he left in her garden
the night Mother Chevreuse was
killed. It did not seem an important
circumstance; yet it constantly recurred
to her in connection with other
points not so trivial. She did not for
a moment believe him guilty; but
her imagination, seizing on this one
fact, held it up suggestively, so that
it cast on her mind various and
troublesome shadows that were out
of all proportion to itself. Why had
he appeared startled when she mentioned
the shawl to him? And could
it be possible he was sincere in saying
that he came for it in the morning,
when she had plainly seen some
one remove it at night? She combated
these disagreeable thoughts
with all her strength, and sought to
atone to Mr. Schöninger for the wrong
she believed they did him by entering
heartily into all her mother's plans
for his comfort; but she could not
banish them so entirely but they tormented
her into wishing to fly to some
place where she might at least hope
to forget the whole subject.</p>

<p>"If every one were like Mrs.
Gerald and Honora," she said to her
mother, "how much smoother and
deeper life would be! I am sure they
think of dear Mother Chevreuse very
often, and always with bleeding
hearts; yet they never speak of her,
except, in a pleasant way, to recall
some saying or some kind act of hers;
and one would not know, from what
they say, that she had not been assumed
bodily into heaven, or, at
least, died tranquilly and beautifully
of old age. I have no sympathy,
mamma, with these noisy people who
come here wringing their hands and
uttering maledictions on Mr. Schöninger."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ferrier felt a little touched at
that part of the speech which referred
to the wringing of hands, for that was
her most frequent manner of expressing
distress of mind, and she was not
sure that her daughter did not mean
to give her an indirect reproof or
warning. Her reply, therefore, was
a dissenting one; and the comparison
she used, though not elegant,
was somewhat strong.</p>

<p>"It's all the same difference as
there is between a wild horse and a
horse that's broke," she said. "And
you can't deny that the creature loses
half its spirit before it bears the
bit and the rein. And so I believe
that your fine, quiet people kill some
of the life out of their grief when they
teach it to be so polite, and that they
forget the friend they have lost while
they are thinking how they shall behave
themselves and cry in a genteel
manner. When I die, Annette,
may the Lord give me just such
mourners as Mother Chevreuse has
in those poor people!"</p>

<p>"Oh! don't, mamma!" the daugh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[Pg 605]</a></span>ter
said coaxingly; for Mrs. Ferrier
had ended by bursting into tears.
"I didn't mean to vex you, only I
am nervous and distressed by all
this excitement. There! don't cry
any more, and I will own that you
are at least half right."</p>

<p>"Not but that they do provoke
me when they talk about Mr. Schöninger,"
Mrs. Ferrier admitted, wiping
her eyes. "But then, the poor
things! it's a relief to their sorrow to
be mad with somebody about it."</p>

<p>It was undeniable that whatever
relief could be found in lamentation
for their dear lost friend, and in invoking
retribution on her destroyer,
very few hesitated to avail themselves
of. Besides what the law could do,
it needed all the influence that F.
Chevreuse had, both with his own
flock and with non-Catholics, to prevent
the people who were constantly
gathering outside the jail from
throwing missiles into Mr. Schöninger's
cell.</p>

<p>"How strong is accusation!" he
exclaimed. "People appear to think
that man condemned already, though
he is sure to be triumphantly acquitted.
It is astonishing how entirely
a grave charge, no matter how
unproved, removes those we have
loved and respected beyond the pale
of our sympathy. It is as though
we had never heard of innocence being
accused, and believed it impossible
that we could ever be calumniated
ourselves."</p>

<p>He was speaking to Mr. Sales, the
editor of <cite>The Aurora</cite>, who received
his remarks rather uneasily. <cite>The
Aurora</cite> had of late been interesting itself
very much in the history of the
Jews, both ancient and modern, the
items it scattered through its columns
with apparent carelessness not being
always calculated to inspire the reader
with an increased affection for that
ancient race; and "Fleur de Lis" had
every week, from her corner on the
first page, bewailed in facile and
dolorous lines the sorrows and sufferings
of that Mother and Son to
whom, in the prose of everyday life,
she was far from conspicuous for devotion.</p>

<p>"I have observed, sir," Mr. Sales
said, feeling obliged to say something,
"that people who have the reputation
of being the most correct and irreproachable
are often the most unmerciful
toward wrong-doers. It gives
one an unpleasant impression of religion."</p>

<p>"Not justly," the priest replied.
"What you say of some good people
is quite true&mdash;they are moral skeletons
since, after all, good principles
are only the vertebræ of a character.
But there are many charitable Christians
in the world. I find fault with
their imaginations chiefly; they cannot
fancy themselves accused without
being guilty."</p>

<p>And thus, in the midst of an increasing
excitement, Mr. Schöninger's trial
came on.</p>

<h3>SPIRITUALISM.</h3>


<h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

<p>The spiritualists who protest
against the attribution of spiritualistic
phenomena to the devil may be
divided into two classes: 1st, Those
who believe there is no such being
as the devil; 2d, Those who, believing
him to exist, think it unreasonable to
attribute such phenomena as those
under consideration to such a being.</p>

<p>To these first I can but admit that
there is no demonstrating the devil;
but, on the other hand, I would remind
them that, in denying his existence,
they are opposing themselves,
1st, to the religious instinct of the
great mass of mankind, who are persuaded
that life is a warfare, that
there is an enemy. 2d, To the unwavering,
explicit tradition of the
Christian church. It is impossible
to read the Gospels and the other
records of the early church without
having the idea of a battle, and
an enemy against whom it is waged,
brought prominently before you.
Our Lord came to break the power
of Satan, and to take away "the armor
in which he trusted"; and the
church was instituted for his detailed
discomfiture. Every soul that is
saved is regarded as a spoil snatched
from the hand of the enemy; every
one who is cast out of the church is
delivered over to Satan.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest words of the
church's ritual are words of defiance
and adjuration of the enemy upon
whom it was her mission to trample.
Her exorcisms, for instance, in the
baptism service testify to a consciousness
of the devil's presence which is
simply startling in its realism. He
is never forgotten from the moment
when, gently breathing on the child's
face, she charges the unclean spirit
to give place to the Holy Ghost, to
the moment when he is cast out headlong,
followed by the renunciations
of his rescued victim.</p>

<p>The extreme antiquity of these exorcisms
is sufficiently vindicated by
the poetic paraphrase of Prudentius
in the IVth century:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Intonat antistes Domini: fuge callide serpens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mancipium Christi, fur corruptissime vexas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Desine, Christus adest humani corporis ultor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Non licet ut spolium rapias cui Christus inhœsit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pulsus abi ventose liquor Christus jubet, exi.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Moreover, though the devil is expelled
in baptism, the church never
lets her children lose sight of him.
She is ever warning them in the words
of S. Augustine: "Take care, afflicted
mortals, take care that the evil one
defile not ever this house of the
body; that, introduced by the senses,
he debauch not the soul's sanctity,
nor cloud the intellectual light. This
evil thing winds through all the inlets
of the senses, moulds itself in
forms, blends with colors, weds with
sounds, lurks in anger and guileful
speech, clothes itself in scents, transfuses
itself in savors, and by a flood
of troublous movement obscures
the mind with evil desires, and fills
with vapor the channels of the understanding,
through which the soul's
ray might shed the light of reason."<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
Voltaire was quite in the right when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</a></span>he set down a priest who would fain
compromise with infidelity by throwing
up the devil, in this wise: "Belief
in the devil is an essential point of
Christianity: no Satan, no Saviour."</p>

<p>Those who, admitting the devil to
exist, deny that spiritualistic phenomena
are diabolical, urge various
pleas which I purpose to examine in
detail. They insist upon, 1st, the innocent
and friendly character of the
phenomena. 2d, The difficulty of believing
that the devil would be allowed
to take so great a liberty with respectable
persons without some sort
of understanding on their parts. 3d,
The fact that spiritualism is a great
and most efficient exponent of the
immortality of the soul and the existence
of God in a materialistic generation.</p>

<p>Now, as regards the first plea, I
simply deny the fact of the innocence.
I submit that pantheism and the
non-existence of eternal punishment
are immoral doctrines, the spread
of which is calculated to make the
world worse; and that these are pre-eminently
the doctrines of spiritualism,
taught always indirectly, and
standing out more and more clearly
in proportion as the pious twaddle in
which they are incorporated for the
sake of weak brethren is laid aside,
and the spiritualistic element can give
itself free way.</p>

<p>Demoralizing, also, is the distaste
which spiritualism creates for all
religion, inasmuch as religion lives
by faith. An example of this is given
in <cite>Experiences with D. D. Home</cite>,
p. 60. The party of spiritualists had
been conversing, as they imagined,
with the spirit of the child of one of
them, lately dead, the body, in its
coffin, being in the room in which
they were sitting. After the burial,
we are told, "On our way home, every
one remarked that the burial-service,
which is, in general, so impressive,
had that day, while in church, sounded
strangely flat and unprofitable.
Mrs. Cox asked how it was that the
clergyman had not used the words,
'dust to dust, ashes to ashes, earth to
earth.' We assured her that he had;
but she declared she had not heard
them, although standing as near to
him as any of us."</p>

<p>In other respects spiritualism is by
no means innocent. It is impossible
to set aside the strong testimony, not
merely of medical men, who might
be supposed prejudiced, but of so
many who have either practised spiritualism
themselves, or had spiritualist
friends, as to the gradual exhaustion
of the vital powers which it
produces when persevered in to any
extent. And, again, it is by far the
most efficacious destructive of the
barriers of propriety, particularly between
the sexes. No one can read
much even of the most respectable
séances without feeling that the
worthy persons who take part in
them, whilst securing, may be, the
perfect propriety of the particular
séance in which they are engaged,
are lending the cloak of their respectability
to an institution especially
marked out for the dissemination of
corruption. My contention is that
the devil has in spiritualism the prospect
of an excellent harvest of evil,
of which he has received a very sufficient
earnest.</p>

<p>With regard to the gentle behavior,
which is supposed to be inconsistent
with the character of one
who is spoken of as "a roaring lion,"
I would observe that this gentleness
on the part of the spirits is by no
means invariable; see the violent
scene (<cite>Experiences</cite>, p. 154) in which
Home is tormented and screams; or,
again, where the company is struck
by the "disagreeable and fearful
glowing" of his eyes (<cite>Rep.</cite>, p. 208).
However, it must be confessed that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</a></span>
general character of the manifestations
is gentleness itself; but of this sort of
gentleness there are plenty of examples
in accounts of mediæval magic,
when spirits have persevered for a
considerable time in gentle, not to
say pious, behavior, and, indeed,
only came out as devils when worried
by the church. The following is
taken from the <cite>Gloria Posthuma S.
Ignatii</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>A little girl of nine, the daughter
of an artilleryman at Malta, was
made quite a pet of by spirits, who
were always bringing her little presents
of jewelry and fruit, at one time
giving her fresh figs in January. She
was frightened just at first; but they
talked so charmingly of their being
creatures of the good God as well as
she, and seemed to know so much
about the inside of churches, that
the child could not but think well of
them. They did her a wonderful
number of kind services of various
sorts. For a long time the child's
parents, who never saw the spirits,
but only the effects they produced,
acquiesced, and seemed to think it
rather a good joke. There was only
one thing that troubled them, and
which ultimately made them call in
the priest, and this was that the spirits,
who showed themselves amiably
enough disposed towards the family
in general, had an exceptional spite
against one little boy. They never
saw him come into the room without
showing disgust and saying all sorts
of unpleasant things about him to
their little <em>protégée</em>. There was
nothing peculiar about the boy, except
that he served Mass every morning.
When the priest was sent for,
and the house exorcised, the amiable
spirits, as is invariably the case under
these circumstances, lost their temper,
and went off in ugly shapes, vomiting
fire; in fact, to borrow the
spiritualist expression, showing themselves
very unformed spirits indeed.</p>

<p>With this account we may compare
Mr. Fusedale's extraordinary
letter (<cite>Rep.</cite>, p. 255), in which he says
that the spirits habitually play with
his children and amuse them by
showing them pretty scenes in a
polished globe. He tells us that he
has himself seen one of these scenes&mdash;a
ship hemmed in by ice in an Arctic
sea&mdash;and that he has often witnessed
his little boy shoved across the room
in a chair, his legs being too short to
reach the ground, and "no human
agency near." The two accounts
are not unlike, except that in the second
story the materials for playing
out the last scene are wanting.</p>

<p>As regards the second plea, no
doubt there is something odd, at first
sight, in so many respectable persons
having got into such intimate relations
with the devil without knowing
anything about it; and though there
are not wanting individual instances
in the history of <em>diablerie</em>, I must
confess that I have met with nothing
of the sort on so large a scale. But
then, we must remember that there
never has been a time when respectables
as a body were so irreligious,
and it is religion that is the great obstacle
to such unconscious intercourse
with Satan. No Christian who
knows anything of the way in which
the ancient world was exorcised need
be surprised at the devil's being able
considerably to enlarge his sphere, as
the church has been compelled to
narrow hers.</p>

<p>At first, indeed, it seemed as if this
was not to be the case. The philosophy
of the last century boasted, with
some plausibility, that it had done
what the church, with all her exorcisms,
had never succeeded in doing&mdash;that
it had swept away Satan altogether,
along with his great adversary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[Pg 609]</a></span>
Church and devil had gone down together;
and for a time people persuaded
themselves that the devil, anyhow,
had gone. In the solemn obsequies
of the whole caste of superstition, as
the world fondly thought it, the devil
was carried out first, dead, hopelessly
dead, free-thinking priests, such as
Voltaire rebuked, bearing up the pall.
Though many a mocking <em>requiescat</em>
has been chanted over his grave,
like that of the church, it has proved
to be a cenotaph; and now that he
appears again, we can hardly wonder
if he finds himself more at home than
ever since Christianity came into the
world.</p>

<p>Satan has ever been, as the schoolmen
called him, God's ape (<i lang="la">simius
Dei</i>), reproducing in the mysteries of
the "Sabbath" the rites, and even the
organization, of the church; but now,
after the world's reiterated rejection
of Christ, it would seem that the
enemy has been permitted to carry
the parody a step further. Not only
wherever two or three are gathered
together in his name is he in their
midst, but, good shepherd-wise, he is
allowed to seek the sheep that had
been lost. Uninvited he seeks them
in the unromantic circle of XIXth-century
life, entrenched as this is
amongst elements the least promising,
one should think, for mysticism
of any sort. In bright, cheerful,
modern rooms, amongst the rustle
of innocent commonplaces, he finds
his opportunity and his profit, and
gently and genially weans his victims
from what fragments of dogmatic
religion they may still retain to the
liberty of his children. At least, there
is nothing unnatural in this view.</p>

<p>The third plea is, in the spiritualist's
mind, irresistible, and it has had,
doubtless, considerable influence in
preventing various religious persons
from condemning spiritualism. The
great evil of the day is materialism;
now, then, it is asked, is it conceivable
that the devil should appear as
the advocate of the two great spiritual
doctrines of the immortality of
the soul and the existence of God;
nay, should actually convert numbers
to a belief in these doctrines? I
answer, 1st, that when the devil first
came forward as the champion of
human liberty, he certainly did
preach both the immortality of the
soul and the existence of God. "Ye
shall not die." "Ye shall be as
gods." True, he was denying in
one breath the death of the body
and the death of the soul; but this is
quite in the fashion of spiritualism,
which invariably denounces any use
of the word "death." 2d, That the
doctrine of the immortality of the
soul loses all disciplinary force when
converted into that of endless, inevitable
progression. The possibility of
a miserable finality has been accepted
by the noblest philosophers as a
necessary phase in that melody of a
future life which, to use the expression
of Socrates (<cite>Phædo</cite>, cap. 63), it is
"so necessary for each man to sing
to himself." There are some, he had
said (cap. 62), whom "a befitting fate
casts into Tartarus, whence they
never come out." And in the last
book of the <cite>Republic</cite>, where human
life is described as going on in
an indefinite series of metempsychosis,
we are shown, as the generations
sweep round, a pit into which the
very bad fall out of the circle, never
to join it again. Nor is the doctrine
of the existence of God when converted
into pantheism of more avail.
A deity who is the mere <i lang="la">terminus
ad quem</i> of necessary evolution can
neither be feared as judge nor worshipped
as God.</p>

<p>Long experience has taught the
evil one that man cannot do without
religious sentiment; so he aims at
getting its circulation into his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[Pg 610]</a></span>
hands by coming forward boldly as
the advocate of its cardinal points.
He is determined to risk no more
disappointing losses, by striving to
feed men on the dry husks of materialism,
which are insufficient to
support life, and are sure, sooner or
later, to provoke nausea and repulsion.
As to those who have been
really converted from scepticism by
the spirits, nay, have been landed, as
has sometimes been the case, in the
bosom of the Catholic Church, I can
only say, Blessed be God! who has
ever exercised seignorial rights upon
the devil's fishing.</p>

<p>So much for the spiritualist amendment.
I shall now proceed to consider
the positive arguments and evidence
tending to show that spiritualism
is diabolic.</p>

<p>1st. I notice its shrinking and
disgust for all active Catholicism
which extends to the use of fragments
of Catholic truth in the hands of
zealous sectarians. This antipathy, I
contend, is invariable; but I must
guard against being misunderstood.
I admit that the spirits have indulged
from time to time in a considerable
amount of Catholic, or, I should
rather say Ritualist, talk. Several instances
may be found in Mr. Home's
séances in which holy-water and
crucifixes are spoken of with a certain
amount of unction. I admit,
too, that though sometimes the spirits
are discomfited by the mere presence
of a religious object&mdash;a medal, relic,
etc.&mdash;this is by no means ordinarily
the case. It is quite possible for religious
objects to be so presented as
in no way to embarrass the spirits,
who have been sometimes permitted
to carry them about with apparent
tenderness, even as Satan was allowed
to carry our Lord and set him on
a pinnacle of the temple. A sword
requires to be handled with a certain
amount of vigor and intention if it
is to avail as a weapon. If holy
objects are brought out simply as so
many Catholic testimonials and orders
of merit for the spirits, I know
nothing in the nature of things or in
the promises of God to prevent the
devil wearing them in his button-hole.
On the other hand, a man uncertain
of the spirits' character, but with an
honest and lively intention of rejecting
them so far as they are God's
enemies, "fugite partes adversæ,"
if he adjures them in his name, will
either reduce them to silence and
impotence, or extort the confession
that they are devils.</p>

<p>It would be easy to produce numbers
of instances of the extraordinarily
hostile sensitiveness of the spirits in
regard to the use in their presence
of Catholic prayers, medals, relics,
etc. In fact, in order to avoid being
a non-conductor, if not an obstructive,
a certain undogmatic attitude of
mind is required. We need not, indeed,
reject Christ, but we must be
prepared to look for another beside
him, if not in his place. Mr.
Home (<cite>Rep.</cite>, p. 188) says that, for the
medium's success, "the only thing
necessary is that the people about
should be harmonious." He explains
that "the 'harmonious' feeling
is simply that which you get on going
into a room and finding all the
people present such as you feel at
home with at once.... Scepticism
is not a hindrance; an unsympathetic
person is." I have no doubt that
this account is perfectly accurate so
far as it goes. A Christian's hatred of
what he suspects to be the devil, and
Professor Tyndall's contemptuous disgust
for what he considers a piece of
cheating, are both no doubt <em>natural</em>
impediments to spiritualistic manifestations;
although, in the former
case, it may well be that it is something
more.</p>

<p>The following scene from Pru<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[Pg 611]</a></span>dentius
(<cite>Apoth.</cite>, 460-502) illustrates
what I have said as to Christian rite
and formulary availing against sorcery,
not as a charm, but as a weapon
of faith. It must be remembered
that Julian had been baptized, but
his baptism had no effect in breaking
the magic rites. We venture
thus to render it:</p>

<p>The fathers have the completest
confidence in the efficacy of Christian
weapons in Christian hands, and even,
when used honestly, in hands not yet
Christian, to defeat sorcery.</p>

<p>Tertullian (<cite>Apol.</cite>, c. 23) throws out
this bold challenge: "Let any one,
known to have a devil, come before
your tribunal. That spirit, if bidden
speak by a Christian, shall as truly
confess himself a devil as he has
elsewhere falsely declared himself a
god. Or bring forward some one of
those who are thought to be divine
patients, who, sniffing up the altar's
deity, conceive of the steam, violent
retchers with panting utterance; the
heavenly Virgin herself, the promiser
of rain, Æsculapius too; ... if they
do not all confess themselves devils,
not daring to lie to a Christian, then
and there shed that insolent Christian's
blood."</p>

<p>Nor is it only the passionate Tertullian
who can speak thus. S. Athanasius
(<cite>De Incarn.</cite>, num. 48) is hardly
less energetic: "Let any one come
who wishes to test what we have said;
and let him, in the midst of the manifestations
of demons, and the guiles
of oracles, and the marvels of magic,
use the sign of the cross, which these
mock at, or merely name Christ, he
shall soon see how quickly the demons
are routed, the oracles silenced, the
whole magic art and its charms utterly
wiped out."</p>

<p>The instances of modern spiritualist
manifestations being stopped by
religious adjuration are very frequent.</p>

<p>Mr. Glover (<cite>Rep.</cite>, p. 205) had been
asking the spirits about the time of
our Lord's coming; they had answered
glibly enough, and had pointed
out several texts in the Bible, when,
apparently on a sudden impulse, "he
made a cross in a circle, and asked,
in the name of the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost, if the communications
were of God, and the answer was
'No.' He then asked if they were
of the devil, and the answer was
'Yes.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[Pg 612]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Chevalier (<cite>Rep.</cite>, p. 218) says
that, after having received several
communications purporting to come
from his recently-lost child, "One
day the table turned at right angles,
and went into a corner of the room.
I asked, 'Are you my child?' but
obtained no answer. I then said,
'Are you from God?' but the table
was silent. I then said, 'In the name
of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
I command you to answer; are you
from God?' One loud rap&mdash;a negative&mdash;was
then given. 'Do you believe,'
said I, 'that Christ died to
save us from sin?' The answer was,
'No.' 'Accursed spirit!' said I,
'leave the room.' The table then
walked across the room, entered the
adjoining one, and quickened its
steps. It was a small, tripod table.
It walked with a sidelong walk. It
went to the door, shook the handle,
and I opened it. The table then
walked into the passage, and I repeated
the adjuration, receiving the
same answer. Fully convinced that
I was dealing with an accursed spirit,
I opened the street-door, and the
table was immediately silent; no
movement or rap was heard. I returned
alone to the drawing-room,
and asked if there were any spirits
present. Immediately I heard steps,
like those of a little child, outside the
door. I opened it, and the small
table went into the corner as before,
just as my child did when reproved
for a fault. These manifestations
continued until I used the adjuration,
and I always found that they changed
or ceased when the name of God was
used."</p>

<p>Miss Anna Blackwell (<cite>Rep.</cite>, p. 220)
gives her evidence immediately after
Mr. Chevalier's. Whilst admitting the
fact that the spirits often call themselves
devils, she suggests a twofold
explanation: 1st. That they are
coarse, undeveloped spirits. 2d. That
they are vexed at the rude treatment
they have received. She is speaking
of her sister's mediumship: "The
spirit would use her hand to write
what communication had to be
made. The spirits wrote what was
good and bad. One wanted to sign
himself Satan and Beelzebub; but,"
continues Miss Blackwell, "my sister
did not believe in the existence of
any such a spirit, and she said, 'No;
if you are permitted to come to me,
it is not to tell such outrageous lies.
If you persist in trying to impose
upon me, you sha'n't write.' I have
been present at many such little
fights. She would resist the spirit,
and, when she saw the capital S of
Satan being written, would twist her
hand. The spirit has then written,
'I hate you, because I cannot
deceive you.' ... We never begin
without prayer. We say to the
spirits that wish to deceive us, 'Dear
spirits, we are all imperfect; we will
endeavor to benefit you by our
lights, in so far as they are superior
to yours.' Sometimes they would
overturn and break the table; yet
they were rendered better by our
kindness. We would never dream
of addressing one as an 'accursed
spirit.' From one who was very violent,
and by whom I have been myself
struck, we have received progressive
messages, saying, 'We are
going up higher now; we have,
through your help, broken the chains
of earth, and we leave you.' When
my sister found the S being written,
or the capital B for Beelzebub, she
would say with kindness, but firmness,
'Dear spirit, you must not deceive;
it is not for such tricks, but
for a good end, that you are permitted
to come.'"</p>

<p>It is often said that the education
question is the question of the day;
but I was hardly prepared to find that
it embraced the spirit-world. I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[Pg 613]</a></span>
not which to pity most, those to
whom the responsibility has been
brought home of having to educate
a vast number of imperfect spirits,
who are, as Miss Blackwell admits,
"all in a manner devils," or the
wretched spirits who have thus to
begin all over again as day-scholars
at a dame's school.</p>

<p>According to Miss Blackwell's
theory, the church is evidently responsible
for the existence of the
devil. So far as he can be said to
exist at all, he is the church's creation;
for, instead of doing her best
to instruct and humanize the rude
but well-meaning spirit Arab thrown
upon her hands, she has goaded him
to desperation by addressing him as
"<i lang="la">Maledicte damnate</i>." Oh! if she
had only called him "dear spirit,"
with Miss Blackwell, he might ere
now have comported himself conformably,
instead of masquerading
under such uncomfortable names as
Satan and Beelzebub and doing a
world of mischief.</p>

<p>My second argument is the similarity
between spiritualism and mediæval
witchcraft. I have already noticed
incidentally several points of
resemblance, and would now draw
attention to what is, perhaps, the
most important point of all. Of
course, such similarity has no argumentative
force if Miss Blackwell's
theory be admitted.</p>

<p>As I have before remarked, one
of the most prominent characteristics
of mediæval magic was its being a
parody of the church. The principal
ceremony of the "Sabbath" was a
diabolical burlesque of the Mass, in
which the devil preached, and the
celebrant stood on his head, and the
servers genuflected backwards. Now,
amongst modern spiritualists I have
discovered no such violation of decency;
the parody is not so complete,
and, on the whole, it is a decorous
one; but it unmistakably exists,
and is on the increase. It is by no
means uncommon to assemble the
spirit circle before an altar with crucifix
and candles. In <cite>Experiences
with D. D. Home</cite> we find that that
gentleman has quite a craving in
this direction. He baptizes with
sand, he stretches himself in the form
of a cross, imitates the phenomena
of Pentecost, the rushing wind, the
dove, the tongues of fire, and is
perpetually anointing his friends with
some mysterious substance, which apparently
emanates from his hands.</p>

<p>Against what has been said on
behalf of the devil hypothesis the
spiritualist can urge nothing, except
the by no means unwavering testimony
of the spirits themselves, and
the spiritualist's own recognition of
the identity of his departed friends.
As to the spirits' testimony, it is
worth just nothing. Evil spirits
have always personated the dead,
as philosophers, fathers, schoolmen
with one accord testify. As to the
recognition of friends, I should wish
to treat with all due consideration
the natural craving of friends to obtain
some intelligence of their departed
friends; but, on the one hand,
minute imitations of manner are certainly
not beyond the devil's power;
on the other, affection is anything
but keen-sighted, and the rapture of
a communication at all, when once
the idea is admitted, is apt to throw
all minor details into the shade.
Was not Lady Tichbourne able to
trace the features of her drowned
boy in the Claimant's photograph?</p>

<p>Wherever the spirits have represented
persons of known character
and ability&mdash;men, for instance, who
have left a gauge of their mental
qualities in their writings, like Shakespeare
or Bacon&mdash;the personation has
been invariably a lamentable and
most palpable failure. That the spi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[Pg 614]</a></span>rits
of clever men do not at all talk
up to the mark is notorious and generally
admitted by candid spiritualists.
Mr. Simkiss (<cite>Rep.</cite>, p. 133) says,
"Beyond solving the important question,
'If a man die, shall he live
again?' by the very fact of spirits
communicating and proving their
identity, there is to me little that is
consistent or reliable in what is revealed
through different mediums."
Mr. Varley (p. 168) endeavors to explain
the feebleness of spirit-talk by
want of education and development
on the part of the mediums by which
their communications are conditioned.
I do not say that there is not
something in this; but surely the
communications of genius would,
under the most adverse circumstances,
take the form rather of broken
sense than fluent twaddle.</p>

<p>The extreme irritation invariably
manifested by the spirits towards anything
like suspicion, particularly if it
take the form of trying to subject them
to a religious test, is surely grotesquely
unnatural in the case of spirits who
have shuffled off the coil of mortality,
with whom life's fitful fever
has passed. We have at least
some right to expect that persons
who in their lifetime had a reasonable
amount of dignity and patience
should have increased rather than
diminished their stock of virtue with
their enlarged experience, unless, indeed,
they have so lost God as to
have lost themselves.</p>

<p>It is difficult to conceive a justification
for the spiritualist who, believing
that he is dealing with spirits,
refuses to entertain the idea that
these may be devils, and makes no
attempt to bring them to a test. His
best excuse, perhaps, would be that
the world has to such an extent lost
its standard of faith and morals
wherewith to test anything.</p>

<p>Spiritualists may object that some
thing, at least, of what I have urged
against them avails as much, or even
more, against the devil hypothesis.
Thus, if the spirit of Bacon is too
nonsensical for Bacon, <i lang="fr">à fortiori</i> he
is too nonsensical for Lucifer, who
must needs be the cleverer spirit of
the two. Upon this I observe that
the retort shows a complete ignorance
of the devil's character and
position. "The character of a
myth," some one interposes. Well, I
am not now discussing his existence.
Even a myth must be in keeping.
You have no right to give Cerberus
four heads, or make him mew instead
of bark, for all he is a myth. I suppose
people have been seduced by
Milton's grand conception of the
"archangel fallen" and the splendid
melancholy of his solemn rhetoric;
but the devil of theology never says
anything wise or fine. He is, indeed,
understood to retain the natural powers
with which he was created; but
he is wholly averse from the God
whom all wise and fine utterances
do, in their measure, praise. Wherefore
all such are in the highest degree
repugnant to Satan. Neither
are such costly and uncongenial deceits
necessary to beguile man. Selfinterest
and curiosity may be gratified
at a cheaper rate.</p>

<p>The concessions of spiritualists
themselves in reality reduce the difference
between us very considerably.
I have gained all that I care for, if it
be conceded that these spirits may be
the spirits of the damned, who are
equivalently devils; and Miss Blackwell
admits that these spirits are "in
a manner devils," and Mr. Home
(<cite>Experiences</cite>, p. 167) says of some
of them: "I tell you you do not
know the danger, they are so fearfully
low&mdash;the very lowest and most material
of all. You might almost call
them 'accursed.' They will get a
power over you that you cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[Pg 615]</a></span>
break through." The one great difference
between us is that consistent
spiritualists hold that there is no finality;
that these irrepressible devils&mdash;for
they are always obtruding themselves
amongst the respectable spirit
guests&mdash;may be reformed. But even
so, would it not be well to consider
whether the chances are not in favor
of our being ruined before they are
restored? Once and again it may be
that a spirit speaks to them who is
from God, even as God spake sometimes
in the high places of Baal.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
But God is not wont to reward imprudence,
and, on their own showing,
spiritualists stand convicted of the
most extraordinary rashness in thus
exposing themselves to the whirlwind
of spirit influence without having a
spiritual constitution, so to speak, or
any canons or habits of spiritual life
wherewith the influence can be tested.</p>

<p>Man, as Alvernus finely says, is a
being created "upon the horizon of
two worlds"&mdash;the world of sense and
the world of spirit. But in the sensible
world only is he at home, wherein
his material nature is sufficiently
developed for him to hold his own;
whereas, in the spirit-world, with
which he is also in contact, the God
of both worlds must be his guide, or,
horsed upon his excited imagination,
he may easily be lost in the wilderness,
and fall a prey to lawless spirits.
Nothing can be more striking than
the contrast between the sobriety of
the Catholic Church in her dealings
with the spirit-world and the rashness
of spiritualists. The church has always
recognized as a reality spirit
communications of various kinds,
good and bad; but she has always
tested most rigidly the character of
the spirits; and even when these have
satisfied every test, she has only allowed
their sanctity to be highly probable;
she has never, so to speak,
granted them her <em>testamur</em>. They
are ever on their trial, inasmuch as
she insists that the lessons they communicate
shall be in strict subordination
to the rule of faith and morals;
in other words, to the ordinary duties
of life. The church has ever shown
herself keenly alive to the dangers
of supernatural intercourse. She has
been jealously on her guard against
overwrought sentimentalism, vanity,
or any strained or undue development
of one part of the patient's moral nature
at the expense of the rest.</p>

<p>Whilst she prizes amongst the
choicest of her devotional treasures
the private revelations of her saints,
such as those of S. Bridget, S. Gertrude,
S. Catharine of Sienna, and
many more, yet if one consults the
great masters of Christian spiritualism,
if I may so speak&mdash;such as S. John of
the Cross, for example&mdash;who have
themselves experienced the favors of
which they treat&mdash;the ecstasy, the
vision, and the prophecy&mdash;one is
more struck than by anything else by
the stern common sense of their precautions
against deception, and the
sad sobriety of their confession that,
after all, you can hardly ever be quite
sure that you are not the victim of an
illusion.</p>

<p>That a certain moral discipline is
necessary in order not to be deceived,
even when you are dealing with one
who has a true spirit of prophecy, is
implied in the words of Ezechiel, cap.
xiv.: "For every man of the house
of Israel, and every stranger among
the proselytes in Israel, if he separate
himself from me, and place his idols
in his heart, and set the stumbling-block
of his iniquity before his face
and come to the prophet to inquire
of me by him: I the Lord will answer
him by myself.... And when
the prophet shall err and speak
a word, I the Lord have deceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[Pg 616]</a></span>
that prophet.... According to the
iniquity of him that inquireth, so shall
the iniquity of the prophet be."</p>

<p>S. Augustine (<cite>De Gen. ad Lit.</cite>, lib.
xii. c. 13, 14) might be warning those
spiritualists who place their security
in the peacefulness and truthfulness
of their communications: "The discernment
of spirits is very difficult.
When the evil spirit plays the peaceful
(<i lang="la">quasi tranquillus agit</i>), and, having
possessed himself of a man's spirit
without harassing his body, says
what he is able, enunciates true doctrine,
and gives useful information,
transfiguring himself into an angel of
light, to the end that, when persons
have trusted him in what is clearly
good, he may afterwards win them
to himself. I do not think he can be
discerned except by means of that
gift of which the apostle saith when
speaking of the diverse gifts of God:
'To another discernment of spirits.'
It is no great thing to discover him
when he has gone so far as to do
anything against good morals or the
rule of faith, for then he is discovered
by many; but by the aforesaid gift,
in the very beginning, whilst to many
he still appears good, his badness is
found out forthwith."</p>

<p>Again (<cite>Confess.</cite>, lib. x. c. 35), he
speaks of the danger of seeking
supernatural communications: "In
the religious life itself, men tempt
God when they demand signs and
marvels, not for any one's healing, but
simply for the sake of the experience.
In this vast wood, full of snares and
dangers, what have I not had to drive
away from my heart! What suggestions
and machinations does not the
enemy bring to bear upon me, that I
may ask for a sign! But I beseech
thee that even as all consent thereto
is far from me, so it may be ever further
and further."</p>

<p>Amort, <cite>De Rev. Priv.</cite>, p. 20, from
Gravina, says: "It is often easier to
establish the certainty of the deceitfulness
of an apparition than of its
truthfulness, because bad angels have
their own characteristics, which good
angels never imitate; on the other
hand, the bad often imitate the appearance
and manner of the good."</p>

<p>Amort, <em>ibid.</em>, p. 104, from S. John
of the Cross, says: "All apparitions,
visions, revelations, consolations,
sweetnesses, sensations, etc., which
are received by the external senses,
should ever and always be refused
by the soul as much as in it lies....
In most cases they are diabolical....
When they are from God, they are
sent in order that they may be despised,
and that the soul, by means of
the victory wherewith it overcomes
these pleasures of the senses, divine
though they be, may be led to the
things of the understanding."</p>

<p><em>Ibid.</em>, p. 115: "When the words in
any supposed revelation take the
form of a process of reasoning after
the application of the soul in contemplation,
God, the natural reason,
and the devil may all three concur in
the same process."</p>

<p>No test of the holiness of a manifestation
is considered quite satisfactory
save that of a continued increase
in virtue, especially in humility, in
degrees corresponding to the increase
of the favor; for the devil will not
consent to be a master of virtue.
When S. Teresa had scruples as to
the source of her favors, it was thus
her director consoled her.</p>

<p>So cautious is Catholic mysticism;
whilst spiritualists are not afraid to
keep a sort of spirit-ordinary, where</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"White spirits and black, red spirits and gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mingle, mingle, mingle; those that mingle may."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>I repeat it, spiritualists who think they
are communicating with spirits, and
take no pains to test their character,
as though the hypothesis of a devil
were absurd, are inexcusably silly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[Pg 617]</a></span></p>

<p>I must now consider some objections
in the mouth of persons who,
without pretending that they have
found any satisfactory solution of the
question in the theories of unconscious
cerebration or psychic force,
are nevertheless exceedingly impressed
by the strong psychic element in
the phenomena of spiritualism&mdash;the
apparent necessity for the presence
of one or more persons of a peculiar
nervous organization, for a certain
harmonious mixture, or rather melodious
articulation, of the company, in
order to produce the desired effect.
"Surely," they say, "such law, <em>i.e.</em>,
such regular alternation of cause and
effect, as can be discovered is psychic.
So far as we can subject the phenomena
to ordinary scientific tests,
everything points to their being the
product of the psychic force of a
certain peculiarly constituted company."
This is the tone of Mr. Cox's
recent letter to the <cite>Times</cite>, and Mr.
Edwin Arnold's letter in the <cite>Report</cite>
is quite in the same key.</p>

<p>My answer is that I admit all that
they say. Of course, so much of law
as is detected is psychic. There is
no other law at work within the
sphere of our discovery. The question
is whether there are not indications
of an influence at work which
is irreducible to psychic laws, whilst
using, in a partially abnormal manner,
psychic force.</p>

<p>Mr. Lewes will urge (letter, <cite>Rep.</cite>,
p. 264): "I might propose as an
hypothesis that the chair leaped because
a kobold tilted it up; ...
but you would not believe in the
presence of a kobold, because his
presence would enable you to explain
the phenomena." Most indubitably
I should, if no less an hypothesis
would explain the phenomena;
particularly if I had otherwise reason
to believe in the existence and operation
of kobolds. I should hold
the likelihood of the hypothesis of
his action in the particular case as
steadily increasing in proportion as
the other hypotheses tended to break
down.</p>

<p>"No guess," Mr. Lewes insists,
"need be rejected, if it admits of
verification; <em>no guess that cannot be
verified is worth a moment's attention</em>."
The last part of this trenchant dictum
<em>is</em> worth a moment's attention. If it
simply mean that it is not worth a
scientific man's while to attempt a
direct scientific examination of what
clearly admits of no such treatment,
I can only say that, however much
the scientific man may sometimes
need the lesson, it is neither more
nor less than a truism. If it mean
that no hypothesis is to be regarded
by any one as "worth a moment's
attention" which science can never
hope directly to verify, it is conspicuously
untrue. Even a <i lang="la">terra
incognita</i> is not without scientific
interest as marking a boundary; nay,
it may be scientifically proved to contain
a place known to exist and
proved not to exist in any known
lands.</p>

<p>Of course, the devil, or kobold, if
Mr. Lewes prefers it, cannot be verified
in the sense of caught and handed
over to scientific men as a specimen
of spiritualistic fauna. Neither
do I suppose he can be really detected,
except by the standard of
Catholic truth, by Catholic tests, and
Catholic weapons; and even then,
in the eyes of unbelievers, he will be
no further identified than as an adverse
intelligence in a very bad temper.
But surely this is enough,
where men's minds have not been
reduced to mere machines for registering
rigid scientific results, to secure
the devil hypothesis something

<p>What law we detect in spiritualistic
phenomena I conceive to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[Pg 618]</a></span>
working of the conditions in subordination
to which the devil is able
to communicate with man. This
subordination is probably owing, in
part, to the nature of things which
compels certain things to accost certain
other things in one way and not
another, in part to the merciful reservation
of God. It would seem as
if the spirits were, on the whole, prevented
from being more irreligious
than the prevailing tone of the company,
or at least of the most irreligious
portion of it. It may very
well be that the conditions limiting
diabolical intercourse are more complex
and imperious, where the spirit
"<i lang="la">quasi tranquillus agit</i>, without harassing
the body." In mediæval
<em>diablerie</em>, the demon is often represented
as hindered or assisted by instruments
of a purely physical character;
thus Coleridge makes Christabel
lift the enchantress over the
threshold. A crowd, by neutralizing
individual resistance, may present
fewer obstacles to the devil&mdash;nay,
may supply a medium of its own;
just as frightened cattle huddled-together
in a thunder-storm are said,
by the steam-column arising from
their tightly compacted bodies, to furnish
a conductor for the lightning.</p>

<p>I have indicated in several places
of these essays what I conceive to be
the objects the devil has in view in
lending himself to spiritualism. His
main object, I can hardly doubt, is to
do with religious sentiment what we
are told Mr. Fisk tried to do with
the gold currency of America&mdash;"corner
it," get its circulation into his
own hands. In the numberless cases
where religion is nothing more than
sentiment, he is only too likely to succeed;
second-sight is so much more
satisfying to the imagination, and at
the same time so far more modest in
its demands upon the will, than faith.
The spread of spiritualism in the
last few years is notorious, and there
is every prospect of its continuing.
Whether it will ever enter upon a
new phase of existence, and become
a fact publicly acknowledged by scientific
men, is a question. It has
never been so recognized amongst
civilized nations. Whatever miracles,
divine or diabolical, were meant to
effect, it was not to overbalance the
general sway of purely human power,
of which this world is the appointed
stage. As a general rule, the brilliant
series of miracles by which the
Christian martyr has baffled death
in the presence of admiring crowds
has ended in quiet decapitation at
a convenient mile-stone. Many a
time, doubtless, has the Roman headsman
flattered himself that his good
straight-down blow effectually upset
that fine story made up out of a
drugged lion and a fagot of green
wood, which had somehow imposed
upon so many stupid people. Not,
of course, that I am denying that
there have been miracles which imperiously
asserted themselves over
all obstacles, like the series which
ended in Pharao's drowning; but,
as a general rule, God has spoken
once and again, and then prosaic
obstinacy has been given its way.
On these occasions, God has no
doubt submitted himself to a general
law which he has made for all direct
spiritual interference, and which
he mercifully enforces with especial
strictness in the case of the devil.</p>

<p>Any civilized nation engaged in
active pursuits will always be likely
to contain, one should think, a majority
among its scientific men who
will be unfitted to experience, and
indisposed to believe in, and still
more to acknowledge, the phenomena
of spiritualism. But it is impossible
to say; the spiritualistic system as
developed by Allan Kardec (see Miss
Blackwell's communication, <cite>Rep.</cite>, p<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[Pg 619]</a></span>
284) seems to lend itself in a remarkable
way to some of the most prominent
scientific tendencies of the day.
If ever Darwinists should stand in
need of the consolations of religious
enthusiasm, they might find a congenial
home in spiritualism. In the
vast system of metempsychosis to
which Miss Blackwell introduces us,
we have all the Darwinian stages
and to spare. First in order comes
the "primordial fluid," "containing
all the elements of derived existence,"
"the first substantiation of
creative thought." "There are three
orders or modes of substantiality"&mdash;"psychic
substance," and "corporeal
substance," and "dynamic substance,
or force," which last is stated
to partake of the nature of the two
other modes, and to be the intermediary
between them.</p>

<p>(P. 300) "Every state of the psychic
element determines corresponding
vibrations of the dynamic element,
which, effecting corresponding
aggregations of the atoms of the
material element, produce the substance
or body which is the material
expression of that state." The soul's
magnetic envelope, "perisprit," is at
once its first garment and the instrument
by which it aggregates to itself
the elements of its body.</p>

<p>This system embraces a twofold
metempsychosis&mdash;that of formation
and that of reformation. The first
is the process by which the impersonal
psychic element is gradually
prepared for individualization or
the attainment of conscious personality
by being transfused progressively
through the mineral, vegetable,
and animal worlds&mdash;the same process,
but with a different final cause, it
would seem, as that described by the
poet:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Spiritus intus alit, totamque infusa per artus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mens agitat molem et magno se corpore miscet."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The psychic element is presented,
not as feeding, but as feeding on successive
worlds, like a silk-worm on
mulberry-leaves, leaving geological
strata behind it, for instance, as the
refuse of its mineral sojourn.</p>

<p>Souls are first individualized in the
fluidic or atmospheric world; and if
they are docile to the instruction of
that world, they never "incur the
penalty of incarceration in bodies of
planetary matter, and consequently
never become men," but remain in
this or that fluidic world until ripe
for the highest or "sidereal order."
On the other hand, the spirits who
are indocile enter upon the second
series of metempsychosis, "having
brought upon themselves the penalty
of exile in a planet corresponding,
in the compactness or comparative
fluidity of its material constituents, to
the degree of their culpability."</p>

<p>(P. 309) "The moral and intellectual
state of the soul decides the corresponding
magnetic action of the
perisprit, and thereby decides the
nature of the body which is formed
by that action."</p>

<p>(319) "While accomplishing the
new series of incorporations in progressively
nobler forms, in higher
and higher planets, the spirit goes
back, at each disaggregation of its
material envelope, into the fluidic
sphere of the planet in which its last
material embodiment has been accomplished."</p>

<p>(322) "The fluidic world being
the normal world of souls, we remain
in intimate (though usually unconscious)
connection with the fluidic
sphere of the planet, while incarnated
on its surface. We return to it during
sleep, when, through the elasticity
of the perisprit (which has been
seen by clairvoyants elongated into a
sort of luminous cord connecting the
soul with the sleeping body), we are
enabled to visit our friends in the
other life."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[Pg 620]</a></span></p>

<p>(326) "The more extended vision
of the fluidic sphere shows (its inhabitants)
a wide range of human actions
and intentions, and thus enables
them to forecast with more or less
correctness, and, when permitted to
do so, to predict the same with more
or less exactness, according to the
flexibility of the medium."</p>

<p>S. Augustine has a fine passage in
his <cite>De Divinatione Dæmonum</cite>, cap.
iii., comparing the keenness and
swiftness (<i lang="la">acrimonia sensûs et celeritas
motûs</i>) which the devils possess
in virtue of their fluidic state (<i lang="la">aerium
corpus</i>) to the vulture's knowledge,
who, "when the carcase is thrown out,
flies up from an unseen distance;
and to the osprey's, who, floating aloft,
is said at that vast height to see the
fish swimming beneath the waves, and
fiercely smiting the water with outstretched
legs and talons, to ravish
it."</p>

<p>I can conceive the attractions of
such a system, combining, as it does,
the ingenuity and fulness of Platonism
with something of the color and
rhythm of modern science. If any
concordat is to be made between
religious enthusiasm unattached and
science, I do not think the chances
of spiritualism are to be despised.
Just at present, however, although
some scientific men have taken up
spiritualism, there can be no doubt
that, on the whole, spiritualism and
science are at daggers drawn. There
is no mistaking the utter loathing expressed
in Professor Huxley's letter
(<cite>Rep.</cite>, p. 229), in which he declines
to take any part in the committee's
investigation, on the ground that,
"supposing the phenomena to be
true, they do not interest me." He
has a perfect right to compare spiritualistic
talk to "the chatter of old
women and curates in a cathedral
town"; but his anger has made him
quite miss the logical point of the
position. The privilege he declines
as worthless is the opportunity, not
of listening to such conversation, but
of examining and testing the hitherto
ignored faculty; and this no man can
seriously reject as uninteresting.</p>

<p>There is no difficulty in understanding
the bitterness with which modern
science regards spiritualism. It had
been for so long carrying everything
before it; it had weighed so many
things on earth and in the heavens;
it had reduced so many apparently
eccentric phenomena to law; its discoveries
had been so brilliant, and
its still more brilliant projections
were so plausible, that it flattered itself
that all idea of the supernatural
was fairly relegated to the obscure
past or to the obscurer future. The
philosophy of the XIXth century
was being fast reduced to a bare
statement of the contents of sensation,
and the philosophers of the day
were looking for an easy victory over
the most respectable of dogmatic
traditions, when, lo! full in the calm
scientific light, the singularly grotesque
form of spiritualism lifts its
head, and the warrior who had so
loudly challenged the king to mortal
combat finds himself set upon by
the court fool. When earth, according
to the poet's dream, should be
"lapped in universal law," up starts
a mass of phenomena not merely inexplicable
by any known law, but, in
popular estimation at least, incompatible
with any hypothesis but that
of supernatural agency. It has been
the more intolerable that spiritualism
had affected an imposing vocabulary
of scientific terms, recommending itself
to its audience by an appeal to
partially known laws, such as magnetism
and electricity, whilst really
indulging in the most unblushing
necromancy. Thus the scientific
formulæ have been given somewhat
the <i lang="fr">rôle</i> of captives in the triumph of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[Pg 621]</a></span>
superstition. No wonder scientific
men are angry. But whilst they "do
well to be angry," I think they do by
no means well to refuse to investigate
the subject because on various
accounts it is offensive to them.</p>

<p>Scientific men frequently complain
that spiritualists will not submit their
séances to the test of a public examination
in broad daylight. Now, this is
really not a fair statement of the case.
Spiritualists say that they have
found by experience that a certain
class of phenomena require dark or
twilight; but a vast number of independent
physical manifestations do
take place in broad daylight. On
the other hand, when the scientific
investigator insists upon interfering
with the constituents of the séance,
the arrangement of the circle, etc.,
the spiritualist answers, fairly enough,
that, since under the most favorable
conditions the success of the séance
cannot be reckoned on, it would be
absurd to allow the abandonment
of what experience has shown to be
a necessary condition of success.
"With the phenomena of magic we
can experimentalize but little; neither
can we evoke the least of them at
our good pleasure. We can but observe
them where they present themselves,
gather them into corresponding
groups, and discover among
them common features and common
laws." (Perty, <cite>Mystisch. Erscheinungen&mdash;Vorrede</cite>,
p. xi.) This being
understood, spiritualists invite the
representatives of science to make
what observations they please in
broad daylight, when, at least, they
will be able to discount such disturbing
conditions as they may not eliminate.
It is an <em>onus</em>, certainly, for
the investigator to have to form a
part of what is going on; but this is
no more than the detective undergoes
when he plays the accomplice in order
to discover the thief. Say that
spiritualism is a folly, a disease, what
you will, it is at least of the highest
scientific interest and practical importance
that we should understand
its conditions and action as thoroughly
as possible. If scientific men
have no more serious scruple to
keep them aloof than the dignity of
their order&mdash;for, after all, this is what
Mr. Huxley's excuses come to&mdash;the
exigencies of the case require that it
should be put aside. If the mountain
will not come to Mahomet, Mahomet
must go to the mountain.</p>

<p>Nothing is more calculated to bring
out the inherent diversities of the
human mind than the investigation
of spiritualism; for it not only involves
an examination of some of the
most difficult problems relating to
evidence, but, indirectly at least, an
examination of the whole process by
which each individual concerned rejects
or assimilates his mental pabulum.
Hence the extraordinary difficulty
of conducting such an inquiry
without incessant wrangling. The
Committee of the Dialectical Society,
to whose <cite>Report</cite> I have so often
referred, is quite a case in point. Its
<cite>Report</cite> is the record of a schism,
of an irreconcilable clash of opinions.
If the committee had waited until
these had been reduced to harmony,
the <cite>Report</cite> would never have been
published. One of the principal members&mdash;Dr.
Edmunds&mdash;was, I think,
exceptionally tried. His own opinion
was and is that spiritualism is a
mixture of trickery and delusion; but
his own dining-room table habitually
took sides against him, and this in
the most treacherous manner. It
used to wait until he had left the
room, and then, in the presence of
the other investigators, run around
with nobody touching it.</p>

<p>You might almost as well meddle
with a man's digestion as with his
belief. Prove that his convictions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[Pg 622]</a></span>
are groundless, and he feels as outraged
as though you had affixed a
register to his waistcoat which showed
the world that his favorite dish
had disagreed with him. Dr. Garth
Wilkinson (<cite>Rep.</cite>, p. 234) is by no
means singular in his experience
"that nearly all truth is temperamental
to us, or given in the affections
or intuitions, and that discussion and
inquiry do little more than feed the
temperament." And what a variety
of temperaments will inevitably be
found in any committee of investigation&mdash;men
who, like Mr. Lewes, consider
the possibility of an hypothesis
which cannot be rigidly tested unworthy
of consideration, or like Mr.
Grattan Geary (<cite>Rep.</cite>, p. 95), who, on
finding that many eminent men are
spiritualists, is simply impressed by
the number of eminent men who are
enjoying an unmerited reputation
for sanity. After all, men make
more account, as a general rule, of
one little bit of experience, the real
force of which is incommunicable,
and which, when put into words for
another's benefit, is often to the last
degree trivial, than of all the arguments
in the world. A charming example
of this is given by Dr. H.
More in a letter to Glanville, published
at the beginning of the latter's
<cite>Sadducismus Triumphatus</cite>: "I remember
an old gentleman in the
country of my acquaintance, an excellent
justice of the peace, and a
piece of a mathematician; but what
sort of a philosopher he was you
may understand from a rhime of his
own making, which he commended
to me on my taking horse in his
yard, which rhime is this:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">An <em>ens</em> is nothing till sense find out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sense ends in nothing, so naught goes about;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>which rhime of his was so rapturous
to himself that, at the reciting of the
second verse, the old man turned
himself about upon his toe as nimbly
as one may see a dry leaf
whisk'd round in the corner of an orchard-walk
by some little whirlwind.
With this philosopher I have had
many discourses concerning the immortality
of the soul and its distinction.
When I have run him quite
down by reason, he would laugh and
say, 'That is logick, H.,' calling me
by my Christian name. To which I
replied, 'This is reason, Fr. L. (for so
I and some others used to call him),
but it seems you are for the new
light and direct inspiration,' which, I
confess, he was as little for as for the
other; but I said so only by way of
drollery to him in those times. But
truth is, nothing but palpable experience
could move him; and being a
bold man, and fearing nothing, he
told me he had tried all the ceremonies
of conjuration he could to raise
the devil or a spirit, and had a most
earnest desire to meet with one, but
never could do it. But this he told
me: when he did not so much as
think of it, while his servant was
pulling off his boots in the hall, some
invisible hand gave him such a clap
on the back that it made all ring
again. So, thought he, now I am
invited to the converse of my spirit;
and therefore, so soon as his boots
were off and his shoes on, out he
went into the yard and next field to
find out the spirit that had given him
this familiar clap on the back, but
found none neither in the yard nor
field next to it. But though he did
not feel the stroke, albeit he thought
it afterwards (finding nothing come
of it) a mere delusion, yet, not long
before his death, it had more force
with him than all the philosophical
arguments I could use to him, though
I could wind him and nonplus as I
pleased; but yet all my arguments,
how solid soever, made no impression
upon him. Wherefore, after several
reasonings of this nature, whereby I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[Pg 623]</a></span>
would prove the soul's distinction
from the body, and its immortality,
when nothing of such subtile considerations
did any more execution on
his mind than some lightning is said
to do, though it melts the sword,
upon the fuzzy consistency of the
scabbard, well, said I, Fr. L., though
none of these things move you, I
have something still behind, and
what you yourself acknowledged to
me, that may do the business. Do
you remember that clap on the back
when your servant was pulling off
your boots in the hall? Assure
yourself, said I, Fr. L., that goblin
will be the first that will bid you
welcome into the other world. Upon
that his countenance changed most
sensibly, and he was more confounded
with this rubbing up of his memory
than with all the rational and
philosophical arguments I could produce."</p>

<p>Whilst admitting that the <cite>Report</cite>
of the Dialectical Society indicates
a very considerable initial success, I
cannot but feel the undiminished importance
of W. M. Wilkinson's rather
caustic warning (<cite>Rep.</cite>, p. 231): "The
first thing in such an investigation is
to assume nothing, not even that a
committee of the Dialectical Society
can 'obtain a satisfactory elucidation
of the phenomena.' No committee
has ever done so yet. A committee
of professors of Harvard University,
amongst whom was Agassiz, after
they had made an examination, did
not think proper to publish their report,
though they had published
their intention to do so, and were
frequently and publicly asked for it."
The London Society has, at least improved
upon the example.</p>

<p>I have maintained throughout that
neither the hypothesis of trickery
nor of delusion can be sustained for
a moment as an adequate explanation
of the phenomena of spiritualism,
on grounds which may be thus
summarized: 1. Many of these phenomena
outdo all conjuring. 2.
They take place where the possibility
of trickery has been eliminated.
3. The exhibition of imaginative
excitement is, on the whole, inconsiderable,
and there is no appreciable
proportion between the degrees
of excitement and the phenomena.
But, at the same time, I am far from
maintaining that there is no trickery
amongst the mediums, and no predisposition
in the company tending
more or less to disqualify them from
detecting it. I am inclined to think
that more or less trickery forms part
of the stock in trade of most mediums,
but that its share in the production
of phenomena is comparatively
slight.</p>

<p>Mr. Browning's marvellous conception
of <cite>Sludge the Medium</cite> is based,
I admit, upon a real, existing
unscrupulosity on the one side, and
on a real, existing gullibility on the
other; but these are magnified into
colossal and perfectly unreal proportions
so far as Sludge is to be taken
as a representative of his class. In
many cases a single fraud may fairly
be taken to vitiate the whole projection.
If in a chemical demonstration,
for instance, we were to discover
the secret substitution, by the operator,
of an ingredient not in the programme,
we might fairly conclude
that the whole thing was a pretence;
that there was nothing in it. But
this is not necessarily so in the case
of spiritualism; the lie or trick does
not always imply the total absence
of other force, but may be an initial
ceremony, preparing the company by
quickening their expectations, and
propitiating the evil influence by an
acceptable sacrifice of human honor.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that there is
something very suggestive of trickery,
and of silly trickery, in the attempts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[Pg 624]</a></span>
made from time to time by the spirits
to flatter into good-humor the anti-spiritualistic
critic of the company; as
when Professor Tyndall was dubbed
"Poet of Science,"<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> and when Dr.
Edmunds' portrait was given in such
glowing colors that, except in the
character of a sceptic, he would have
been ashamed to reproduce it (<cite>Report</cite>).
Again, that something like
systematic trickery has sometimes
been attempted would seem to be
established by the very remarkable
evidence of Mr. W. Faulkener Surgeon
(<cite>Rep.</cite>, p. 125): "He said that
for years he had been in the habit
of supplying magnets for the production
of rapping sounds at spiritual
séances.... Some of these magnets&mdash;as,
for instance, the one he had brought
with him&mdash;were made for concealment
about the person; while others were
constructed with a view to their attachment
to various articles of furniture.... He
had never himself
fitted up a house with these magnets,
and he only knew of one house, Mr.
Addison's, that is so fitted up. He
also stated that he had not supplied
any of these magnets for two or three
years."</p>

<p>As regards the company's predisposition
to believe in spiritualism, I
admit that a sufficient predisposing
reaction against materialism has taken
place, giving room for a man to constitute
what "Sludge" calls</p>

<p>And far stronger than any such
predispositions is the intense and
widespread feeling, so pathetic even
in its uncouthest manifestations, to
which Dr. Edmunds refers (<cite>Rep.</cite>, p.
57): "Prior to the experience gained
in this inquiry, I never realized the
vast hold which the supernatural has
upon mankind. Minds which have
broken away from the commonplace
lines of faith, and thrown overboard
their belief in revealed religion, have
not cast out the longing after immortality."
And I may add, that when
all religious assurance of what the
soul must needs desire is absent, the
longing for some visible, palpable
witness becomes proportionably intenser.
And so just now, from the
very lack of faith, there is an exceptionally
vehement desire that some
one should come with unmistakable
credentials from beyond the grave,
and make us see, and feel, and know
what we cannot help longing for; and
it is difficult to say to what extent
the wish may not be father to the
thought.</p>

<p>I admit that all this constitutes an
adverse momentum of antecedent probability.
But, after all, spiritualists,
as a whole, are not persons who have
given any indications that this yearn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[Pg 625]</a></span>ing
has so wholly overbalanced their
critical faculty as to make them incompetent
witnesses. Moreover, we
have, as witnesses to spiritualistic
phenomena, not merely the spiritualists
proper, but persons who, as regards
the predominance of this sentiment,
are their extremest opposites&mdash;viz.,
the advocates of psychic force.
It must be admitted that these persons
are either without the yearning
for evidence of a future life, or at
least hold it in complete subordination
to the critical faculty.</p>

<p>It may easily be contended that I
have been overrating the progress
and prospects of spiritualism, for that
the public prints as a rule make fun
of it. I may be reminded that Mr.
Browning has exposed it, in the
region of poetry, in his <cite>Sludge the
Medium</cite>; Professor Tyndall in that
of prose, in his delicious account of
a séance, in which he discomfits the
medium and plays spirits himself, to
the great edification of the company,
who rebuke him solemnly for his
want of faith in his own make-believe;
that the keen critics of the
<cite>Saturday</cite> and the <cite>Pall Mall</cite> invariably
treat spiritualism as unmitigated
humbug.</p>

<p>In reply, I point to the <cite>Report</cite>; to
the testimony of an antagonist like
Mr. Geary, as to the number of eminent
men who believe in spiritualism;
to the notorious fact that scientific
men, as a whole, in Germany and
America have ceased to regard spiritualism
as a mere delusion; to the
recent correspondence in the <cite>Times</cite>,
and particularly to the article of
December 26, 1872, wherein the
writer, after reviewing the <cite>Report</cite>, exclaims
that "it is high time competent
hands undertook the unravelling
of this gordian knot. It must
be fairly and patiently unravelled,
and not cut through. The slash of
the Alexandrian blade has been tried
often enough, and has never sufficed.
Scientific men forget that, in the
matter of spiritualism, they must
make themselves fools in order that
they may become wise." The writer
then proceeds to relate how he went
off to examine for himself. He tells
us that he and his friend enter a
room, the furniture of which consisted
of a table and a few cane-bottomed
chairs, which he previously examines;
that in an inner room, during
a dark séance, in which the medium's
hands and feet have been carefully
secured, a chair is lifted up and
thrown upon the table; that afterwards,
in the outer room, "the furniture
became quite lively, and this
in broad daylight; a chair jumped
three or four yards across the carpet,
our hat fell to our feet, and numerous
other phenomena occurred";
but the mediums are free, and he is
nervous about them. In another
séance, the same writer, whilst the
medium's hands and feet are in custody,
has various things thrust into
his hand, and once "felt distinctly
the touch of a large finger and
thumb." Several times during the
séance he takes the opportunity, freely
accorded, of carefully searching
under the table with a lamp. He
confesses there was nothing during
the whole evening, except the phenomena
themselves, to suggest imposture.
"We tried our best to detect
it, but found no trace of it." And
then he ends with "a slash of the
Alexandrian blade," after all, and
suggests that still trickery it must be.</p>

<p>Spiritualism indubitably affords, and
in all probability will continue to
afford, an abundant and legitimate
field for the satirist of human folly,
even when its substantial reality has
been admitted; for it is a condescension
to a great vulgar want,
and its supplies are detailed, for the
most part, through the unwashed fin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</a></span>gers
of very scurvy fellows indeed.
Neither is there anything in the discipline
necessary for the development
of a medium, so far as I know, which
makes his refinement as a class probable.</p>

<p>Educated men are naturally shy
of admitting their connection with
anything involving so much that is
low and disagreeable, except as a
sort of "casual ward" experience;
just as men are usually shy of its
being known that they eat strange
meats, such as rats, out of siege-time.
But once let an heroic rat-eater
come forward, impelled by a sense
of public duty, to tell the world what
a noble viand it is neglecting, when,
lo! it appears, from confessions on this
side and on that, that numbers know
all about it, and have been secretly
indulging in the rat feast. So it is
with spiritualism and its adherents; it
is only now and again that the curtain
is lifted up, and we are enabled
to appreciate the hold which it is
steadily making good on the public
imagination.</p>

<p>As to the line taken by the <cite>Pall
Mall</cite> and the <cite>Saturday</cite>, the question
is whether the critics who write
in these periodicals could, under any
circumstances, adapt their method
and style, I will not say to the support,
but to the fair discussion, of an
uncouth, ill-conditioned, sensational
enthusiasm like spiritualism. As it
was the Crusader's boast that he
never touched the unbeliever save
with the sword, so, it would seem,
some of our critics plume themselves
upon never touching enthusiasm but
with a sneer. Our present school
of critics is the result of a reaction
from the enthusiastic Young England
school of forty years ago, who were
romanticists, patronizing religious enthusiasm
as one of the many forms
of romance. We can hardly expect
that a school which is inclined to regard
all religious sentiment as something
essentially weak and finikin;
which can talk of Joan of Arc as
a "crazy servant-girl,"<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> should be
civil to an exhibition of enthusiasm
much weaker, and vulgar to boot.
Neither do I see how it would be
possible to write a trenchant <em>critique</em>
of such a nondescript medley, except
by treating it as a form of mania.
It admits of no precise scientific
treatment, for it falls under no one
category. Spiritualism, to discuss,
not to banter, would be as uncongenial
a subject for the <cite>Pall Mall</cite>
or the <cite>Saturday</cite> as a case of chronic
bronchitis for a brilliant public operator.</p>

<p>When the "Jupiter" of the latter
days is engaged in duly chronicling,
for the edification of the public,
the splendid spiritualistic phenomena
with which Antichrist will dazzle the
world, should the <cite>Pall Mall</cite> and
<cite>Saturday</cite> still exist, we should not
look for them even then amongst the
enthusiastic crowd. Though employed
in the government interest,
they will surely be allowed to do
their old work in their old way, and
we shall find them engaged in the
congenial task of mocking the last
miracles by which Enoch and Elias
are gathering in the remnant of the
elect.</p>

<p>It may be insisted that the one
effectual way of repressing spiritualism
is to pooh-pooh it. Surely it is
too late; you must give its many
sober adherents some better reason
against trusting their own senses
than its making other people laugh.</p>

<p>Assuredly spiritualism can never
be safely despised until its reality
has been discounted and its author
recognized.</p>

<h3>THE FARM OF MUICERON.</h3>


<p class="center">BY MARIE RHEIL.</p>

<p class="center">FROM THE REVUE DU MONDE CATHOLIQUE.
</p>


<h4>XII.</h4>

<p>The Sunday after the last day of
the harvest, M. le Marquis invited all
the boys up to the château, where a
magnificent banquet was prepared,
and they were expected to remain
until the evening. He ordered a
splendid repast, and music besides;
the principal barn, which ordinarily
was crammed full at this season, but
that, owing to the bad season, was
comparatively empty, was decorated
for the occasion. Our master desired
that nothing should be spared to
make the <i lang="fr">fête</i> a great success. All
the fine linen of the château&mdash;and
the closets were heaping-full of it&mdash;the
china, and silver were put into
requisition, so that there never was
given a more superb banquet to
great personages than to our delighted
villagers. As for the <em>fricassée</em>, it
is remembered to this day; it was
composed, to commence with, of a
dozen kinds of poultry, so well disguised
under different sauces that
one ate chicken in confidence as
chicken, because it was so written on
little strips of paper laid beside each
plate, but without being positive that
it was not turkey or pigeon; and
every one agreed in acknowledging
that such a delicious compound had
never passed down country throats,
and that the wines, if possible, surpassed
the eating; so that the good
fellows commenced to be merry and
perfectly happy when the roast appeared.</p>

<p>Of this roast I will say a word before
passing to other things, for I
fancy you have seldom seen it equalled.
With all respect, imagine a huge
hog, weighing at least a hundred
pounds, roasted whole, beautifully
gilded, and trimmed with ribbons, and
reposing so quietly on a plank covered
with water-cresses you would
have thought him asleep.</p>

<p>It was really a curious and most
appetizing sight, and sufficiently rare
to be remarked; but see how stupid
some people are! On seeing this
superb dish, whose delicious perfume
would have brought the dead back
to life&mdash;that is to say, if they were
hungry&mdash;some of the fellows said
that M. le Marquis might have better
chosen another roast, as pork was
something they ate all through the
year. Whereupon Master Ruinard,
the head-cook of the château, made
a good-natured grimace, and apostrophized
them as a heap of fools, but
without any other sign of displeasure;
and then seizing his big knife, that
he sharpened with a knowing air, he
cut the animal open, and out tumbled
snipe, woodcock, rennets, and partridges,
done to a turn, and of which
each one had his good share. As
for the hog, no one touched it, which
proved two things&mdash;first, that you
must not speak too soon; secondly,
that when a great lord gives an entertainment,
it is always sure to be remarkably
fine.</p>

<p>At the dessert, which was abundant
in pastry, ice-cream, and fresh
and dried fruits, they served a delicate
wine, the color of old straw,
the name of which I don't know exactly,
but which was sweet and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[Pg 628]</a></span>
at all disagreeable. At this time, M.
le Marquis, accompanied by mademoiselle,
Dame Berthe, and Jeannette,
entered and mingled with the guests,
who rose and bowed low. Our good
master thanked the young men for
the great service they had rendered
him; and as he could not drink with
each one, he touched his glass to
that of Jean-Louis, saying it was to
the health of all the commune. They
cried, "Long live M. le Marquis!"
until the roof shook; and as their
heads were as heated as the boilers
at the big yearly wash, they whispered
among themselves that it would
be well to carry Jean-Louis again in
triumph, as much to please the master
as to render justice to him who
was the cause of all this festivity.</p>

<p>Now, our Jean-Louis was the only
one who remained composed after
all this eating and drinking. He
had eaten with good appetite, and
fully quenched his thirst, but not one
mouthful more than was necessary.
He heard all that was said without
appearing to listen; and when others
might have felt vain, he was displeased;
he therefore watched his chance,
slid under the table, and, working his
way like an eel between the legs of
his comrades, who were too busily
occupied to notice him, in three
seconds was out of the door, running
for dear life, for fear of being caught.</p>

<p>He was delighted to breathe the
fresh air, and did not slacken his
pace until he had gone a good quarter
of a league, and was near Muiceron.
Then he stopped to take breath,
laughing aloud at the good trick he
had played.</p>

<p>"Thank goodness!" thought he,
"I have at last escaped. They can
run as fast as they choose now; there
is no chance of catching up with me.
What would M. le Marquis and the
family have thought to have seen
me hoisted up on the shoulders of
those half-tipsy fellows, and paraded
around the court, like a learned beast
on a fair-ground? Not knowing that
I had come to the château only to
oblige the master, who had besides
given me a valuable watch, it would
have looked as though I wished to
receive in vain applause what I refused
in money. None of that, none
of that for me; there is enough nonsense
going on, without my mixing
myself up in it. They can drink and
dance until sunrise to-morrow, if they
so please, it is all the same to me;
and I will go home to bed, after having
told all to my dear mother, who
will not fail to approve of my conduct,
and laugh heartily at my escape."</p>

<p>As he said this to himself, he entered
the wood, of which we have already
spoken, that skirts La Range
and throws its shade nearly to the
fir-trees which surround Muiceron.
It was such a delightful spot, either
by night or day, that it was difficult
to pass through it without feeling a
disposition to loiter and meditate,
particularly for such a dreamer as
Jean-Louis. After all, now that he
was safe, there was nothing to hurry
him home for at least half an hour.
He therefore put his hands in his
pockets, and strolled along, resting
both mind and body in a dreamy
reverie for the benefit of the one, and
walking slowly to the great good of
the other.</p>

<p>Really, the evening was delicious.
The great heat of the day had been
succeeded by a fresh breeze, which,
passing over the orchards around,
brought into the wood the sweet
odor of young fruit, mingled with
that of the foliage and bark of the
trees, damp with the August sap.
The hum of insects was heard, and
not far off the joyous murmur of the
stream leaping over the stones. As
the ground had been thoroughly
soaked for several weeks past, quan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[Pg 629]</a></span>tities
of wild flowers strewed the soil,
and added to the balmy air a taste
of spring, entirely out of season.
You surely must have felt, at some
time or other, how such nights and
such scenes enervate the brain. The
will cannot resist the bewitching influence;
insensibly we become dreamers,
and feel a strong desire to
converse with the stars. August
nights especially are irresistible, and
I imagine no one, unless somebody
depraved by wicked deeds and
thoughts, or a born idiot, can fail
to understand and acknowledge the
effect.</p>

<p>Judge if our Jean-Louis, with his
pure soul and young heart of twenty
years, was happy in the midst of
these gifts of the good God. He
was like a child who hears for the
first time the sound of the bagpipes;
and I beg you will not sneer at this
comparison, for the reveries of an innocent
heart have precisely the same
gentle effect on the soul as the grand
harmonies that roll through vast
cathedrals on the great festivals of
the church.</p>

<p>Doubtless, that he might better
listen to this music, he seated himself
on the moss at the bottom of a
birch-tree, rested his head against
the trunk, and looked up at the
leaves, shaken by the wind, his feet
crossed, and in the most comfortable
position possible, to dream at his ease.
Now, whether he was more fatigued
than he imagined, on account of his
week's hard labor, or whether the
unusual feasting at the château made
him drowsy, certain it is that he first
closed one eye, then both, and ended
by falling as soundly asleep as
though he were in his bed at Muiceron.</p>

<p>It happened that, during this time,
a storm arose behind the hill of
Chaumier, to the right of the river
that runs through the parish of Val-Saint
and Ordonniers&mdash;something
which our sleeper had not foreseen,
although he was very expert in
judging of the weather. Ordinarily,
the river cuts the thunder-clouds, so
that this side of La Range is seldom
injured by storms; but this time it
was not so. At the end of an hour
or two that his sleep lasted, Jean-Louis
was suddenly awakened by a
clap of thunder which nearly deafened
him; and in an instant the rain
commenced to fall in great drops
that came down on his face, and of
which he received the full benefit as
he lay stretched out on the grass.</p>

<p>He rose at a bound, and started
off on a gallop, that his best clothes
might not be injured. Muiceron
was not far distant, and the storm
had just commenced; he therefore
hoped to reach the house in time to
escape it. Not that he thought only
of his costume, like a vain, effeminate
boy, but because his mother Pierrette
was very careful, and did not like to
see his Sunday suit spoiled or spotted
with the rain.</p>

<p>But the storm ran faster than he;
the rain fell as from a great watering-pot
in the trees, lightning glared on
all sides at once, and one would have
said that two thunder-clouds were
warring against each other, trying
to see which could show the greatest
anger.</p>

<p>In the midst of this infernal noise,
Jean-Louis suddenly saw what he
thought, by the flash of lightning, to
be a little brown form trotting before
him in the middle of the path. He
was not a boy to be alarmed by
the raw-head-and-bloody-bones stories
with which we frighten children to
make them behave, and which many
grown-up men, with beards on their
chin, half believe to be true; but,
nevertheless, the thing appeared
quite unusual. He hastened his
steps, and, as sometimes he could see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[Pg 630]</a></span>
in the lightning-glare as well as at
noonday, he soon recognized the
costume of the women of the country,
or at least the cloak they throw
over their clothes when the weather
is threatening.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the kind-hearted Jeannet,
"here is a poor little thing half
frightened to death on account of
the storm. I must catch up with her,
and offer to take her to the village."</p>

<p>For Jean-Louis, although he had
very little ever to do with girls, was
so kindly disposed he was always
ready to be of service to his neighbors,
whether they wore blouses or
petticoats.</p>

<p>But as he hurried on, that he
might put in practice his charitable
thought, there came a flash of lightning
that seemed to set the woods
on fire, and, immediately after, a terrible
clap of thunder as loud as
though the heavens were rent asunder.
Jeannet involuntarily closed
his eyes, and stopped short, fastened
to the ground like a stake. It was
what the <i lang="fr">savants</i> call&mdash;an electric
shock. But don't expect me to explain
that expression, for I know
nothing about it, and, besides, I
don't worry my head about such
things.</p>

<p>When our boy opened his eyes,
after one or two seconds, which appeared
to him very long, his first
care was to explore the path, in order
that he might discover the unknown
country-girl; but there was nowhere
to be seen a trace of a girl, a cloak,
or anything that resembled a human
being.</p>

<p>"Well, this is at least singular,"
said he very uneasily. "Has my sight
grown dim? No; I would stake my
head that I saw before me a flesh-and-bone
woman. I saw it&mdash;that I
am positive and sure. If she has
been hurt by this stroke of lightning,
which must surely have fallen near
here, she must be lying on the ground;
for I have never heard that the storm
kills people by making them melt
like snow under the March sun."</p>

<p>This sudden disappearance excited
him to such a degree that, without
thinking of the rain, which was
pouring down in torrents, and had
drenched his new coat of Vierzon
cloth, he resolved to enter the copse,
at the risk of losing his way, and
search around until he would discover
the lost girl. But before leaving
the beaten path, by a sudden inspiration,
he cried out with a loud
voice:</p>

<p>"If there is any one here who
needs assistance, let her speak. I
will bring two strong arms to the
rescue."</p>

<p>Instantly a faint voice, stifled and
weeping, replied, "Oh! for S. Sylvain's
sake, good people, have mercy
on me!"</p>

<p>"Holy Virgin Mary!" cried Jean-Louis,
"is not that the voice of my
sister Jeannette? She is the last
person for three leagues around I
would have expected to find in such
a plight at this hour of the night.
But I must be mistaken; it can't be
possible."</p>

<p>And with that, more dead than
alive from the violent palpitation of
the heart which suddenly seized
him, Jean-Louis rushed towards a
thicket of young chestnut-trees that
bordered the path, and from which
seemed to come the weak, mournful
voice that implored pity. He pushed
aside the branches with a vigorous
hand, and soon discovered a girl, in
cloak and hood, crouched upon the
ground, and so doubled up in a heap
she could have been mistaken at
first sight for a large ant-heap or
bundle of old rags left there by some
passing beggar.</p>

<p>"For the love of our Lord and
Saviour, tell me who you are, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[Pg 631]</a></span>
don't be afraid of me," said Jeannet,
leaning over the poor little thing.</p>

<p>She raised her head, and instantly
let it fall again on her knees, around
which her hands were clasped; but
as the lightning continued without
ceasing a moment, the movement
sufficed for Jean-Louis to recognize
her.</p>

<p>It was really Jeanne Ragaud, but
so paralyzed with fear, so wet and
fainting, she seemed about to breathe
her last. Her piteous moans were
enough to break one's heart. Her
whole body trembled, and thus huddled
up in the middle of the mud in
the dense underbrush, her situation
was so perilous I verily believe she
would have met her death in that
lonely spot, but for the assistance sent
by Heaven.</p>

<p>"Jeanne, Jeanne!" cried Jean-Louis,
coming close to her, "keep
up your courage, my darling. Rouse
up, I beg of you. Be brave; you are
already chilled through. It is dangerous
to remain in the woods in such a
storm."</p>

<p>But the poor little creature did not
move. The fright and cold of the
terrible tempest had totally bewildered
her. Jeannet vainly shook her by
the shoulders, trying to raise her on
her feet, and to unclasp her hands,
which had stiffened around her knees.
He could not make her change her
position in the least. What could be
done? He did not know precisely
how long she had wandered in the
wood before falling down; and although
he had just heard her speak
a moment before, he feared that she
was about to die, as perhaps she had
been struck by lightning.</p>

<p>He made the sign of the cross, and
invoked the angels of paradise. Immediately
he remembered that not
far from this grove was a miserable
cabin, used by the wood-cutters,
half tumbling down, but still sufficiently
sound to shelter a Christian.
This thought gave him fresh strength;
and taking the little thing, doubled
up as she was, in his arms, he raised
her from the ground, and carried her,
without stopping, to the wretched
hut.</p>

<p>Well was it that he thought of
this retreat, and, still better, that it
was not far distant; for Jeannette, although
slender and not tall, was in
a dead faint, and consequently so
heavy that Jeannet was perfectly exhausted
when he reached the shelter.</p>

<p>By a still greater mercy, he had
his flint in his pocket, and, luckily, it
had not been injured by the dampness.
He thus was able to strike a
light, after having laid the poor girl
on the dry earthen floor. He quickly
lighted some handfuls of brush
and straw that strewed the ground,
and by their smoky light discovered,
in a corner of the cabin, a good moss
mattress, which the wood-men used
when they came to sleep in the
place, and near by a little board, upon
which laid a packet of <em>auribus</em>&mdash;little
resin candles very much used in
our province.</p>

<p>"May God be praised for helping
me!" thought the brave boy, delighted
at having found poor little Jeannette.
"It is a poor bed-room in
comparison with the fine apartments
at the château, but worth a palace
when we think of the thicket just
now."</p>

<p>He unfastened his sister's cloak,
with a thousand respectful precautions,
just as he would have touched
the veil that covers the statue of
Our Lady, and in the same manner
took off her shoes and stockings,
which he found very difficult, as, owing
to the dampness, the fine thread
stockings clung tightly to the skin.
That accomplished, he built up the
fire with all the rubbish he could find,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[Pg 632]</a></span>
and, turning the moss mattress in such
a manner that Jeannette's feet were
in front of the fire, he stretched her
gently upon it, and seated himself
beside her, waiting for her to recover
her senses.</p>

<p>Thus passed half an hour without
the little one stirring; fortunately,
her cloak was very thick, so that the
rest of her clothes were not wet, and
he could thus hope for the best.
But it was the first time Jeannet had
ever watched by the side of a fainting
girl; and, not knowing by experience
what to do in such a case, the
time seemed to him very long before
she revived. He himself was
dripping wet, and, although he scarcely
gave it a thought, he shivered as
one who might soon have the chills-and-fever.</p>

<p>"It would be very queer if I also
should have an inclination to faint;
what then would become of us?"
thought Jean-Louis, who really began
to feel very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>As this idea entered his head, Jeannette
moved her little feet before the
fire, and began to sigh, and then to
yawn, which was the best sign that
there was no danger of dying, as
there is always hope as long as a
sick person can yawn. A minute
afterwards, she raised herself, and
looked around with astonished eyes
that asked an explanation.</p>

<p>"Well," said the happy Jeannet,
"how do you feel, my poor little sister?"</p>

<p>"Is it you?" she asked, still trembling.
"O Jeannet! how frightened
I was."</p>

<p>And as she spoke, she tried to
throw her arms around his neck, like
a child who seeks refuge in his mother's
breast. Jean-Louis drew back&mdash;something
which was entirely different
from his usual manner of receiving
her caresses.</p>

<p>"Are you angry?" said she. "I
have done nothing wrong, except to
venture out to-night to return home;
but the weather was not bad when I
started, and I did not dream of such
a storm."</p>

<p>"I angry? Why should I be?" cried
Jean-Louis, kissing both her hands.
"No, no, my pet; on the contrary, I
am most happy to see you a little restored.
But I am thoroughly drenched
with the rain; that is the reason I
don't wish you to touch me."</p>

<p>"That is true," said she; "I did
not notice it before. What were you
doing before this good fire, instead
of drying yourself?"</p>

<p>"I was looking at you," replied
Jeannet innocently.</p>

<p>"Big goose!" cried the little thing
laughing heartily with her usual good
humor. "Hadn't you any more sense
than that? And now you are just
ready to catch the ague."</p>

<p>"Don't be uneasy, Jeannette; it is
not the first time I have had a check
of perspiration. What I hope is that
you will not suffer by this adventure,
any more than I. But tell me,
why did you run away from the <i lang="fr">fête</i>
at the very moment the dancing was
about to commence?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say why," replied Jeannette.
"Sometimes we have ideas
we must follow, whether or no. It
is as though some one stronger than
we were pushing us by the shoulders
the way he wished us to go. To
speak frankly, I saw you leave hastily,
and I instantly became more
serious, and felt less desire to be
amused. I said to myself, Doubtless
Jeannet, who is better than I, knows
that father and mother are alone
waiting for him at Muiceron, and he
cannot bear the thought of their sitting
up for him until late at night.
And I, what am I doing? Am I
not also a child of the house? Jeannet
will relate all that happened at
the dinner, and they will ask, 'And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[Pg 633]</a></span>
Jeannette?' 'Oh! yes, Jeannette;
does Jeannette think of anything else
but amusing herself and talking nonsense
far away from her parents?'
At these thoughts my heart throbbed
so I nearly burst into tears;
just then mademoiselle was busy
replying to the compliments every
one was offering her; so I left the
barn, and went after my cloak, and,
without further reflection, started for
Muiceron. You know how afraid
I am of thunder and lightning;
when I saw the storm coming up, I
became bewildered, and don't know
which way I went, but I suppose it
was the wrong one. When I regained
what I thought was the right
path, the storm was still raging, and
I would have died of fright, but for
you, my old fellow."</p>

<p>"Thank God you escaped this
time!" said Jean-Louis, very much
touched by the simple recital, which
showed the good heart of the little
girl; "but, nevertheless, you ran a
great risk. Now, Jeannette, let us
hurry home; we must quit this place,
as it must be late."</p>

<p>"I suppose it is," said she.
"Haven't you your watch to see what
time it is?"</p>

<p>"I left it hanging up in my room,"
replied Jeannet. "I did not wish
to wear it when at dinner in the
château, for fear it might look as
though I wished to display it before
those who had none; and it is well
I did not take it, as it would have
been ruined by the rain."</p>

<p>"How can I walk barefooted?"
asked Jeannette. "I can't put on
my wet stockings."</p>

<p>"And your shoes still less," replied
her brother, laughing. "But if you
will let me, Jeannette, I can carry
you."</p>

<p>"Poor Jeannet! Not at all; it
would be too much for you," said
she. "Go to Muiceron, and bring me
my wooden shoes. It is all quiet now
outside; I don't hear any noise, and
I will not be afraid to remain here
alone for a little while."</p>

<p>It was really the best and shortest
way of getting over the difficulty.
Jean-Louis opened the door of the
cabin, and saw that the sky was
clear and bright; not this time with
the lightning's glare, but with the
soft rays of the moon and beautiful
stars of the good God. All was
quiet and peaceful, except that great
drops fell from the trees, still wet
with the heavy rain, and that the
ruts in the road were filled with
water, that made them look like little
rivulets.</p>

<p>"Watch the fire, Jeannette, and be
patient ten minutes," said he; "and
in two strides I will be there and
back again."</p>

<p>It took a little longer time than
that to return, as on entering the
farm he met Ragaud, who was looking
to see if the storm had injured
the palings around the barn-yard,
and was therefore obliged to stop
and in a few words relate the night's
adventure.</p>

<p>The good man, while grumbling
and scolding at the imprudence of
his daughter, who, he said, had no
more sense than a child six years old,
felt fearfully anxious, as was easily
shown by the rapid questions he asked
Jean-Louis. To assure himself that
nothing was kept behind, and that
the boy, from kindness of heart, had
not disguised the truth, he hastily
took down his big woollen scarf from
the hook, and hurried off.</p>

<p>"I will lecture the giddy child
well," said he. "Go before, Jeannet;
I will follow you. It is not far, so
hurry."</p>

<p>"Mother will be anxious," said
Jeannet. "Let me go alone; I will be
back the sooner."</p>

<p>"Your mother has been asleep a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[Pg 634]</a></span>
long time," replied Ragaud, "or else
she would have been on our heels
before this, and we would have had
to carry her back also. Fasten the
bolt, without any noise, and let us be
off."</p>

<p>With that they started. Ragaud
was quick and light for his age, and
they proceeded at a rapid rate, which
soon brought them to their journey's
end. Jean-Louis carried a bright
lantern and a bundle of woollen stockings
and wooden shoes he had taken
at random out of the chest; for it was
all-important that Jeannette's feet
should be well warmed, and that she
should be in her comfortable bed as
soon as possible, so as to prevent
fresh chills.</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight when they
reached the hut, which enables us to
see what a long time had elapsed
since Jean-Louis' flight from the
château, what a good sound sleep
he had had in the wood, and proves
that the storm and Jeannette's swoon
were not slight affairs.</p>

<p>As soon as they entered&mdash;Jeannet
the first, Ragaud behind him&mdash;they
saw that the lantern was a wise precaution.
The heap of brush-wood
was burnt up, and there was no
light, except from a little pile of red
ashes, as even the resin candle glued
to the wall was flickering and falling
in big drops, which announced its
speedy death.</p>

<p>"Here we are, my Jeanne," cried
Jean-Louis from the threshold of the
door. "Father is with me, and we
have brought fresh lights."</p>

<p>No answer. The child was so
weak and faint, it looked as though
she had swooned again. Ragaud,
at this sight, forgot the scolding he
intended giving his daughter by way
of welcome, and, leaning over her,
placed his hand on her forehead,
which was icy cold.</p>

<p>"She is very ill, I tell you," murmured
the good man. "Bring the
lantern here, Jeannet. God have
mercy on me, how pale the poor
child is!... Jeanne, Jeanne, don't
you know us?"</p>

<p>"Ah! yes, my father," she whispered,
looking languidly at him. "I
hear you, but I am so sleepy ...
so sleepy ... I can't talk."</p>

<p>"But you must wake up, and leave
this place," said Ragaud. "Try and
rouse yourself, my child; in five minutes
we will be at the house."</p>

<p>She made the effort, and tried to
stand on her feet; but for Jeannet,
who was near and caught her, she
would have fallen down.</p>

<p>"I am so tired!" she said again,
closing her eyes.</p>

<p>"Shall we carry you on <em>a chair
to see the king</em>?" asked Jean-Louis.
"Perhaps that will be the best way."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said she, smiling at
this remembrance of her childhood;
"that will be fun."</p>

<p>Undoubtedly you know what is <em>a
chair to see the king</em>? It is a child's
play, which generally is done by
three persons&mdash;two boys and a girl;
the boys clasp hands in such a manner
that a good seat is made for the
girl, who thus, without any fatigue to
the bearers, can be carried as easily
as in a carriage.</p>

<p>Ragaud highly approved of the
idea. Jeannet, who thought of everything,
tied the lantern to a piece of
cord, and suspended it to Jeannette's
neck, who recovered enough strength
to laugh; and thus, well lighted and
very happy, they started on their return
to the farm, which they soon
reached safe and sound.</p>

<p>They entered Muiceron by the
kitchen door, so softly that Pierrette,
who was sleeping in the big front
room, did not hear the slightest
noise. Jeannette appeared perfectly
restored; she was gay, although still
pale and shivering; but she assured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[Pg 635]</a></span>
them the warmth of the bed would
soon make her feel better. So they
embraced, and, after many good-nights,
retired to their rooms.</p>

<p>The next morning Ragaud told
Pierrette all the events of the preceding
night, but forbade her entering
Jeannette's room, for fear she might
be awakened too soon after her great
fatigue; but at the same time, unable
to restrain his own curiosity, he took
off his wooden shoes, softly lifted the
latch, walked on tiptoe to the bed,
and peeped between the curtains,
just to see, for a second, how the
child was resting.</p>

<p>Alas! poor Jeannette was sitting
up in bed, her face on fire, her eyes
wandering in delirium, her whole
body burning with fever. She knew
no one. Her excitement was so great
she beat the air with her bare arms,
while her throat was so choked up
the voice was nearly stifled. Ragaud
thought she was dying; he uttered a
loud cry, which brought Pierrette to
the bedside, where the poor mother
fell down, half fainting with grief and
fright.</p>

<p>In an instant the whole farm was
in a tumult. Big Marion set up a
blubbering, crying that the child was
dying; the cow-herds and stable-boys
burst into the room, and, seeing
every one in tears, began to whine
in their turn without exactly knowing
why. Jean-Louis alone, when
he saw his sister's dreadful condition,
did not shed a tear or make a sound,
but, darting out of the room like an
arrow, leaped on a horse's bare back,
and galloped off for the doctor, who
lived half a league beyond Val-Saint,
towards the large town of Preuilly.</p>

<p>By good fortune, he found him at
home, as it was quite early; and,
while explaining the pressing case
that brought him, spied the doctor's
wagon under the shed, and quickly
harnessed to it the horse which he
had ridden, so that, in less time than
it takes to say it, doctor, wagon,
horse, and Jean-Louis were on the
way to Muiceron, and reached there
before any one else had thought
that, before such great lamentation,
no matter what was the trouble, it
would have been better to have run
promptly for assistance.</p>

<p>And here you will excuse me if I
add, by way of advice, that presence
of mind, which is not counted among
the virtues, is one nevertheless, and
not at all to be disdained in the life
of this world; and, therefore, I beg
of you always to keep a good share
in reserve, for I do not doubt you
may soon find use for it, if not to-day,
perhaps to-morrow, and you will always
do well to remember what I
say.</p>


<h4>XIII.</h4>

<p>The doctor, on seeing the room of
the patient filled with people lamenting
from useless tenderness of heart,
instead of doing something for her
relief, began by being very angry.
He was a good man, rather rough
and coarse in manner, but skilful in
his profession, and understood perfectly
how to manage peasants, for
he had always practised in the country,
and was himself of the upper
class of villagers.</p>

<p>"What is such a lot of noisy, lazy
bawlers doing around a sick girl,
who needs air and quiet?" he cried.
"Get out of here, the whole of you,
and don't one dare come within ten
yards. You, Ragaud, can stay if
you choose, but keep as quiet as you
are now, and don't look as if you
were more dead than alive, with your
miserable face a foot long; you,
Mme. Ragaud, stop hugging your
daughter. Let her go; don't you see
you are smothering her? And above
all, don't be dropping your tears on
her face; she don't know you. Jean-Louis,
don't stir from here; you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[Pg 636]</a></span>
reasonable and courageous, and will
be useful to me. And now open the
window, and let out this smell of the
stables brought by those abominable
cow-herds, who ought to have been
driven out with a pitchfork. Good.
Now tell me what has happened to
this child."</p>

<p>All being thus quieted, and the
room purified by the fresh morning
air, which came freely in through the
open window, a slight change for the
better was soon seen in Jeannette.
She let them lay her head on the
pillow, and, although she was still insensible,
her pretty face, crimson and
swollen with the fever, looked less excited.
The doctor counted her pulse
while he listened to the night's adventure,
which was correctly related
by Jean-Louis, as neither the father
nor mother could have put two ideas
together at that particular moment.</p>

<p>"Just as I thought," said the doctor;
"a violent fever brought on by
exposure to the cold, and wet feet.
All the danger is in the head, and I
do not deny that it is very great.
The child has a cerebral fever; do
you understand? Cerebral means <em>of
the brain</em>. Now the brain is the inside
of the head; so the sickness is
there, under this beautiful blonde
hair, which you must instantly cut
off. I hope, Mme. Ragaud, you will
not hesitate to sacrifice your daughter's
hair to save her life?"</p>

<p>"O my God!" cried poor Pierrette,
sobbing. "Do what you please,
my dear doctor; if it would be of any
use to cut off one of my arms, I
would willingly allow it."</p>

<p>"Yes, my good woman, but that
would not help you much, and her
not at all; so keep your arms, we
will need them for something else.
Come, we must relieve her. Jump
in the wagon, Jeannet, and go to the
château, and tell them to send me
some ice, mustard, and other things
that I will write on this slip of paper;
and remember to tell mademoiselle
not to be uneasy, and not to put her
foot in this house short of a week.
While waiting for the return of Jean-Louis,
Mme. Ragaud, draw a bucket
of water from the well, and bring it
to me immediately."</p>

<p>Poor Pierrette obeyed without saying
a word, which was very beautiful
in her; for hearing it announced that
her daughter was ill from cold, the
words ice and well-water confused
her terribly. She had already been
horrified when commanded to open
the window. Indeed, Dr. Aubry
was no fool, as had been well proved
for twenty years; and the best way
was to think that he knew what he
was about, no matter how unreasonable
his words might sound.</p>

<p>Jean-Louis performed his errand
with his usual promptitude; he
brought back what was needed for
the first applications. During his absence,
the doctor had constantly applied
bandages, soaked in very cold
water, to Jeannette's head; but that
was not effective enough, and, as
soon as the ice was brought from the
château, he prepared to use it. It
was the moment to accomplish the
sacrifice of Jeannette's beautiful hair,
which was still dressed as for the
previous night's dance. To tell the
truth, the thick, heavy braids were
enough to weigh down the poor sick
head. Pierrette showed great courage;
she only cared for the relief of
her child. As for the doctor, he
thought no more of cutting off this
splendid hair than of pulling up a
bunch of nettle out of the flower-beds
in his garden.</p>

<p>Ragaud sat as though nailed to his
chair, and seemed neither to hear nor
see anything passing around him. You
would have pitied the poor old man.
But our Jeannet, so brave until
then, could not look on indifferently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[Pg 637]</a></span>
at the murderous play of the scissors
around that dear head, which would so
soon be shorn of its crowning beauty.
As the doctor cut off a tress and
threw it on the floor, as if it were a
noxious weed, he picked it up and
smoothed it with his hand, as
though to repay by caresses the condemnation
it had received. Thus
he soon had all the fair hair in his
hands; and then, as he thought that
soon&mdash;too soon, perhaps&mdash;it might be
the only living vestige of Jeannette,
his courage vanished; he sank on a
chair near the window, hid his face
in the mass of hair, that was still
warm, and sobbed as though his
heart would break....</p>

<p>This touched Dr. Aubry, who was
kind-hearted under his rough exterior.
He never talked sentiment,
being too much accustomed to tears
and lamentations around sick-beds;
but he loved Jeannet, and thought
him more refined and superior in
tone to the surrounding boys. So
he approached the poor child, and,
tapping him on the shoulder, he said
by way of consolation: "Bah! you
big ninny, that will improve her hair;
in one year it will be handsomer and
thicker than ever, and you will have
enough of this to make a hundred
yards of watch-chain."</p>

<p>"In one year!" cried Jean-Louis,
who only heard this word of all the
fine consolation. "Then you don't
think she will die?"</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?
Die? A beautiful young girl of seventeen,
who has always been healthy
and good, don't die from having got
her feet soaked on a stormy night.
Be reasonable, follow my orders,
keep everything around quiet and
fresh, don't fatigue her with words
and embraces when she recovers her
senses, and, with the help of God, I
will answer for her."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Jean-Louis, throwing
his arms around the doctor's neck,
"may Heaven listen to you, M. Aubry!"</p>

<p>These cheering words brought old
Ragaud back to life; big tears rolled
from his dry, fixed eyes, and relieved
him greatly. Pierrette fell on her
knees by the bedside; for, before
thanking the doctor, it was right to
raise her heart to God, who saw further
still than he.</p>

<p>M. Aubry again repeated his orders,
which he always did&mdash;oftener
six times than once with his village
patients; for it must be acknowledged
we are very stupid about
nursing, and, outside of the common
remedies, which are purgatives, emetics,
and quinine to break the fever,
all the rest of the medical gibberish
appears to us very strange, and often
rather contrary to good sense. That
is the reason those who are cured
burn a candle to S. Sylvain. But
for his kind protection, there would
be as many deaths as sick people;
and if you find fault with that expression,
I will tell you that I am
very sorry for it, but that is the way
we talk, and I cannot express myself
differently or more delicately than I
was taught.</p>

<p>The doctor drove off in his wagon,
to which the farm-horse was still
harnessed, and he had the privilege
of keeping it several days, which was
a great convenience to him, as his
own beast was out at pasture. He
took care to pass by Val-Saint,
where he found mademoiselle very
anxious and sad about her god-daughter's
accident. As soon as she
heard it was a serious illness, she
rushed to the bell, crying that she
must have the carriage immediately
to go to her darling; but M. Aubry,
who had his own way with every
one, caught her by the arm.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said he;
"but you are not going there at all."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[Pg 638]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why not?" she asked. "I cannot
stay here without seeing my
Jeanne, when I know she is suffering."</p>

<p>"You shall not go," repeated M.
Aubry firmly. "It would be dangerous
for you; and I am your physician
as well as hers."</p>

<p>"What nonsense!" said mademoiselle,
who, gentle as she was,
did not like him to oppose her. "You
will never make me believe a brain
fever is contagious."</p>

<p>"That is yet to be seen," replied
M. Aubry, who could lie when necessary
as well as any dentist; "and, if
you should get sick, I declare that,
daughter of a marquis as you are, I
would not have the time to take
care of you. At this moment I have
more sick people&mdash;maimed, wounded,
and down with fever&mdash;than I can
manage, and I don't want another
case; without counting that your
château is perched up as high as the
devil, and, to get up here, I would lose
half a day."</p>

<p>"You horrid man!" said mademoiselle,
who could not help smiling,
for she knew the doctor's way, and
never took offence at what he said.
"You talk like a car-driver; but you
are perfectly capable of doing as you
say, so I dare not risk it. But when
can I go?"</p>

<p>"We will see about that; neither
to-morrow nor next day, nor for
several days after. I will come and
bring news of her."</p>

<p>"But how will you find time, with
all your patients?" asked mademoiselle,
delighted to catch the doctor
in a little falsehood.</p>

<p>"You give me the change for my
money," said M. Aubry, laughing in
his turn. "I see you are as malicious
as ever. Well, then, to speak frankly,
it is not the contagion that I fear,
but your chattering and gabbling,
which never stop. If La Ragaudine
recovers, it will depend upon quiet
and repose. Not even the buzzing of
a fly must be heard in her room for
a week; therefore, it would be useless
for you to go there. But now you
can act as you think proper."</p>

<p>"You should have told me this at
first," said mademoiselle. "I will not
go; but promise me you will always
tell the truth about her, and never
conceal any danger."</p>

<p>"My God! no," said the doctor
quietly; "and, to commence, since you
do not wish me to disguise the truth,
I will tell you that, if Jeanne Ragaud
does not recover her senses to-night,
she will be dead to-morrow at twelve
o'clock."</p>

<p>"But you are a monster!" cried
mademoiselle, the tears streaming
from her eyes. "How can you be so
hard-hearted as to tell me such news
without any preparation?"</p>

<p>"There!" said the doctor, "you
are off again. I thought you wished
me to tell you the whole truth."</p>

<p>"My poor Jeanne! Dead to-morrow!"
sobbed mademoiselle.</p>

<p>"One moment&mdash;pay attention to
what I say&mdash;if she does not recover
her senses to-night; but she will, for
she was already a little better before
I left Muiceron."</p>

<p>"Oh! I wish you would go away!"
cried mademoiselle. "I hate to hear
you talk; you will set me wild....
Come now, doctor, speak seriously:
is poor dear Jeannette really in danger?"</p>

<p>"I tell you yes, but I have great
hope. And now I am going away;
you are not angry with me, dear
mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"I will have to forgive you," said
she, giving him her hand; "but know
well that I detest you from the
bottom of my heart, and, when I am
sick, I will send for another doctor."</p>

<p>"Bah! I bet you won't," replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[Pg 639]</a></span>
M. Aubry, perfectly unmoved; "you
are so amiable and gentle when the
fever comes on!"</p>

<p>Mademoiselle laughed through her
tears; she knew from experience it
was not easy to have the last word
with M. Aubry, and she let him go
without further discussion.</p>

<p>The good God showed that he
loved Muiceron. For three days
Jeannette was very ill, after which
her youth and good constitution
overcame the disease. M. Aubry declared
he would answer with his
head for hers, and soon the dear
child recovered strength and color.
But this was the moment to be
careful; for convalescence is very
uncertain and dangerous, they say, in
such a case, and the least imprudence
will suffice to cause a relapse. Therefore
the doctor for ever repeated:</p>

<p>"Attend to what I say; because
she is better, that is no reason to
think she is cured. Don't let her
stir any more than you would let
loose a chicken among the fir-trees;
these affections of the brain are terrible
if there is a relapse."</p>

<p>That word, <em>affections</em>, was another
that Pierrette could not manage to
understand; each time he said it
she was terribly perplexed, and looked
intently at the doctor, to see if he
could not use a more appropriate one
in its place.</p>

<p>"For," thought she, "I see nothing
affectionate in such a wicked
fever that nearly brought my daughter
to the threshold of the grave.
Whoever does or speaks ill is always
called a great enemy; and I don't
think an enemy can ever be affectionate,
or friendly, or anything else of
the sort."</p>

<p>And you will acknowledge the argument
was not bad for a good
countrywoman, who knew nothing
except to read her Mass-prayers by
force of habit.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to inform you
that all the people around were very
much interested in Jeannette's illness;
and if there is a consolation that softens
the bitterness of grief, it is surely
that which is given by friends who
offer to share trouble. Many of the
neighbors were anxious to relieve
Pierrette by taking her place at night;
but you understand that a mother is
always mother, and, unless she had
fallen dead at her daughter's bedside,
she would yield her post to no one.
Happily, the great danger which demanded
such extreme care did not
last long; and as at the end of a week
the fever left Jeannette, and she then
slept tranquilly the greater part of the
night, Pierrette consented to lie down,
without undressing, on a little bed
temporarily placed in the sick-room
by Jean-Louis, and thus was enabled
to obtain some rest.</p>

<p>But many weeks elapsed before
Jeannette was strong enough to resume
her accustomed life; and as she
daily felt herself improving, the great
difficulty was to keep her quiet in
bed, and furnish her amusement, so
that she would not get up too soon,
at the risk of falling ill again; and
here, again, Jean-Louis, with his devotion
and thoughtfulness, provided
a remedy.</p>

<p>Not far off lived a beautiful young
girl, a year or two older than Jeannette,
and the friend of her childhood,
named Solange Luguet, the sister of
Pierre; she was tall, rather thin and
pale, like Jean-Louis, whom she
somewhat resembled in features and
character. This will not astonish
you, as I have already told you they
were first-cousins without knowing
it; and, whether legitimate or illegitimate,
near relatives generally have a
certain family resemblance.</p>

<p>Solange led a retired life, some
said from piety, others from shyness.
She was a skilful seamstress, and em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[Pg 640]</a></span>broidered
beautifully; consequently,
she never wanted work, and passed
her time by her little window, sewing
from morning till night. Jean-Louis
was very fond of her. He often
wished Jeannette's tastes and habits
were as quiet, and he sometimes held
up Solange to her as a model. But
Jeannette's character was entirely
different, and what seemed to Solange
the perfection of happiness would
have been miserably tiresome for her;
nevertheless, the two girls were great
friends, and were always happy to
meet.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, Solange Luguet
whom Jeannet thought of as a
means of distracting Jeannette during
her convalescence. He went to her,
and begged that she would come and
pass several hours every day with
Jeannette. Solange willingly consented,
as she could take her work
with her, and whether she embroidered
at home or at Muiceron was all
the same to her; and, besides, she
could be useful to her friends, especially
Jean-Louis, for whom it was
easy to see she felt a great preference.</p>

<p>Now, Solange, in spite of her reputation
for piety and shyness, was
very lively and bright. The first
day she came to the farm Jeannette
was quite subdued; without saying
it, she was afraid her companion
would be very serious and frown at
the least joke. But it was just the
contrary; Solange amused her so
much with her stories, and gossip&mdash;which
was never ill-natured&mdash;and
songs, that Jeannette never let her
go until she promised to return next
day. This pleasant arrangement
suited everybody. Ragaud and
Jean-Louis gradually resumed their
outdoor work, and Pierrette was less
tied down. We all know that weariness
of mind is the worst of ills, as it
renders one sad, and sadness makes
both body and soul sick: so this little
spoiled Jeannette, who laughed and
chatted from morning till night, recovered
four times as rapidly, thanks
to Solange's agreeable company, and
was soon able to sit up an hour or
two about noon.</p>

<p>Who had caused all this happiness?
Even he who never gave it
a second thought, and to whom it
was so perfectly natural to serve
others that it seemed a part of his
everyday life; for the excellent
Jeannet spoke so seldom of himself,
neither Jeanne nor the Ragauds ever
dreamt of thanking him for having
brought Solange, seeing that they
knew nothing, and simply thought
the Luguet girl came of her own free
will, which certainly she never would
have done, if even the idea had ever
entered her head.</p>

<p>As soon as mademoiselle received
permission, she hastened to Jeannette's
side. Every other day her
beautiful carriage was seen coming
down the road, and, a minute after,
she alighted, accompanied by Dame
Berthe, who always brought a little
basket filled with dainties and delicacies
fitted to tempt an invalid's
stomach.</p>

<p>Poor mademoiselle found the days
very long since Jeanne had left, and
was very impatient for her complete
recovery, that she might carry her
back to the château. She did not
hesitate to express her desire at each
visit before the Ragauds, never remarking
that neither ever replied to
her proposition. The reason was
that Ragaud had received such a
severe shock by the narrow escape
of his daughter, he had promised
and sworn never again to expose the
child to such a fearful risk, which
had so nearly proved fatal. He saw
in this terrible sickness a warning
from the good God; and, as he felt
it in the bottom of his heart, he ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[Pg 641]</a></span>knowledged
in the end that if Jeanne
had not led a life above her position,
nothing like it would have happened.</p>

<p>Between ourselves, mademoiselle,
who was much better informed than
Ragaud, should have even more
clearly understood it. Still further,
as M. le Curé, who you can well imagine
came constantly to Muiceron
since the accident, had been confidentially
told by Ragaud of his good
resolutions, which he highly approved,
and cautiously approached the
subject whenever an opportunity offered
of conversing with mademoiselle.
But "none are so deaf as those
who will not hear," said this good
pastor; "and even without a scene
mischief will come of taking Jeannette
from the château. Her acquaintance
there is too long formed."</p>

<p>It did not happen precisely so.
Jeanne, without scenes or difficulty
with any one, had been forced to
seek refuge under the paternal roof,
and should have remained there until
the present time from her own
free will and accord; but when one
has strayed ever so little from the
right path, it is not easy to return to
it, even when it has not gone as far as
mortal sin; and you will see this
time again that I have strong proofs
to support what I have advanced, as
Jeanne Ragaud had to undergo
severe and bitter trials before she
could entirely give up the half-noble
position she had involuntarily filled,
and resume fully the simple peasant
life.</p>


<h4>XIV.</h4>

<p>One day, when mademoiselle was
making her accustomed visit, after
she had talked and laughed, and
played dinner-party with the fruits
and delicacies she had brought to
Jeannette, she suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>"You are looking admirably, my
child&mdash;as pretty as a picture; your
color is more brilliant than even before
you were sick, and your short
hair, which made me feel so sad the
first time I saw it, is more becoming
than the way in which you formerly
wore it; but you are very badly
dressed. What have you done with
all the dresses I gave you?"</p>

<p>"They are still at the château, godmother,"
replied Jeannet. "I have
not needed them for a long time.
If you will send me some of them, I
will try and look better at your next
visit."</p>

<p>"You are very much thinner, poor
little thing, so that none of them will
fit you; besides, it will be a long while
yet before you can go out. What
you want is a dressing-gown, and I
will have one made for you, if you
will promise me to wear it."</p>

<p>"When you come, I will," answered
Jeannette, who knew well
such a dress did not suit her position,
and that her parents would not
like it.</p>

<p>"No, I wish you to wear what I
will send, and not only when I am
here, but every day; do you understand,
child? I wish it."</p>

<p>"O godmother!" said Jeannette,
"I beg you will not insist upon it;
such a dress is very well at the château,
but here I cannot dress differently
from my mother."</p>

<p>"I do not wish to transform you
into a princess," replied mademoiselle;
"but neither do I like to see
you dressed, as you are, in serge.
I have my own reasons for it."</p>

<p>Jeannette bowed her head, although
at heart she was very much
dissatisfied. Pretty Solange, who
was silently working away in her corner
by the window, gave her an encouraging
glance, to keep her firm
in her good resolution; but for ten
years Jeannette had given in to all
her godmother's whims and caprices,
and dared not answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[Pg 642]</a></span></p>

<p>Two days afterwards, a large bandbox,
directed to Jeannette, was
brought to Muiceron. She was still
in bed, and was quite curious until it
was opened; and there was the promised
dress, made of beautiful blue
cashmere, so fine and soft it looked
like silk. As to how it was made, I
really cannot describe it; but it is
enough to know that mademoiselle
herself could have worn it without
impropriety, so that it can easily be
understood it was not suitable for
Jeanne Ragaud.</p>

<p>"Isn't it beautiful?" exclaimed
Jeannette, admiring the dress, fit for
a marchioness. "But I will never
wear it; do you think I should,
Solange?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed," said Solange.
"Don't do it for the world, Jeannette;
it would be very wrong for you
to wear it, and the neighbors would
laugh at you."</p>

<p>"Help me to get up," replied
Jeanne. "It will be no harm to try
it on once; it will amuse us. Can
I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to be sure," said good Solange;
"I should like to see you for
once dressed as you were at the
château."</p>

<p>Jeannette jumped quickly out of
bed, and Solange, to amuse her,
brushed her short hair in such a way
that she looked like a little angel;
then she put on some fine white petticoats,
and, last of all, the beautiful
robe, which fitted her splendidly.
Thus dressed, Jeannette was one of
the prettiest young ladies you can
imagine; and I rather think she
looked at herself in the mirror with
great satisfaction.</p>

<p>She sat down in the big arm-chair
her godmother had sent her from the
château as soon as she was convalescent,
and it was easy to see she
was not ill at ease in her beautiful
present, but that, on the contrary,
was infinitely satisfied, and not at all
anxious to take it off.</p>

<p>However, she feared the arrival
of her parents, and did not wish
them to see her in such a costume.
Solange, from the same thought, had
not resumed her work, and remained
standing before her, ready to undress
her. You see the will was good,
but the devil was upon the watch.
At the very moment that Jeannette,
with a little sigh of regret,
was about to put off her gay trappings
and don her peasant dress, the
big white horses of mademoiselle
were heard pawing the ground in the
yard.</p>

<p>"It is my godmother!" said Jeannette,
blushing. "Well, I am not
sorry; she will see that I do honor to
her present."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle entered immediately
after, and, seeing Jeannette so pretty
and so stylish in her beautiful
dress, kissed her heartily, and loaded
her with praises.</p>

<p>"You are perfectly lovely," said
she; "and for the penalty, I have
prepared a great surprise. There is
a handsome gentleman, who has
come with me, and wishes very much
to see you."</p>

<p>"Will you please tell me who it
is?" asked Jeannette.</p>

<p>"No; I wish to see if you will
recognize him. Come in, Isidore,"
cried mademoiselle to some one
who was waiting outside the door.</p>

<p>The said Isidore immediately appeared&mdash;a
tall young man, well made,
and dressed in the latest Parisian
style. His hair was elaborately curled,
and his cravat, gloves, and shoes
were so elegant he looked as though
he had just been taken out of a
bandbox. He made a low bow to
Jeannette, and paid her a compliment
such as we read in books.</p>

<p>Jeannette, much amazed, rose without
speaking, and, as her astonished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[Pg 643]</a></span>
look showed she did not recognize
him in the least, mademoiselle laughingly
relieved her embarrassment.</p>

<p>"What!" said she, "you don't
remember Isidore Perdreau, the son
of Master Perdreau, my father's notary,
and the playmate of your childhood?"</p>

<p>"You must excuse me," said
Jeanne, "but he is so much changed."</p>

<p>"In size, perhaps," said M. Isidore,
"but not in beauty, as you most certainly
are."</p>

<p>"He has returned from Paris, and
will in future live at Val-Saint. It
is very good in him," said mademoiselle,
"for his life will be very different;
but his father wishes to associate
him with himself in business."</p>

<p>"To all true hearts one's native
place is dear," replied M. Isidore,
placing his hand on his waistcoat.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember the young
girl by Jeannette?" asked mademoiselle.</p>

<p>"Not precisely," he replied.</p>

<p>"I am the sister of Pierre Luguet,
with whom you used to go hunting
for blackbirds."</p>

<p>"Pierre Luguet? Ah! yes, little
Pierre; and where is he now?"</p>

<p>"Always in the same place," replied
Solange, without stirring.</p>

<p>M. Isidore did not condescend to
continue the conversation with one
so little disposed to talk, and, turning
towards Jeanne, lavished upon her
some more foolish compliments,
which, without being exactly to the
taste of the child, were not displeasing
to her vanity.</p>

<p>It was evident that mademoiselle
encouraged Isidore, and thought him
very charming. It was not because
she was wanting in sense or penetration,
but the custom of living alone
in her big château, where she rarely
saw any one but country people, and
the new distraction of carrying out a
plot that she had concocted, and
which you will soon guess, made her
see things dimly; and whilst Solange,
simple girl as she was, saw at the
first glance that young Perdreau had
become an insolent, ridiculous fop,
this high-born young lady, who had
read so many books, was ready to
faint at the least word of that simpleton&mdash;for
simpleton was the name
he well deserved until after-circumstances
proved that he was worthy of
a still more odious title.</p>

<p>Dame Berthe behaved just like her
mistress; but, as the good creature
had scarcely any common sense, that
can very easily be understood. Isidore,
since his return three days before,
had never ceased to flatter
her and relate long stories about
Paris, principally his own inventions,
but to which, nevertheless, the old
governess, with eyes, ears, and mouth
wide open, listened with devoted attention.
So, when Solange showed
such coldness to her old school-fellow,
mademoiselle looked at her
with anything but a gentle expression,
and Dame Berthe instantly
shrugged her shoulders and made
big eyes at her.</p>

<p>But Solange remained perfectly indifferent;
in the first place, because
her back was turned to the ladies,
and, secondly, because she worked
away as though she expected to be
paid a franc an hour.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Pierrette and Ragaud
came back from the pool Saint-Jean,
where they had commenced to soak
the hemp, and Jean-Louis soon followed.
When they saw such fine
company in the room, they all three
stopped, rather ashamed of their
working-clothes, which was doubtless
the reason they did not observe
that Jeannet, in her elegant costume,
was a great contrast to them.</p>

<p>Ragaud, as you already know, was
rather given to vain-glory, and his
vanity was easily tickled. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[Pg 644]</a></span>
the only defect of this good man, but
it must be acknowledged this defect
clung to his heart as a tree is tied
by its root to the ground; so that
in Isidore Perdreau he only saw the
favorable side&mdash;to wit, a young man,
brought up in the capital, very rich
and handsome, who could be received
in the best houses, and who
did not disdain to hasten to greet
old friends so far beneath him. Pierrette,
without further reasoning, was
very sensible of what she likewise
considered a great honor. So the
excellent couple, whose honest souls
were rather stupefied for the moment,
quite overwhelmed Perdreau
with the warmth of their reception,
and pressed him so earnestly to repeat
his visit you would really have
thought they were welcoming the return
of their own son.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle was in a gale of delight,
and, when she re-entered the
carriage with her attendants, the
lackeys' faces were in a broad grin
at seeing her so gay, and even the
horses made two or three little jumps
on starting, as though they, too, participated
in the good-humor of their
mistress.</p>

<p>"Well, what did I tell you?" asked
mademoiselle of Isidore, who was
seated opposite to her. "Is she pretty
enough, well-bred enough? And, in
spite of all your Parisian acquaintances,
do you think she is a woman
to be scorned?"</p>

<p>"O mademoiselle!" cried Perdreau,
"she is adorable, delightful!
But you brought her up; isn't that
enough?"</p>

<p>"She will make a lovely bride,"
said mademoiselle; "and it will be
the happiest day of my life when I
shall see you both leave the church
arm-in-arm."</p>

<p>"How becoming the wreath of
orange-blossoms will be to her!"
cried Dame Berthe.</p>

<p>"But will she have me?" asked
Isidore in a hypocritical tone.</p>

<p>"Bah! be assured she will be
most happy, and her parents immensely
honored," replied mademoiselle;
"besides, I have only to say a
word, as you know."</p>

<p>"You are an angel!" said M.
Perdreau, as he kissed mademoiselle's
hand; "and if I had not seen you
again before Jeanne Ragaud, my
happiness would make me crazy. I
can only say that you are the most
beautiful and graceful woman in the
world, and she is the second."</p>

<p>Poor mademoiselle, who was humpbacked
and anything but handsome,
and, besides, nearly thirty, smiled
nevertheless at this insolent speech,
so out of place from the mouth of
her notary's son; so true is it that
compliments are swallowed as easily
as ripe strawberries, no matter how
false they may be, if the mind is not
properly balanced, and cannot rise
above the frivolity and nonsense
heard on all sides in this world.</p>

<p>While the carriage rolled away to
the château, each one at the farm
had something to say, and Perdreau
was there, also, the subject of conversation.</p>

<p>"He is a very pleasant fellow,"
said good Ragaud, "not at all proud,
and much better-looking than when
he left home. He must have studied
very hard in Paris, and his dear,
good father will have a worthy successor."</p>

<p>"When I think," replied Pierrette,
"how readily he accepted your invitation
to supper, never raising the
slightest difficulty, that proves he
has a good heart."</p>

<p>"We won't know what to say to
him," remarked Jeannette, "he is so
much more learned than we."</p>

<p>"Yes, but very simple with it all,"
said Pierrette. "I will not be the
least embarrassed. I am sure he will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[Pg 645]</a></span>
like to talk over all his boyish tricks
and adventures&mdash;how he stole apples
from Cotentin's garden, and how
he would keep M. le Curé waiting
when it was his turn to be altar-boy."</p>

<p>"He was always full of fun," replied
Ragaud, "and is so still; but
that is no defect."</p>

<p>"Oh! certainly not," cried Jeannette.</p>

<p>"For what evening have you invited
him?" asked Jean-Louis, who
had not yet expressed an opinion.</p>

<p>"Next Sunday," said Ragaud;
"that will not take us from our work,
and we can bring him back with us in
the wagon after Vespers."</p>

<p>"What a beautiful dress you have
on!" said Jeannet, looking at his sister.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle gave it to me,"
she replied, looking down. "I put
it on to receive her; but I will not
wear it again."</p>

<p>"Until Sunday?" asked Jean-Louis.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Pierrette, "Jeannette
must be prettily dressed in
honor of Isidore."</p>

<p>Jean-Louis said nothing; he walked
to the window where Solange was
sitting, and leaned on the back of her
chair, apparently absorbed in watching
her embroider.</p>

<p>"Jeannet," said Solange, without
raising her eyes, "what do you think
of all this?"</p>

<p>"It makes me sad," he replied.</p>

<p>"You have reason to feel so," said
she. "That smooth-tongued Isidore
has turned all their heads. Mademoiselle
is even more carried away than
the others; and, from the way things
are going on, there will be trouble
before long."</p>

<p>Jean-Louis sighed. As they had
spoken in a low tone, and the Ragauds
were conversing with Jeannette,
their little conversation had not been
remarked.</p>

<p>"Will you go home with us after
Mass next Sunday?" continued Solange.
"Pierre will be glad to see
you, and Michou has promised to
dine with us at noon, and taste our
boiled corn."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Jeannet, "I
will go with pleasure."</p>

<p>This was on Tuesday; the four
following days Isidore Perdreau
came constantly to Muiceron, sometimes
with mademoiselle, sometimes
alone, and was most cordially received
by the Ragauds, and Jeannette
also, I regret to say.</p>

<p>If you are of my opinion, you will
allow that nothing is pleasanter than
to listen to a story when there is
only question of good people and
happy events. It makes our hearts
glad, and we forget for a little while
that life is like the clouds in the sky,
streaked with white, gray, and black,
and that often the dark clouds overshadow
the light; but as truth must
be loved above all, I am very sorry
to tell you that for the present I
have nothing good to relate. You
must pardon me, then, if I am obliged
to sadden you by the recital of
sinful and criminal acts, and believe
me that, if it is painful for you to
have to listen to them, it is not less
so for me to recount them to you.</p>

<p>When mademoiselle once became
possessed with the charming idea of
marrying her god-daughter to Isidore,
never was the caprice of a woman
without occupation more obstinately
pursued and more firmly fastened in
the very bottom of her brain. Very
true, she only sought the happiness
of her beloved Jeannette, and thought
she had thereby secured it. She incessantly
repeated to Dame Berthe
that it would be the greatest misfortune
if Jeannette should marry a
peasant, that after all the care she had
lavished upon her for ten years
she could not bear to see her milking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[Pg 646]</a></span>
the cows, and hardening her hands
by washing and working in the
fields. On the other side, she would
not risk the happiness of her pet by
marrying her to a man she did not
know; consequently, she should marry
some one in the neighborhood;
and Isidore was the only person
around who united all the requisites
desired by mademoiselle, as the
other young men were only of the
laboring class. She communicated
her idea to M. le Marquis, who, without
making any objections, thought
the project might be attempted.
He himself went to see M. Perdreau,
the father, and announced to him
his wishes upon the subject, and Isidore
was immediately recalled from
Paris.</p>

<p>Old Perdreau, the notary, passed
for one of the most honest men in
his profession. For thirty years
M. le Marquis had closed his eyes
and left him the entire control of his
affairs, which, truth to say, were not
very complicated, as the principal
wealth of the château consisted of
fertile land, woods, meadows, and
vineyards, the revenues of which he
received and controlled.</p>

<p>More than that&mdash;and this was the
worst&mdash;our master made him the
special confidant of his most secret
expeditions. Thus, when he left
home on one of his mysterious journeys,
where he expected to encounter
great dangers, Perdreau alone knew
exactly the hiding-places of M. le
Marquis, the plots that were there
concocted&mdash;in a word, the great conspiracies
that monsieur and his
friends thought legitimate in their
souls and consciences, although they
could scarcely be called such in my
opinion.</p>

<p>This was very astonishing, it must
be acknowledged, as it bound M. le
Marquis hand and foot to his notary.
But what could you expect? My
late beloved father, who had been
an enthusiastic <em>Chouan</em>, contrary to
most of the people of his province,
who did not care a fig for all that
fuss, said that perfectly honest souls
can never think ill of any one, and
that is the reason they are often
duped and vilified without their even
dreaming of it.</p>

<p>For it is time to let you know that
Master Perdreau, the notary of Val-Saint,
was, and had been always, the
most cunning rascal, not only of our
neighborhood, but of the whole
country for twenty leagues around,
including all the towns, little and big.
His only idea was to make money,
and for that he would have sold his
master, his conscience&mdash;in case he
had one&mdash;his best friends, his soul,
and even the sacred vessels of the
tabernacle. In the way of hypocrisy,
deep wickedness, theft, stinginess,
and falsehood he had nothing to
fear from any rival, saving, perhaps,
his only son, Isidore, who was rapidly
learning to play the knave, and
promised, with the help of the devil,
to become very soon the true pendant
of monsieur, his father.</p>

<p>In order to perfect this shameful
education, Isidore had finished his
studies in Paris, and Master Perdreau,
I need not say, had chosen a college
for him where he would neither
learn virtue nor the fear of God.</p>

<p>For the consolation of good people,
evil-doers seldom profit by their
crimes. Thus, at this period of our
story, Master Perdreau was on the
eve of reaping the fruits of thirty
years of criminal conduct, and it was
precisely the opposite of what he had
sought all his life that was about to
happen to him.</p>

<p>Holding in his hand the secrets
of M. le Marquis, he had used them
to obtain large sums from the poor
deluded man, under the pretence of
advancing his interests; and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[Pg 647]</a></span>
this money, added to other thefts, he
had first supplied his son with means
for continuing his dissipation in Paris,
and then speculated so often and so
well in a place not very Christian&mdash;called,
I believe, the Exchange&mdash;that
he had nothing left he could call his
own but his little country office and
debts enough to drive him crazy.
Judge, then, if he thought himself
favored by fortune when M. le Marquis
came and proposed Jeanne Ragaud
to him for daughter-in-law.
Never did a drowning man grasp
more eagerly at the plank held out
to keep him from death. The girl's
fortune was well known. Muiceron
and the adjoining property was worth
at least one hundred thousand francs;
and to rightly estimate the money
good Ragaud laid by every year, one
would have to count on his fingers a
tolerably long while. Further, Jeannette
was an extremely pretty girl,
brought up as a young lady, and
there was no doubt her godmother
would leave her&mdash;perhaps might give
her at her marriage&mdash;a very handsome
present. All being thus arranged
to the satisfaction of this scoundrel
of a notary, he had only to rub
his hands and chuckle at the idea
of having fooled everybody during
his whole life.</p>

<p>I will not sadden you by relating
what was the conversation on the
subject between father and son on
the evening of Isidore's arrival in the
village, and the means which they
proposed to accomplish their ends,
which was to wheedle old Ragaud
into giving up all the property to his
daughter, only reserving for himself
a modest annuity. As for the shameful
way in which these arrant swindlers
held up to ridicule M. le Marquis,
whom they called "old fool," and
mademoiselle, whom they stigmatized
as the "yellow dwarf," on account
of her crooked figure, it would
make me sick to relate all they
said. However, in saying that Perdreau
deceived everybody, I have
rather exaggerated, for two men in the
village saw through his villany, and,
thank God, they were two of the
most worthy&mdash;namely, Jacques Michou,
and our dear, holy <i lang="fr">curé</i>. The
first, who, as you know, had never
been drawn into the promising conspiracies
of his good lord, had always
suspected Perdreau for catching so
readily at the alluring bait. He had
watched him closely, and, to fully unravel
his plans, pretended to become
very intimate with M. Riponin, the
steward, who was scarcely any better
than the notary, but who owed Perdreau
a grudge for his having duped
him in some knavish trick they undertook
together. Since then, Michou,
who knew how to play one
against the other, in order to serve his
master, made one thief steal from the
other, and fully succeeded in his design.
As for our <i lang="fr">curé</i>, he knew both
the good and the bad, and looked
out for a squall. The great misfortune
was that mademoiselle was so
fully possessed with her idea of the
marriage she neglected to consult
him and ask his advice.</p>

<p>Alas! I am bound now to avow
that poor little Jeannette, whose sin
was more of the head than the heart,
allowed herself to be very quickly
caught in the net held out to her.
Never did a giddy, inconstant little
fish make the leap as willingly as
she. In a village marriages are
soon arranged. The parties are supposed
to be well acquainted. At the
first proposition, when the interests
agree, they have only to say yes;
and so it happened no later than the
second Sunday after the arrival of
Isidore Perdreau.</p>

<p>Every one assisted to hurry up the
affair with lightning speed. Jeanne
solemnly believed all the nonsense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[Pg 648]</a></span>
poured into her ear by Isidore,
thought herself adored by him, and
regarded him as infinitely superior to
all other men in style, manner, and
fine speeches. Ragaud and Pierrette
were puffed up with pride; monsieur
and mademoiselle did not conceal
their satisfaction; and the people
around, with the sole exception of
Michou, who was looked upon as a
cross, peevish old fellow, hastened to
congratulate the fortunate couple.</p>

<p>Sickness was no longer thought of.
Jeannette, happy and triumphant,
rapidly regained her strength. The
poor silly child only thought of her
new dresses and of the promised
visit to Paris after her marriage, the
delights of which Isidore dwelt upon
in glowing terms, which would have
turned a stronger head than hers.
Never, in fact, did a family rush blindfolded
and more willingly into a bottomless
abyss.</p>

<p>However, there was one person at
Muiceron whose presence tormented
M. Isidore, and whom he had hated
from the first day. You can guess
it was Jean-Louis. Each time that
he entered the house and saw that
tall figure, the face pale and serious,
silently seated in a corner, the only
one who did not receive him with
joy, his eyes flashed with anger, and
he would turn his back on him in
the most contemptuous manner&mdash;something
which the Ragauds would
certainly have resented in any one
else; but the poor people were so
bewitched they were unjust enough
to be angry with Jean-Louis, and
even to fancy that he was jealous,
whilst he was only very properly
grieved at what had happened.</p>

<p>His life had become very different.
No more friendly talks, no more
watching for him, no more tender
caresses; not that they had ceased to
love him, but there was no time for
these innocent family recreations,
and, besides, it would have embarrassed
them to make a display of affection
before M. Isidore, who thought
all such country performances beneath
him. Poor Jean-Louis, who
for so many years had always entered
Muiceron with joyful heart at the
thought of embracing his dear mother,
now came in with sad and troubled
brow. Pierrette always appeared
busy and worried. She would rapidly
say "good-evening" in reply to Jeannet's
gentle salutation whispered in her
ear, and immediately go on with her
work; for there were always sauce-pans
to overlook, or orders to give to
Marion, who was not the least bewildered
of them all. As for Jeannette,
the cold manner in which Jean-Louis
always treated her intended,
and, above all, the wicked insinuations
Isidore made against him, aroused
her displeasure; and, if Pierrette was
always absorbed in her household
cares, Jeannette pained him still more
by her frigid manner, bordering on
sullenness.</p>

<p>Jean-Louis felt all this most keenly.
He was not a person who liked to
complain or ask explanations; besides,
what would he have gained by
it? He knew too well the reason of
their conduct to be obliged to ask
why. In a moment he could have
changed all by appearing as delighted
as the rest; but that was precisely
what he would not do. In truth,
when we see those we love at the
point of drowning, how can we applaud?</p>

<p>Still worse was it when the family
circle of Muiceron was increased by
the presence of old Perdreau, who
nearly every evening showed his
weasel-face at the table, and drank
with great friendliness to the health
of the good people whose ruin he
was mercilessly plotting. Jean-Louis
two or three times bore it patiently;
then he felt he could take himself off,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[Pg 649]</a></span>
and be missed by no one; so one
fine evening he mustered up courage,
left the farm before supper, and went
off to the house of his friends, the
Luguets.</p>

<p>As usual, he found the little house
quiet, clean, and shining with neatness.
Pierre was reading aloud the
life of a saint, while Solange, always
employed, was sewing by the lamp.
Their old parents and Jacques Michou,
seated around the fire, listened
in silence, and the dog lay snoring
on the warm hearth-stones. Jeannet
on entering motioned with his hand
for them not to stir, and seated himself
by Solange, who nodded to him.</p>

<p>"My friends," said Jean-Louis
when the reading was over, "I have
come to ask for my supper this evening,
and perhaps I may again to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Whenever you please, my boy,"
said Luguet.</p>

<p>"Things don't please you at Muiceron,
eh?" asked Michou.</p>

<p>"Ah!" replied Jeannet sadly,
"perhaps I am unjust and wrong;
but I cannot bring myself to help in
that marriage."</p>

<p>"What difference does it make to
you?" said Pierre; "when people are
possessed, they will do as they please.
You are too sensitive, Jean; after all,
you will not have to marry Perdreau."</p>

<p>"I am so sure," replied Jeannet,
"that poor child will be unhappy."</p>

<p>"No one forces her!" said Pierre.
"She wishes it, so do the Ragauds,
so do M. le Marquis and mademoiselle.
All agree; well, then, let them
run the risk!"</p>

<p>"Be still, Pierre," said Solange;
"you speak as though you had no
heart. Remember that Jeannette has
been from her infancy like a sister to
Jean-Louis; would you like to see
me marry Isidore?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Pierre, "I would
sooner cut his throat; but you are
not like Jeannette."</p>

<p>"Don't say anything against her,"
replied good Solange with warmth.
"She is the best girl in the world;
and because her head is rather light
and giddy, that does not prevent her
having an excellent heart. I understand
Jean-Louis' feelings, for, certainly,
Isidore Perdreau's reputation
is not very good. But who knows?
Perhaps, when he is married and settles
down, he may make Jeannette a
good husband."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Solange," said Jeannet,
taking her hand, "it is so kind in
you to defend her; it makes me feel
happy. If I could only show a little
friendship for Isidore, I think I would
be less miserable; but I cannot conquer
myself; I cannot change...."</p>

<p>"It is not worth while trying to do
it, boy," said Michou; "when we see
misfortune coming, and cannot prevent
it, the best we can do is to keep
at a distance, and not meddle."</p>

<p>"Then, M. Michou, you really
think trouble will come of it?" asked
Jeannet.</p>

<p>"Yes, my son, such overwhelming
trouble," answered the game-keeper,
"that until the day I see
them standing before the mayor
and the <i lang="fr">curé</i>, I shall hope the good
God will work a miracle to prevent
it. The Ragauds at present are like
men who have taken too much
brandy&mdash;that is to say, they are as
tipsy as a beggar after the vintage.
They can neither hear nor understand.
But mind what I say; you
others who are in your senses. I will
tell you what sort of men they are,
that infamous notary and his rascal
of a son, and then you will see
whether Jean-Louis is right or wrong."</p>

<p>Thereupon he recounted to his
astonished friends what we already
know, but went into greater details
than I have thought necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[Pg 650]</a></span></p>

<p>"We can only pray to God," said
Solange when he had ended. "Alas!
poor Jeannette, what will become of
her? M. Michou, you must warn the
Ragauds."</p>

<p>"You think that would be easy?"
said Michou. "In the first place,
they would not believe me. Monsieur
and mademoiselle would be indignant.
The Perdreaux are too thorough
scoundrels not to have at hand a
crowd of proofs and protestations
which would make them appear as
white as snow. Every one is against
us, up to that obstinate Jeannette,
who is dead in love with Isidore, so
they say&mdash;hare-brained little fool!"</p>

<p>"It is only too true," said Jeannet,
much overcome.</p>

<p>"As for you," resumed Michou,
"in consequence of your peculiar
position, you can say less than any
one else; but if I were in your place,
I would not remain an indifferent
spectator of such a sad affair."</p>

<p>"What can I do?" said Jeannet.
"How can I abandon them?"</p>

<p>"Come and stay with me a while.
I am clearing a part of the wood;
you can overlook the workmen, and
we can manage to keep house with
Barbette, if you are not very difficult
to please about the cooking."</p>

<p>"Oh! I would like it very much, M.
Michou, and you will do me a great
favor. But I must ask my father
about it; will you see him, and get
his consent?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow we will have it all
arranged," replied Michou.</p>

<p>"Jeannet," said Solange, "the
wood of Val-Saint is not very far
from here; when your day's work is
over, you must remember there is
always a place at our table for a
friend. Come, and we will console
you. Don't worry yourself too much
about all this affair; often the storm
is so terrible we expect every moment
to be struck with lightning, and
then the clouds break, the sky clears,
and, after all the fright, nobody is
killed."</p>

<p>Jean-Louis, notwithstanding his
sadness, could not help smiling at
these hopeful words, spoken by this
good and beautiful girl, so reasonable
in all things, and still always so
cheerful. He pressed her hand, and
helped her set the table for supper.
Michou, reflecting on these words of
Solange, wisely remarked that the
future being in the hands of God,
who always concealed it from us
through mercy or to grant us agreeable
surprises, it was unbecoming in
us to torment ourselves too much
about it.</p>

<p>At which speech good Pierre, who
never liked trouble, loudly applauded;
and then, the repast being served,
all sat down to table, and, while eating,
conversed on various topics not the
least connected with Muiceron.</p>


<h4>XV.</h4>

<p>According to his promise, Michou
the next day paid an early
visit to the Ragauds, accompanied
by his old blackened pipe, which he
always kept firmly between his teeth
when he feared he might become
impatient or angry in conversation.
He said that, without it, the big
words would rush out of his mouth
before he had time to prevent them;
but that, with it, while he smoked,
shook it, or relighted it, he regained
his composure, and gathered time to
arrange his ideas. And never was
<em>puffer</em>&mdash;as he called his pipe&mdash;more
necessary than on this visit to Muiceron.
Seeing his friends on the
point of throwing themselves into
the enemy's clutches, and knowing
that remonstrance would avail nothing,
he felt that anger and sorrow
might carry him to any extremity&mdash;in
words only, let it be well understood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[Pg 651]</a></span></p>

<p>He found Ragaud seated before
the door, shelling gray peas, while
Pierrette was washing dishes; for,
since she had commenced to feed
the Perdreaux, all the crockery was
in use, and they went to bed so late
half the work remained for next day.</p>

<p>"I wish you good-morning," said
Michou to his friends. "I see you
are very busy, but I have only come
to remain a few moments."</p>

<p>"Come in," said Pierrette.</p>

<p>"No, I prefer to remain outside,"
replied Michou. "I like the fresh air.
Ragaud, do you feel inclined to do
me a favor?"</p>

<p>"What a question!" said the good
man. "I am always ready for that,
my old friend."</p>

<p>"Thank you, it is not a very great
request. Can you spare me Jean-Louis
for a fortnight? I have twenty
men at work in the wood of Montreux,
and no one to oversee them.
The young fellow can help me a
great deal."</p>

<p>"Very willingly," said Ragaud;
"the hemp is nearly ready, and I do
not want Jeannet just now."</p>

<p>"He will take his meals with me,"
replied Michou, "and sleep at my
house the nights. He will be obliged
to work late; so you need not be
uneasy if he does not return home
sometimes."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said Ragaud. "Do
you employ the wood-cutters of the
neighborhood?"</p>

<p>"Deuce take it, no!" replied
Michou. "I hire them right and
left, and truly they are the stupidest
asses. The way they talk makes
one's hair stand up under his cap."</p>

<p>"Bah! what do they say?"</p>

<p>"Devilish nonsense! Why, they
talk of nothing but revolution, overthrowing
everything and everybody,
massacring the nobility, and theft.
I remember how my father, long ago,
told me about the people before the
Reign of Terror, and I imagine these
men must be something of the same
stamp. Some of them disappear sometimes;
when they return, they speak
in whispers, and, when I order them to
go to work, you should see the way
they glare at me. It is very well I
don't know what fear means; but, reinforced
by Jeannet, all will go well."</p>

<p>"Take him right away," said Ragaud;
"and if he is not enough, well,
send for me; I will give you a helping
hand."</p>

<p>"You?" replied Michou, who
commenced to mumble over his pipe.
"You are too busy in this house with
the wedding."</p>

<p>"Oh! it is not going to be to-morrow,"
said Ragaud; "the day of betrothal
is not yet fixed. I leave all
that to good M. Perdreau. He is taking
a great deal of trouble; and I am
glad he is, for I know precious little
about legal matters."</p>

<p>"So, then, you don't bother yourself
with anything?&mdash;very pretty conduct
on your part."</p>

<p>"What should I do?" asked Ragaud
innocently. "Each one has
his part to play. M. Perdreau was
brought up among books, and I at
the plough. When he has the papers
ready, he will tell me where to
sign my name."</p>

<p>"And you will sign it?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly, after he has read
them to me."</p>

<p>"All very nice," said Michou. "If
I were in your place, I would sign
without reading them; it would be
more stupid...."</p>

<p>"What do you say?" asked Ragaud.</p>

<p>"I say," replied Jacques, "if you
will allow me to offer a word of advice,
you will not only make them
read your daughter's marriage contract
to you, but also have it read
to others&mdash;to M. le Curé, for example;
he is learned also&mdash;that he is."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[Pg 652]</a></span></p>

<p>"That would be insulting to M.
Perdreau."</p>

<p>"Not at all. Two such learned
men would soon understand each
other. After all, you know, you
must do as you think best. Good-morning!
Thank you for Jean-Louis;
send him to me quickly. I must hurry
off to my rascally wood-cutters in
the wood of Montreux."</p>

<p>And the game-keeper turned his
back without waiting for an answer,
puffing away at his pipe so tremendously
his cap was in a cloud of
smoke.</p>

<p>Ragaud continued to shell his peas,
but it was easy to see he felt rather
anxious. Nevertheless, when he had
ended his work, he re-entered the
house without showing any discomposure.</p>

<p>Jean-Louis left home that morning
to spend a fortnight with Michou,
depressed in spirits, but still hoping
the best. On passing through Val-Saint,
he stopped at M. le Curé's,
who confirmed all that Michou had
said about the Perdreaux. That
dear, good man was much distressed,
but could not think of any remedy for
the evil; but he promised Jeannet to
say Mass for the family, and highly
approved of his leaving Muiceron for
a time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Ragauds acted as
though they were bewitched. During
the first week after the departure
of Jeannet, his name was scarcely
mentioned, even by Pierrette.
They appeared to have lost all recollection
of the services the excellent-hearted
boy had rendered his adopted
parents. No one thought of him
or noticed him when he returned
sometimes late at night from his hard
day's work; and, had it not been
for the good Luguets, poor Jean-Louis
would have been as isolated in
the world as if he had been brought
up in a foundling asylum&mdash;his first
destination. But God did not abandon
him, and, although always very
sad, he did not lose courage. Every
evening, whether he returned or not
to Muiceron, he visited his friends,
and there, with Pierre and Solange, he
recovered his good-humor, or at least
maintained his gentleness and resignation.
His friendship for Solange
increased day by day. He suspected
nothing, nor she either; for although
very friendly and intimate,
they only felt toward each other like
brother and sister. However, all
was known in the village&mdash;better,
perhaps, than elsewhere&mdash;and the
gossips commenced to say that the
devout Solange jumped at marriage
as quickly as any other girl. Several
of the girls even commenced to tease
her about him; all of which she received
gently, and smiled without
being displeased, contenting herself
with the remark that, after all, she
might choose worse; and her work
was continued more faithfully than
ever.</p>

<p>One evening, when Pierre and his
parents remained rather late at the
fair at Andrieux, which is three good
leagues from Ordonniers, and which
is only reached by roads very difficult
to travel in the bad season,
Jeannet, as usual, went to the Luguets,
and was surprised to find Solange
all alone. She blushed slightly
when she saw him, not from embarrassment,
however, but only, I imagine,
because she remembered the reports
that were circulating in the village.
Jeannet took his usual seat,
which was always near hers. The
month of November was nearly
ended, and that morning Michou
had told Jean-Louis that Jeannette's
betrothal would take place a little
before Christmas, and the marriage
soon after. The poor fellow was
overwhelmed with sorrow; he poured
all his grief into Solange's ear, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[Pg 653]</a></span>
so great was his confidence in her
that he allowed himself to weep in
her presence.</p>

<p>"You have lost your courage and
become thoroughly hopeless," said
Solange gently. "I don't like that in
a man, still less in a Christian."</p>

<p>"How can I help it? Am I made
of stone?" replied Jeannet, his head
buried in his hands. "Alas! alas!
Solange, I believed your words. I
thought that God would have mercy
on us, and that this unfortunate marriage
would not take place."</p>

<p>"I don't see that it has yet," replied
Solange. "In the first place,
they only speak of signing the contract
a month from now, and up to
then the mill will turn more than
once; and, after all, does not God
know better than we what is good
for us, poor blind things that we
are?"</p>

<p>"That is true; but to see Jeannette
the wife of that man, without
faith or fear of God or law; to see
my old father and dear, good mother
reduced to want; to be obliged to
leave the country, and never see
Muiceron again! For think, Solange,
that Jeannette, when she signs
her marriage contract, will know that
I am not her brother! I will not
wait to be told that my place is outside
of the house. God knows I have
worked for my parents, and their
tenderness never humiliated me, but
to receive a benefit from Isidore&mdash;no,
never!" cried Jean-Louis, raising
his eyes that flashed with honest pride.</p>

<p>"You are right in that," said Solange
quietly; "but listen a
moment, ... and first sit down there," she
added, gently placing her hand on
his arm. "Come to your senses.
There, now, can you yet listen patiently
to me?"</p>

<p>"Go on," said Jean-Louis obediently;
"you need not talk long to
calm me."</p>

<p>"Well," resumed Solange, resting
her elbow on the table in such a
manner that her sweet face nearly
touched Jeannet's shoulder, "I will
repeat again that the story is not yet
ended; but as this good reason is
not weighty enough for your excited
brain, I beg you will tell me why
you think Jeannette will despise you
when she will learn that you are not
her brother."</p>

<p>"But how can you expect it to be
otherwise, my dear friend? Is it not
against me that I seem to be installed
in her house for life? that I
have had half the hearts of her parents?
Do you think that Isidore,
who detests me, will not tell a thousand
falsehoods to prejudice her
against me? Ah! Solange, I have
suffered terribly during the last
month; but to see Jeannette regard
me as an intruder; to have her crush
me with her scorn, and make me feel
that I am a foundling, picked up
from the gutter&mdash;it is beyond all human
strength, and the good God
will not compel me to endure such
agony. I will not expose myself to
such a trial."</p>

<p>"But what can you do? You
cannot get work in the country without
running the risk of meeting her
at every turn."</p>

<p>"I will manage it," said Jean-Louis.
"France is a kind mother,
Solange, and has never refused food
to one of her sons, even though he
had no name but the one given in
baptism. I know that my dear father
intended to procure a substitute
for me; but, in the present situation, I
can no longer accept a cent of Jeannette's
inheritance, which will one day
be Isidore's."</p>

<p>"Good," said Solange. "But wait
another moment. All this is still in the
future, since you can only be drawn
next year; so put that aside. I
will only say that you have spoken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[Pg 654]</a></span>
like a good-hearted fellow, for which
I don't compliment you, as I knew
you were that before. But, to return
to what we were speaking of, why do
you think you will be scorned by
Jeannette? Come, now, tell me all.
You love the little thing? and ...
more than a brother loves a sister?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Jeannet, hiding his
face, which he felt crimsoning, like a
young girl surprised, "you drag the
last secret from my heart. Yes, I
love her, I love her to madness, and
that adds to the bitterness of my despair.
May God pardon me! I have
already confessed it, but with my
great sorrow is mingled a wicked
sentiment. Solange! I am jealous;
I know it well. What can you expect?
I was so before I knew it,
and I cannot drive it from me. Did
I ever feel that she was not my sister?
No, not once until the day
that there was question of her marriage;
and yet," added he clasping
his hands, "God, who hears me,
knows that if she had chosen one
worthy of her, I would have had the
strength to conquer it for the sake
of her happiness. But so many misfortunes
have made me what I am,
and&mdash;what I only avow to you&mdash;incapable
of surmounting my jealousy
and dislike."</p>

<p>While he spoke thus, beautiful
Solange smiled, not like a scornful
woman, who has no pity for feelings
to which she is insensible, but like a
mother who is sure of consoling her
sick child. Her clear, tranquil eyes
rested upon Jean-Louis, who gradually
raised his, that he might look at
her in his turn; for everything about
this girl of twenty years was so gentle
and calm, and at the same time
so good, one always expected to receive
consolation from her.</p>

<p>"You wish to scold me?" said
Jean-Louis. "If so, do it without
fear, if you think I am in fault."</p>

<p>"Not at all," she replied; "there
is nothing wrong in what you have
confided to me, Jeannet. I pity you
with my whole heart, only I scarcely
understand you."</p>

<p>"Why so, Solange? You are,
however, very kind, and certainly have
a heart."</p>

<p>"I hope so," said she; "but when a
creature is loved so dearly, she should
be esteemed in every respect."</p>

<p>"Don't I esteem Jeannette? O
Solange! why do you say that?"</p>

<p>"But I only repeat what you first
said, my child," she replied in her
maternal tone, which was very sweet
in that young mouth. "You think
her capable of despising you, and
imagine that she will disdain you
when she learns the misfortune of
your birth; therefore, you do not
esteem her, and so, I repeat, I can't
understand such great affection."</p>

<p>"You can reason very coolly
about it," said Jeannet; "but if your
soul were troubled like mine, you
would not see so clearly to the bottom
of things."</p>

<p>"It is precisely because you are so
troubled that the good God permits
this conversation to-night," she replied.
"Let me tell you now why I
still hope. Jeannette at this moment
sins by the head, but her heart is untouched;
and here is the proof: the
secret you so dread her knowing she
has known as well as either of us
for more than three months. Have
you seen any change in her manner?"</p>

<p>"Oh! is it possible?" cried Jeannet.
"And who told her?"</p>

<p>"I myself," answered Solange.
"She had heard at the château some
words dropped by Dame Berthe,
which excited her curiosity. After
her sickness, when I went to stay
with her, she one day asked an explanation
of her doubts; and as I
feared, if she questioned others, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[Pg 655]</a></span>
would not be properly answered, I
told her all."</p>

<p>"You did right; and what was her
reply?"</p>

<p>"She threw herself in my arms,
and thanked me," said Solange. "For
more than an hour she spoke of her
great affection for you, which time
had augmented instead of diminishing.
She wept for your misfortune,
and thanked God that her parents
had acted so well, as by that act
they had given her a brother; and
never did I see her so gentle, tender,
and kind. She made me promise I
would never tell you that she knew
your secret; but the poor child did
not then foresee the necessity that
compels me to speak to-night on account
of your wicked thoughts."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear Jeannette!" said
Jean-Louis, with tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I have heard lately," continued
Solange, "that she came near sending
off Isidore, because he presumed,
thinking she knew nothing, to make
some allusion to the subject. She
declared that she considered you
her brother, and those who wished
to be friends of hers must think the
same."</p>

<p>"Say no more," said Jeannet.
"I will love her more than ever."</p>

<p>"No," replied she, "it is useless.
Only don't despair. Take courage,
for there is always hope when the
heart is good; and the moment this
poor child, who is now acting without
reflection, will know she should
despise Isidore, she will dismiss him
and drive him away as she would a
dangerous animal."</p>

<p>"But will she ever know it?" said
Jean-Louis.</p>

<p>"Hope in God," replied the pious
girl. "Has he ever yet abandoned
you?"</p>

<p>"Beg him to make me as confident
as you," said he, looking at her with
admiration. "What good you do
me! How can I repay you, Solange,
for such kind words?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said she seriously&mdash;"perhaps,
one day, I may ask you to
do me a great service."</p>

<p>"Really! Let me know it now.
I will be so happy to serve you."</p>

<p>"Yes? Well, then, I will," replied
Solange, after a moment's hesitation.
"You have laid bare your
heart to me; I will return your confidence.
Jean-Louis, I also have a
secret love in my soul, and I will
die if I do not obtain what I desire."</p>

<p>"You!" said Jeannet, astonished;
"you, dear Solange! I always
thought you so quiet and so happy
in your life."</p>

<p>"It is true," said she, sighing. "I
look so, because I cannot let people
see what they could not understand.
But with you, Jean-Louis, it is different;
I can tell you everything."</p>

<p>"I hope, at least," said Jeannet,
smiling, "that he whom you love is
worthy of your esteem."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes," she replied, crossing
her arms on her breast, while her
pale, beautiful face crimsoned with
fervor&mdash;"oh! yes, for he whom I love
is the Lord our God. I wish to be
a Sister of Charity, Jeannet, and until
then there will be no happiness
on earth for me."</p>

<p>Jean-Louis for a moment was
dumb with surprise at this avowal;
then he knelt before her, and kissed
her hands.</p>

<p>"I might have suspected it," said
he, much moved; "you were not
made to live the ordinary life of the
world. God bless you, dear Solange,
and may his holy angels accompany
you! But what can I do to aid you
in your holy wishes?"</p>

<p>"Much," she replied; "you can
inform my parents, and afterwards
console them; reason with Pierre,
who will be half crazy when he hears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[Pg 656]</a></span>
of my departure; and perhaps you
can even accompany me to Paris,
for I am afraid to go alone. I have
never been away from home, and I
would not dare venture on that long
journey."</p>

<p>"But, dear Solange, you will need
a great deal of money for that."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said she, laughing, "do
you think me a child? For two years
I have deprived myself of everything,
and I have more than enough.
See," she added, opening a little box,
which she kept hidden under a plaster
statue of the Blessed Virgin, which
stood near her bed. "Count!"</p>

<p>"Three hundred francs!" said
Jeannet, after having counted; "and
ten, and twenty, and thirty more&mdash;three
hundred and sixty, besides the
change. There are nearly four hundred
francs."</p>

<p>"There will be when I am paid
for what I am now embroidering,"
said she. "Is that enough?"</p>

<p>"Ten times too much," replied
Jeannet. "Poor dear Solange! what
happiness to think that I shall see
you until the last moment!"</p>

<p>"And afterwards again," said she
gaily; "the white cornets are made
to go over the world. We will meet
again, don't fear!"</p>

<p>It is truly said that example is
better than precept. Jean-Louis became
a man again before that beautiful
and pious girl, so brave and so
good. His heart was comforted, his
soul strengthened. He would have
blushed now to weep about his sorrows,
when Solange was about to
sacrifice her whole life to the sorrows
of others. She commenced to play
her part of Sister of Charity with him,
and God doubtless already blessed
her; for never did balm poured into
a wound produce a more instant
effect.</p>

<p>They finished their little arrangements
just as the Luguets returned
home. Pierre was rather gay, as he
could not go to the fair without
drinking with his friends; and when a
man's ordinary drink is water colored
with the skins of grapes, half a pint
is enough to make him feel jolly.</p>

<p>Therefore, when he found Solange
and Jeannet in conversation, looking
rather more serious than usual, he
commenced to look very wise, whistled,
winking from one to the other,
to let them know he understood what
was going on. Jean-Louis was seated
near the fire, and pondered over
the mutual confidences made that
evening. He paid little attention to
Pierre's manœuvres; but Solange saw
them, and, while laying the cloth for
supper, begged her brother to explain,
in good French what was on his
mind.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, my pretty one!" said
he, trying to put his arm around
her waist, something which she did
not permit even in him; "we know
something about you."</p>

<p>"Nothing very bad," she replied,
laughing; "here I am before you in
flesh and blood, and you see I am
not at all sick."</p>

<p>"Don't be so sly," he answered;
"this is not the time. We returned
from the fair with lots of acquaintances,
and every one told us you were
going to be married, and that your
bans would be published next Sunday."</p>

<p>"It is rather too soon," said Solange
quietly; "the consent of the parents
will be needed, and I don't know
yet whether it will be given. And
to whom shall I be married? Those
people who are so well informed
should have told you that."</p>

<p>Thereupon Pierre, without answering,
struck Jean-Louis on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Look up, sleepy-head!" cried he
in his ear. "Can you tell me who is
going to marry my sister Solange?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[Pg 657]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who? What?" answered Jeannet,
like one coming out of a dream.
"What are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"I say that you and Solange can
keep a secret famously," said he,
rather spitefully. "It is well to keep
it secret, when you are only thinking
of marriage, and I don't object to
your first arranging it between yourselves;
but now that everybody
knows it except us, it is rather provoking
for the family."</p>

<p>"You are crazy," said Jean-Louis.</p>

<p>"A big baby, at least," said Solange,
shrugging her shoulders.</p>

<p>"All very well," said Pierre; "we
know what we know. We say nothing
further. When you choose to
speak of your affairs, well, we will be
ready to listen to you."</p>

<p>Jeannet was about to reply, but
Luguet and his wife, who all this while
had been in the barn, giving a look
at the cattle, to see that all was safe
for the night, re-entered the room,
and Solange motioned to Jean-Louis
not to continue such a useless conversation
before her parents.</p>

<p>But whether Pierre was more obstinate
than usual that night on account
of the wine in his head, or
whether his great friendship for Jeannet
inflamed his desire for the alliance,
certain it is he would not give
up his belief in the approaching marriage,
and continued throughout supper
to make jokes and clack his
wooden shoes underneath the table;
in fact, he acted like a boy who is
sure of his facts and loves to torment
people. Jean-Louis several times
was on the point of telling him to be
quiet, but Solange, with her gentle
smiles, always prevented him.</p>

<p>You can well perceive this confirmed
Pierre in his belief that they understood
each other, as honest lovers
have the right to do; so that, if he
was a little doubtful on his return
from the fair, he was no longer so at
the end of the supper, and went to
bed so firmly persuaded that he
would soon have Jeannet for brother-in-law,
they could easier have cut off
his right hand than make him believe
to the contrary.</p>

<h3>NANO NAGLE:<br />

FOUNDRESS OF THE PRESENTATION ORDER.</h3>


<p>There is no fact more apparent or
more full of significance in the history
of the church than the constant
acting and reacting upon each other
of races and nations in the perpetual
struggle between civilization and religion
with barbarism and infidelity,
light with darkness. While the faith
seems dimmed and its professors the
victims of persecution in one land, in
another the torch of learning and
piety is slowly but surely kindling
into brilliancy, and the ardor of
apostolic zeal is being awakened,
even by the supineness and apostasy
of its neighbors. That this should
be permitted or ordained by divine
Providence is a mystery to all, but its
effects can easily be perceived by
any ordinary student of history.</p>

<p>For proof of this mutation and
transition we need not go beyond
our own day and generation. Europe
of the XIXth century presents
a spectacle, if not alarming, at least
discouraging to many who have the
cause of Christianity sincerely at
heart. In one country we perceive
a direct attack on the Sovereign
Pontiff, wholesale spoliation of his
temporal possessions, restriction of
his personal liberty, and a general
onslaught on the religious orders&mdash;those
most efficient agents for the
propagation of morality, charity, and
intelligence&mdash;which surround him&mdash;and
that, too, by a prince of Catholic
origin and education, who claims the
right to govern twenty millions of
subjects. In another we have a stolid,
sordid <em>imperator</em>, instigated by a
more intellectual but not less arbitrary
minister, not only claiming
complete dominion over the lives
and property of twice that number,
but assuming also the right to dictate
the terms upon which they shall worship
their Maker, what shall be their
faith, and who may be their teachers
and guides in the way of salvation.</p>

<p>Again, in such countries as Austria,
France, Spain, and Belgium,
until very recently considered the
bulwarks of Catholicity on the Continent,
indifferentism, communism,
and open infidelity, if not yet triumphant,
have certainly of late made
rapid strides towards power and authority,
and to the human eye seriously
threaten the very existence of
society, of all order and all law, human
and divine, in those distracted
nations. And still, a prospect such
as Europe now presents, though
seemingly gloomy, is actually full of
hope and promise. While the hitherto
supine Catholics of the Italian
peninsula are being aroused into
earnestness by the outrages daily
perpetrated on the Holy Father and
the religious orders, and their co-religionists
of Germany are forming
themselves into a solid, compact, and
energetic array in defence of their
rights, elsewhere the cause of the
church is progressing with a rapidity
and uniformity that equally astonishes
and alarms her enemies.</p>

<p>Take our own republic, for example,
with its seven archbishops, its
forty-nine bishops, thousands of
priests, and millions of earnest and
obedient spiritual children, where a
century ago a priest was an object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[Pg 659]</a></span>
of curiosity to most of the people,
and a Catholic was generally regarded
with less favor than is now
shown the Chinese idolaters. Now,
what has wrought this change; what
has scattered broadcast over this
vast continent, and engrafted in the
heart of our vigorous young republic
the doctrines of the church, but
the persecutions which our co-religionists
have endured and are still enduring,
in the Old World? To the irreligious
maniacs of the French Revolution,
to the penal code of Great
Britain, and now to the mendacity of
Victor Emanuel and the truculent
tyranny of Bismarck, are we mainly
indebted, under Providence, for the
origin, growth, and increase of Catholicity
among us. Like a subterranean
fire, the spirit of the church
can never be repressed. Subdued in
one place, it will burst forth in another
with redoubled force, intensified
by the very attempts made to
confine it.</p>

<p>Then let us look at England&mdash;England
which among the nations
was the land of the Reformation;
who not only stoned the prophets,
but whose annals for nearly three
centuries are the most anti-Catholic
and intolerant to be found in the
records of modern history. She, also,
as in the early ages of her conversion,
felt the effect of continental barbarism
and persecution. At the very
time when the faith seemed to have
been utterly extirpated within her
boundaries, the French Revolution
drove to her shores many Catholics,
lay and clerical, of gentle birth, cultivated
manners, and varied accomplishments,
and to those exiles does
she owe primarily the revival in her
bosom of the religion planted by S.
Augustine. She has now sixteen
archbishops and bishops, sixteen hundred
priests, over one thousand places
of worship, where assemble large
congregations, including many of the
most eminent and distinguished of
her sons.</p>

<p>The Catholics of Ireland, always
true to the faith and loyal to the
head of the church, were common
sufferers with their co-religionists
across the Channel, and, though in a
different manner and at an earlier
period, they were equally the gainers
with those of England, and from
causes almost similar. The property
of that cruelly tried people was not
only confiscated by the penal laws,
their clergy outlawed, and their persons
subjected to all sorts of pains
and penalties, but they were denied
the poor privilege of acquiring the
principles of the commonest education.
The consequences of such
persecution, continued generation
after generation, were what might
have been, and no doubt was, expected
to be&mdash;that the people, persistently
refusing to yield to cajolery or threats
in matters of conscience, within two
centuries after the "Reformation"
had almost universally sunk into abject
poverty and secular ignorance.
In fact, had it not been for their traditional
knowledge of the great truths
of religion, and the instruction sometimes
stealthily given them by some
fugitive priest in remote mountains
and the fastnesses of the bogs, they
must inevitably have degenerated
into something like primitive barbarism.</p>

<p>However, such an anomalous state
as this could not last for ever. All
Christendom was about to cry out
against it, and an incident occurred
in 1745, under the administration
of the celebrated Lord Chesterfield,
which awakened at home general attention
to the wretched manner in
which four-fifths of the inhabitants of
the country were obliged to worship
their Creator. It happened that in
that year a small congregation was as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[Pg 660]</a></span>sembled
secretly in an old store, in an
obscure part of Dublin, to hear Mass,
when the floor gave way, and the entire
body was precipitated to the
ground below. F. Fitzgerald, the
celebrant, and nine of his parishioners,
were killed, and several others
severely injured. The viceroy, who,
whatever may have been his other
faults, was certainly less bigoted
than his predecessors, thereupon
took the responsibility of allowing
the Catholics, under certain restrictions,
to open their chapels, and worship
in public. This limited concession
was the commencement of a new
era in the affairs of the Irish Catholics.
The number of priests began
to increase; churches, rude and
small of necessity, sprang up here
and there, generally in secluded localities,
as if afraid to show themselves;
and incipient efforts for the
education of the masses of both sexes
were soon noticed.</p>

<p>In this latter great work of benevolence
the most zealous and efficient
was the lady whose name heads this
article. She seems to have been endowed
by Providence with all the
gifts, mental and moral, necessary to
constitute her the pioneer of that
host of noble women who, since her
time to the present, have devoted
themselves to the education and
training of the females of Ireland.
Born of an ancient and thoroughly
Catholic family of considerable
wealth and wide popular influence,
she grew up amid home scenes of
comfort, peace, and charity, a devout
believer in the sanctity of religion, and
in perfect accord with the instructions
of indulgent but watchful parents.
The position her father held among
his poorer and less fortunate neighbors,
his charity to the needy, and
his protection to the helpless, afforded
her, even in her extreme youth,
many opportunities of studying the
wants of the distressed, and of sympathizing
with their afflictions: principles
which, then perhaps nourished
in her heart unconsciously, were in
after-years destined to grow and fructify
into those nobler deeds of charity
that have made her memory so cherished
and revered.</p>

<p>Honora, or, as her friends and
beneficiaries loved to call her, Nano
Nagle, was the daughter of a gentleman
named Garret Nagle, of Ballygriffin,
near Mallow, in the county of
Cork, where she was born <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1728.
Through both parents she was related,
not only to many of the old
Catholic houses, but to several of the
most influential Protestant families
in the South; which is only worthy
of remark as furnishing a clew to the
fact of her parents' wealth and social
standing in times when those of the
proscribed religion were not only
disqualified from accumulating or
holding property in their own right,
but were personally objects of contempt
and contumely to the dominant
class. It may also, perhaps, account
for the impunity with which
Mr. Nagle, despite the numerous
statutory enactments, was enabled to
send his favorite child to the Continent
to complete an education the
rudiments only of which could be obtained
in the privacy of her family.</p>

<p>Accordingly, at an early age, Nano
quitted her pleasant and cheerful
home by the Blackwater for the retirement
and austerity of a convent
on the banks of the Seine, in which
institution she acquired all the accomplishments
and graces then considered
befitting a young lady of
position.</p>

<p>Having entered school a mere
girl from a remote part of a semi-civilized
country, untutored, undeveloped,
and, it is even said, a little
petulant and self-willed, she now, at
her twenty-first year, emerged from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[Pg 661]</a></span>
the shadow of the convent walls into
the sunshine of Parisian life, an educated,
beautiful, and self-sustained woman.
Her family had many friends
in the French capital, particularly in
the households of the Irish Brigade
officers and other Catholic exiles,
and her entrance into the best society
was unimpeded, and was even
signalized by rare scenes of festivity
and mutual gratification. Her native
<i lang="fr">naïveté</i> and buoyancy of spirits,
tempered with all the well-bred
courtesy and dignity of a French
education under the old <i lang="fr">régime</i>,
made her a general favorite; and
though it does not appear that she
was in the least spoiled by the admiration
and adulation that everywhere
awaited her, there is little
doubt that she participated in the
fashionable dissipations of the gay
capital with all the ardor and impetuosity
latent in her disposition. Admitted
to such scenes, it is little wonder
that for a time she forgot the
land of her birth, its persecutions
and tribulations, its degraded peasantry
and timid and degenerate aristocracy.
One so young and so capable
of appreciating the refinements
and elegancies of the most cultured
city in Europe, might well have been
excused if she found it difficult to
exchange them for the obscurity and
monotony of a remote provincial
town.</p>

<p>But the spell which at this time
bound her was soon to be broken.
The still, small voice of duty and
conscience was soon to find a tongue
and speak to her soul with the force
almost of inspiration. The circumstances
of this radical change in her
life are thus graphically described in
a very valuable book recently published:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In the small, early hours of a spring
morning of the year 1750, a heavy, lumbering
carriage rolled over the uneven
pavement of the quartier Saint Germain
of the French capital, awakening the
echoes of the still sleeping city. The
beams of the rising sun had not yet
struggled over the horizon to light up the
spires and towers and lofty housetops,
but the cold, gray dawn was far advanced.
The occupants of the carriage were an
Irish young lady of two-and twenty, and
her chaperon, a French lady, both fatigued
and listlessly reclining in their
respective corners. They had lately
formed part of a gay and glittering crowd
in one of the most fashionable Parisian
<i lang="fr">salons</i>. As they moved onward, each
communing with her own thoughts, in
all probability reverting to the brilliant
scene they had just left, and anticipating
the recurrence of many more such, the
young lady's attention was suddenly attracted
by a crowd of poor people standing
at the yet unopened door of a parish
church. They were work-people, waiting
for admission by the porter, in order
to hear Mass before they entered on their
day's work.</p>

<p>"The young lady was forcibly struck.
She reflected on the hard lot of those
children of toil, their meagre fare, their
wretched dwellings, their scanty clothing,
their constant struggle to preserve themselves
and their families even in this
humble position&mdash;a struggle in many
a case unavailing; for sickness, or interruption
of employment, or one of the
many other casualties incidental to their
state, might any day sink them still
deeper in penury. She reflected seriously
on all this; and then she dwelt on their
simple faith, their humble piety, their
thus 'preventing the day to worship
God.' She contrasted their lives with
those of the gay votaries of fashion and
pleasure, of whom she was one. She
felt dissatisfied with herself, and asked
her own heart, Might she not be more
profitably employed? Her thoughts next
naturally reverted to her native land,
then groaning under the weight of persecution
for conscience' sake&mdash;its religion
proscribed, its altars overturned, its sanctuaries
desolate, its children denied,
under grievous penalties, the blessings
of free education.</p>

<p>"She felt at once that there was a great
mission to be fulfilled, and that, with
God's blessing, she might do something
towards its fulfilment. For a long time
she dwelt earnestly on what we may now
regard as an inspiration from heaven.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[Pg 662]</a></span>
She frequently commended the matter to
God, and took the advice of pious and
learned ecclesiastics; and the result was
that great work which has ever been since,
and is in our day, a source of benediction
and happiness to countless thousands
of poor families in her native land,
and has made the name of Nano Nagle
worthy of a high place on the roll of the
heroines of charity."<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p></div>

<p>Miss Nagle then set out for Ireland,
firmly determined to commence the
noble work so suddenly contemplated
and so maturely considered; but on
her arrival in Cork, she found her
friends exceedingly lukewarm, and the
amount of ignorance and destitution in
that city so appalling that she shrank
from the very magnitude of the difficulties
to be overcome, and began to
fear that she had, in a moment of enthusiasm,
overrated her ability and
mistaken her vocation. This was natural.
What could a young lady,
scarcely entered on womanhood, delicately
nurtured, and hitherto accustomed
only to the society of the
most fastidious&mdash;what could such a
frail scion of aristocracy do to remove
even an infinitesimal part of the incubus
of poverty, ignorance, and
crime, the result of centuries of misgovernment,
which then weighed so
heavily on the people?</p>

<p>She therefore resolved to visit the
French capital again to consult eminent
clerical friends, and to lay before
them all her doubts and difficulties.
They heard her explanations
and arguments with attention,
weighed her objections with proper
gravity, and finally, having dispelled
her doubts and strengthened her
self-confidence, assured her that in
their opinion&mdash;and it was a unanimous
one&mdash;God had evidently called
her to be the succor and comfort of
her afflicted countrywomen&mdash;a decision
which subsequent events proved
to have been little short of prophetic.
Thus reassured, and casting aside
once for all the allurements of life,
the rational pleasures which youth,
beauty, and wealth might reasonably
command, Miss Nagle resolved to
eschew the things of the world for
ever, and devote herself heart and
soul to the self-imposed duties from
the performance of which she had
lately shrunk, more from a consciousness
of the weakness of her position
than from any lack of intention to
perform them faithfully. The resolve
she so solemnly made then she
kept till the day of her death, thirty
years afterwards, with unflinching
fortitude and fidelity.</p>

<p>In 1754 we find her back in Cork,
steadily but quietly, almost secretly,
as the spirit of the times demanded,
initiating her crusade against squalor
and ignorance. With what precocious
circumspection she commenced
her labors is best shown in a letter to
a friend, Miss Fitzsimmons, then in
the Ursuline Convent at Paris. The
extract is long, but it will repay
perusal, as it may be considered an
exact reflex of the working of her
strong, simple, but thoroughly earnest
mind. She writes under date
July 17, 1769:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"When I arrived, I kept my design a
profound secret, as I knew, if it were
spoken of, I should meet with opposition
on every side, particularly from my own
immediate family; as, to all appearances,
they would suffer from it. My confessor
was the only person I told of it; and as
I could not appear in the affair, I sent my
maid to get a good mistress, and to take
in thirty poor girls. When the little
school was settled, I used to steal there
in the morning. My brother thought I
was in the chapel. This passed on very
well until, one day, a poor man came to
him, to speak to me to take his child into
my school; on which he came in to his
wife and me, laughing at the conceit of a
man who was mad and thought I was in
the situation of a schoolmistress. Then
I owned that I had set up a school; on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[Pg 663]</a></span>
which he fell into a violent passion, and
said a vast deal on the bad consequences
that may follow. His wife is very zealous,
and so is he; but worldly interests
blinded him at first. He was soon reconciled
to it. He was not the person I
most dreaded would be brought into
trouble about it; it was my uncle Nagle,
who is, I think, the most disliked by the
Protestants of any Catholic in the kingdom.
I expected a great deal from him.
The best part of my fortune I have received
from him. When he heard it, he
was not at all angry at it; and in a little
time they were so good as to contribute
largely to support it. And I took in children
by degrees, not to make any noise
about it in the beginning. In about nine
months I had about two hundred children.
When the Catholics saw what service it
did, they begged that, for the convenience
of the children, I would set up schools
for children at the other end of the town
from where I was, to be under my care
and direction; and they promised to contribute
to the support of them. With this
request I readily complied, and the same
number of children that I had were taken
in; and at the death of my uncle, I supported
them all at my own expense. I did
not intend to take boys, but my sister-in-law
made it a point, and said she would
not allow any of my family to contribute
to them unless I did so; on which I got
a master, and took in only forty boys.
They are in a house by themselves, and
have no communication with the others."</p></div>

<p>This letter, it will be observed, was
written fifteen years after the first
school was founded, and already there
were in active operation, in various
parts of the city, two schools for boys
and five for girls, all under the supervision
of Miss Nagle, and supported
from her private purse, or by a contribution
of one shilling per month,
which she was in the habit of collecting
from a few of the more wealthy
of the citizens. In these nurseries
of intelligence and morality&mdash;model
schools, in fact&mdash;the children of both
sexes were taught to read and write,
to say their daily prayers, learn the
catechism, and, in the case of the
older girls, to acquire a familiarity
with such useful work as befitted
their condition. Those who were of
sufficient age heard Mass every morning,
went to confession monthly, and
to communion as frequently as their
confessor considered advisable.</p>

<p>In supervising so many schools,
and constantly instructing hundreds
of pupils, whose moral as well as
mental culture had been neglected
hitherto most wofully, this heroic
woman's self-imposed labors, it may
well be imagined, were of the most
arduous description, and we are not
surprised to find that her health began
to show signs of giving way.
"In the beginning," she says, "being
obliged to speak for upwards of four
hours, and my chest not being so
strong as it had been, I spat blood,
which I took care to conceal, for
fear of being prevented from instructing
the poor. It has not the least bad
effect now. When I have done preparing
them at each end of the town, I
feel like an idler that has nothing to
do, though I speak almost as much
as when I prepare them for their first
communion. I find not the least difficulty
in it. I explain the catechism
as well as I can in one school or
other every day; and if every one
thought as little of labor as I do,
they would have little merit. I often
think that my schools will never bring
me to heaven, as I only take delight
and pleasure in them. You see it
has pleased the Almighty to make
me succeed when I had everything,
I may say, to fight against. I assure
you I did not expect a farthing from
any mortal towards the support of
my schools; and I thought I should
not have more than fifty or sixty
girls until I got a fortune; nor did I
think I should in Cork. I began in
a poor, humble manner; and though
it has pleased the divine will to give
me severe trials in this foundation,
yet it is to show that it is his work,
and has not been effected by human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[Pg 664]</a></span>
means. I can assure you that my
schools are beginning to be of
service to a great many parts of the
world. This is a place of great trade.
They are heard of; and my views
are not for one object alone." The
fortune here so delicately alluded to
was left her by her uncle Nagle, who,
profoundly penetrated with a sense
of her discretion and of her devotion
to the friendless, bequeathed her the
bulk of his property. It was a very
considerable sum, and was unstintingly
devoted by her to further the great
objects she had ever in view.</p>

<p>As her schools multiplied, and the
attendance on each increased, with
a rapidity that astonished every one,
Miss Nagle saw the absolute necessity
of calling in other and, if possible,
organized assistance, that thus, by
making her system more perfect, she
might perpetuate the good work already
so auspiciously begun. She
therefore resolved on a bold measure&mdash;one
that could have entered only
the mind of a dauntless spirit, fortified
by implicit faith in the protection of
Providence. She determined, in fact,
despite the many inhuman and ingenious
penal statutes against monastic
institutions, to establish a convent
in Cork.</p>

<p>For this purpose, some time previous
to the date of the above letter,
four young ladies, representing some
of the best families in the neighborhood,
were sent to the Ursuline Convent
of S. Jacques, in Paris, to enter
their novitiate, while Miss Nagle,
with her usual generosity and prudence,
set silently to work to build a
suitable house for their reception on
their return. That event took place
in 1771, and marks a new era in the
history of the church in Ireland and
England. The young novices who
thus not only abandoned the allurements
of the world, home, friends,
and future, to serve God, but braved
the terrors of the penal laws and the
sneers of the anti-Catholic rabble,
deserve to have their names handed
down for the admiration and homage
of their sex in every age and clime.
They were "Miss Fitzsimmons, the
special friend and correspondent of
the foundress; Miss Nagle, her relative;
Miss Coppinger, of the Barryscourt
family, and cousin of Marian,
Duchess of Norfolk; and Miss Kavanagh,
related to the noble house
of Ormonde." They were accompanied
by Mrs. Margaret Kelly, a professed
sister of the Ursuline Convent
of Dieppe, none of the sisters of S.
Jacques being willing to undertake
so hazardous an enterprise.</p>

<p>They arrived in May, and on the
18th of September following took formal
possession of their convent, and
from that day may be dated the reintroduction
of the conventual order into
the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>Thus in the wise designs of God,
while the Encyclopedists and the
secret societies of the Continent were
maturing their plans of attack on the
church and her institutions, when
monasteries, convents, colleges, and
hospitals from one end of Europe to
the other, already feeling the premonitory
symptoms of that monstrous
earthquake of immorality and infidelity
which was soon to be felt
throughout Christendom, were shaking
to their very foundations, in an
obscure little city in the South of
Ireland were planted the seeds of religion
and Christian instruction which
have since grown up and produced
such marvellous fruits. The incident
becomes even more interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[Pg 665]</a></span>
when we consider that the five ladies
who commenced this beneficent work
were all educated in that country
and city, which ere long were to furnish
the deadliest enemies of Catholicity.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that so
daring an act as that of the intrepid
Nano could pass unnoticed. Though
the sisters studied the greatest seclusion,
it was at one time proposed by
the local authorities to enforce the
laws against them; but better counsels
prevailed, and the humble community
grew rapidly in popularity
and usefulness. A few months after
its establishment, a select school,
with twelve young ladies as pupils,
was founded, and this number was
quickly augmented by children from
the more wealthy Catholic families
of the adjoining counties. There
are now five houses of this order in
Ireland.</p>

<p>At first Miss Nagle lived in the
convent; but her impatient soul, her
burning love for the children of the
lowly, was not yet satisfied; for though
the good Ursulines devoted all their
available time to the instruction of
the poor, while perfecting in the
higher branches of education those
destined in turn to become teachers,
she felt that another and a more
comprehensive organization was necessary
to combat so vast an array
of popular error, ignorance, and destitution.
A society that would devote
itself, as she had so long done,
individually, exclusively, and gratuitously
to the service of the impoverished
and untrained masses was
what she desired, and what she felt
called upon to form and direct.
With that indomitable energy which
I ever characterized her, though enfeebled
in health, reduced in fortune,
and prematurely old from incessant
labor, at the age of forty-four she retired
from the companionship of her
friends and <em>protégés</em>, the Ursulines, to
a house adjacent to the convent, purchased
by herself, and, gathering
around her some pious women, formed
a society that was to be known
as "Of the Presentation of Our Blessed
Lady in the Temple." The objects
of this association were: "Going
through the city, looking after
poor girls; inducing them to attend
school, and instructing them in their
religion; and, further, visiting, relieving,
and consoling the sick poor in
their own homes and in the public
hospitals&mdash;duties analogous to those
now discharged by the Sisters of
Charity and Sisters of Mercy."<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
Being approved by the bishop of the
diocese, the Rt. Rev. Dr. Moylan,
it began its pious labors on Christmas
day, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1777, by entertaining at
dinner fifty poor persons, the foundress
being the presiding genius, or rather
angel, of the entertainment. She
also established, in connection with
the home, an asylum for aged females.</p>

<p>This was the origin of what is now
known as the <em>Presentation Order</em>, and
was the last and crowning glory of
Nano Nagle's remarkable career.
Though of exclusively Irish origin,
and notwithstanding that the original
design of its foundress has been somewhat
changed, and its field of labor
circumscribed and partly occupied by
other orders or congregations, the
institution founded by her with such
limited means and materials has, with
God's blessing, flourished with amazing
rapidity, and has spread its influence,
not only over the native land
of the foundress, but to Great Britain,
the lower provinces of North
America, and even to India and
Australia. In Ireland alone there
are at least fifty convents of the
order, with poor schools, industrial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[Pg 666]</a></span>
schools, and asylums for the aged
attached.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>In 1791 the society was reorganized
and founded into a congregation
at the request of the Bishop of Cork.
The brief of Pope Pius VI. granting
the prayer, directed that the members
should observe as near as possible
the rules governing the Ursulines,
taking, after proper novitiate, simple
vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience.
Sixteen years later the congregation
was changed into an order
by brief of Pius VII., under the title
and invocation of the "Presentation
of the Blessed Virgin Mary." The
rules and constitutions governing
the congregation and order were, at
the request of His Holiness, drawn up
by Dr. Moylan, approved by the
archbishops and bishops of Ireland,
and upon being forwarded to Rome,
and upon proper examination, received
the Papal sanction.</p>

<p>The six or seven years spent by
Miss Nagle as head of the Society
of the Presentation were perhaps the
most useful of her life; for not only
did she create and perfect a plan of
practical instruction and discriminating
charity which has since been of
infinite benefit in promoting the
cause of religion and industry in other
parts of Ireland; not only did she
inculcate in others who were to survive
her, principles of order, charity,
and self-denial, but she organized a
system of relief and a scheme of instruction
which were of infinite benefit
to the deserving poor of Cork, and
which were afterwards applied with
equal advantage by other religious
bodies in other cities and towns.
None knew so well as she did to
whom to give and whom to refuse,
though it may be well imagined that
her gentle heart, when it erred, leaned
in favor of the latter.</p>

<p>Nor must we suppose that the
early years of what might be called
her missionary labors were devoted
exclusively to the instruction of her
little waifs. On the contrary, much
of her time&mdash;all, in fact, that could be
spared from her private devotions
and her beloved schools&mdash;was devoted
to the visitation of the sick and
the relief of the starving; for starvation,
be it remembered, was even
then chronic in the South of Ireland.
On her return from France, she at
first mingled occasionally in society,
as much to conceal, perhaps, her immature
plans as in deference to the
wishes of her friends; but gradually
she withdrew from all association
with those of her own station, and
devoted her entire time to acts of
practical charity. Even the most
inclement winter weather could not
deter her from her duty; and it
is said that before daylight she
might be noticed wending her way
to the little North Cork chapel, to
hear Mass as the commencement of
a long day's labor, and that far into
the night, in the unlighted streets of
Cork, a female figure, closely enwrapped
in a cloak and bearing a lantern,
could be seen hurrying to the death-bed
of some poor sufferer, regardless
of rain or snow or the cutting night-blast.
So familiar had this apparition
become to the citizens, and so
well her errands of mercy were
known, that the vilest of both sexes
passed her with respect, and she
trod the lanes and alleys of the worst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">[Pg 667]</a></span>
parts of the city with perfect safety.
At the sight of that little lantern in
the distance, the drunken brawler, as
he reeled home, ceased his ribald
song or stayed the half-uttered oath;
and the ill-starred wanderer, the pariah
of her sex, fled to some hiding-place,
or came forth for a few words
of gentle admonition, which fell like
healing balm on her wounded, sinful
soul; for Nano Nagle, in humble
imitation of her Redeemer, had
charity for all, even for the most degraded
of mankind.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to say that, in all
her toils and struggles, Miss Nagle
enjoyed the respect and esteem, and,
when required, the assistance, of all
the more wealthy and respectable of
the citizens of Cork, Protestant as
well as Catholic; but it was amid
her children and in the hovels of the
poor that she was best beloved, because
best known. Where famine
hollowed the cheek and glazed the
eye, she was to be found, with her
brave words of comfort and hope,
and, better still, with her well-filled
basket and open purse; where sickness
and disease lurked, and the atmosphere
of the miserable dwellings
of the fever-stricken was laden with
almost certain death, her place was
at the bedside of the dying, consoling
and solacing; now administering
the cooling draught to the poor
patient's burning lips; now, by prayer
and spiritual instruction, endeavoring
to smooth the path to a better world
of the soul that was struggling to be
free. No danger daunted her, no
sight, however repulsive, stayed her
persistent charity; and it is even said
that the once brilliant and accomplished
favorite of the Rue St. Germain
did not hesitate, when she considered
herself called upon to do so,
to perform the most menial of domestic
offices for her sick or aged
pensioners.</p>

<p>Thirty years of such unremitting
labor was more than a constitution
of ordinary strength could well bear;
and even Miss Nagle, buoyed up
as she was by intense devotion to
the poor, felt that the hand of death
was upon her, and that she was
about to receive the eternal reward
of her virtues, her charity, and her
zeal in the service of God. Early in
1784 her health completely broke
down, and, thus timely warned, she
prepared, with Christian sincerity and
humility, to leave the scenes of her
earthly labors, and pass through those
portals which, for the just, open to an
infinity of happiness. In the house
of the society, and surrounded by its
members, her spirit calmly took its
upward flight on the 26th of April,
1784. Her last advice to her little
community was: "Love one another
as you have hitherto done."</p>

<p>Such, in brief, were the life and labors
of one whose name even is seldom
heard, and of whose heroic efforts
in the cause of religion and
education so little mention is made
beyond the boundaries of the locality
in which she wrought and which she
sanctified. Judging her by the sacrifices
she made, there may be found
many even of our own day equally
meritorious; but considering the age
in which she worked, the dangers
and difficulties which constantly
beset her path, the invincible energy
with which she surmounted all obstacles,
and the widespread and beneficent
character of the results of her
thirty years' toil, we may assuredly
place her among the most remarkable

<h3>GRACE SEYMOUR'S MISSION.</h3>


<p>In a small village of New England,
elm-shaded and far from the
resorts of travellers, there lived, a
great many years ago, two people in
easy circumstances, the owners of a
lovely cottage&mdash;a father and his only
daughter.</p>

<p>They were well descended, and
fully showed it; moreover, the girl's
mother had been an Englishwoman
of high birth, the daughter of a great
house which, in the past, had also
been allied to that of the man she
married. Edward Seymour had
once been the pastor and the favorite
of the village of Walcot, an upright,
believing, uncompromising Calvinist,
a kind of Cromwell with all the ambition
turned heavenwards, and all
the hardness tempered by a warm,
generous nature. His wife also had
been a vigorous believer in the same
theology. Sprung from a family
noted for its "Low Church" views
in England, she had been strongly
interested in the narrative of the
American missionary, in the days
when he, fresh from the university,
and filled with vehement but practical
enthusiasm, had gone to the
"mother country" on a tour of alms-asking
and receiving. From interest
sprang attraction; then love,
with its impulsive and whole-hearted
logic, rushed in and pleaded the
cause of the disciple with that of the
religion, and suggested forcibly that a
fortune thrown at the feet of the
minister would eventually find its
way to the feet of God. Sweet argument
of the heart! though in this
case an argument misapplied.</p>

<p>So it fell out that, despite warnings
and shakings of heads and holding up
of hands, Elizabeth Howard and her
fortune (not a princely one, though)
crossed the seas, and Edward Seymour
presented a fair young foreign
enthusiast to his congregation as his
beloved and hard-won bride, under
the fire of a rude battery of eyes belonging
to the startled maidens whose
charms had long since (in their own
individual minds, at least) been destined
for the minister's solace and
support. She won her way into the
hearts of all, this young English Calvinist,
full of pure-hearted sincerity,
gentle yet steadfast as "Priscilla, the
Puritan maiden," courageous in self-denial
that the poor might profit by
her privations, a confidant the most
unhappy ever found sympathetic, and
the most guilty, indulgent. Her
husband used to say of her that
the Scriptures had never received
a more fitting and perfect fulfilment,
a more ideal accomplishment of
true womanhood, as set forth in
the many sentences where wise and
holy women are depicted, than Elizabeth
had proved herself to be.</p>

<p>In household matters she was no
less at home than in those graver
concerns of the parish and the soul-life
of her husband's spiritual people.
A good deal of the old earnestness
regarding religious truth remained
in the little favored community of
Walcot, and serious, intelligent investigation
was one of the many sturdy
though reverential habits of thought
that yet lingered with these world-forgotten
villages. To Seymour
himself the place was a paradise;
the work was not such as to overtax
his bodily strength to that degree
that leaves but little energy for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[Pg 669]</a></span>
the intellectual requirements of his
calling; neither was the stress upon
his imagination so unwholesomely
great as it is with too many of his
successors, whose brain, in order
to froth up according to their Sunday
audience's expectations, must
be in a moral ferment for the previous
six days of the week. His
wife, no frivolous gossip to whom
tea and petty scandal are dear, no
mere drudge from whom household
cares have worn away the bloom of
poetry and the freshness of early enthusiasm,
was to him a living guide, a
true helpmate, bearing his burdens
and sharing his joys, a gospel-law
written in sweetest, most natural human
characters, and a most winning,
womanly embodiment of the stern
and glorious word "Excelsior."</p>

<p>Was it a reward for <em>her</em> many virtues,
or a trial for <em>his</em> strong and
faithful nature, that God should call
her hence, and close the book abruptly
which had been to her husband
a living commentary on the
divine law? Yet it happened so,
but not at the outset of their purified
love-career; for when Elizabeth Seymour
came to die, she saw not only
her husband near her, with faith subduing
sorrow in his inspired eyes,
but two children, one a girl of fifteen,
the other a boy of four years,
the only ones she had had, but upon
whom she had lavished the holy mother-love
that would have been intense
still for each had her children
numbered as many as the sons of
Jacob.</p>

<p>Grace&mdash;she had been called so because
it was through earnest prayer
alone that her mother had survived
her birth&mdash;was holding her father's
hand, while his other one and her
own were clasped in the dying
woman's wasted fingers; and as the
little one at her feet pulled unconsciously
at her long dress, she felt her
heart throb strangely, solemnly, when
her mother said:</p>

<p>"Grace, I leave you my place; be
a helpmate to your father, be a mother
to little George. Bring him up a
brave, Christian man, like <em>his</em> father&mdash;like
<em>my</em> father, for whom he is named.
Never let him do wrong, though the
greatest worldly advantages might
be the result. Remember that, my
child; offer your life to the Lord
sooner than see your brother offend
him. God bless you, my precious
Grace!"</p>

<p>The sick woman turned her longing
eyes earnestly upon her husband,
and he, half kneeling, sank on the
floor, and supported her head on his
shoulder. The burden was featherlight,
but the strong man shook and
swayed as in mortal weakness, and
his voice was low and broken. Grace
took the child's hand, and turned
away. Those last moments were too
sacred even for a daughter's eye to
gaze upon; angels alone listened to
the secret heart-speech of those two,
whose lives had been as the two
strands of one rope. They had been
all in all to each other. The husband's
love, if the greatest, had not been
the less faithful; but the burden was
now for him, the reward for her.
Strange dispensation&mdash;and yet one
that no lover would alter if he could&mdash;that
the deepest love should be
but an earnest of the deepest suffering;
that the higher the heart goes
in its sublime learning, the greater
should be its privilege of agony.
And yet this thorny path is a very
Via Triumphalis, and those who
tread it would not give one drop of
the royal purple that dyes their weary
feet for all the kingly mantles of rare
and costly hue that grace the throne
of the earthly monarch or strew the
path of the earthly victor. Edward
Seymour had a double right to this
brotherhood of sublimest sorrow;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[Pg 670]</a></span>
for in his heart his love had grown
so strong that not once, but many
times, it had held unholy struggles
with the higher, wider Love, to whom
he had vowed himself from his childhood,
and he had had to wrestle
mightily with its strength, and had
only overcome because, after all, the
enemy he fought was human, and
the weapons he used were of God's
eternal fashioning. In Elizabeth's
calmer, more even nature, love had
never risen to that height; it had
flowed a tranquil stream in the channel
of duty, and, if deep, had never
been turbulent. The trial had never
come to her which had threatened
shipwreck to her husband; she had
never even known of it, for it had
been the <em>one</em> secret of his frank and
pure life. The awful moment came
at last; Grace and little George had
come nearer again, and all three
said afterwards that "Jesus" was the
last sound that passed the dying
woman's lips. For a few minutes a
trembling stillness reigned; it was as
if those left behind were listening to
the feet of the bearer-angels that had
come to carry their mate away.
Could they but have listened at the
same time to the wondrous revelation
of lightning-like truth that flashed
from those angels' solemn eyes, and
transformed the blind belief of the
living woman into the exultant faith
of the heaven-illumined Catholic!
Strange and awful thought! that
those from whose mortal sight the
scales have only just been taken by
death should, on the instant, enter
into such communion with the unknown,
unsuspected truth, and be
borne so far deeper in its blessed
knowledge than those who spend
lives of long and humble search on
earth. Elizabeth Seymour knew now
where truth had always been, and
yet she must look with spirit-eyes
on her loved ones bending over her
beautiful, senseless body, all unconscious
of that truth, all unknowing
of their dark and dangerous pathway.
Would her agonized prayers ever
bring them to her new resting-place?
Would God ever allow them to join
her in the other world? And meanwhile,
the minister, with his dear burden
still in his clasped arms, lifted
his head, and poured forth a prayer
into which his very life was breathed,
ending with a passionate flinging of
his whole nature into the bosom of
the all-knowing, all-loving Father&mdash;"Thy
will be done, not mine!"</p>

<p>As he lifted the inanimate form
gently on the pillows, closed the eyes,
and pressed a kiss of all but despairing
grief upon the white, warm forehead
of the lost one, his daughter,
letting the child go, seized his hand,
and pressed it to her bosom, kissing
it passionately, as if, from the very instant
of her mother's departure, she
was taking possession of the precious
trust made over to her on the same
spot only a few short moments before.</p>

<p>He, ever mindful of others before
himself, felt his child's signal, and
pressed her hand in return, leading
her gently from the room, while the
old nurse, his wife's attendant from
her early childhood by the sunny
brooks and fragrant meadows of
Gloucestershire, performed the last
necessary duties towards the loved
remains.</p>

<p>Day after day the dead lay in a
darkened room, with flower-wreaths
framing her simple coffin, a queen in
death as she had been in life, with a
touching court about her of widows
and orphans, of mourners comforted,
of children and old men, of strong
young laborers whose minds she had
turned soul-wards, and whose reverence
for her had been little less than
that&mdash;so misconstrued by those very
men&mdash;of Catholics for a patron saint.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">[Pg 671]</a></span>
At night, when the stream of villagers
would cease, the husband and the
daughter watched hand-in-hand by
the one they could not think of as
really gone from them while her
sleeping form lay so near their own
resting-place. Now and then the
minister would say a few words, half
in soliloquy, half to his companion,
and she, with her clear, pitying gray
eyes upturned, would look at him in
dumb sympathy, and a pang would
shoot through his heart, as he read
the mother's expression in the daughter's
face. They renewed the flowers
and rearranged the internal draperies
of the coffin; they spoke in whispers,
as one does in a sick-room,
fearing to wake the happy dreamer
whom the first sleep has just come
to relieve from a load of burning
pain and constant restlessness; little
George was even allowed to bring
his quiet toys, and crawl over the
floor round the strange bed where he
was told his mother was sleeping&mdash;at
first sight of the coffin, he had asked
gravely, Was that a cradle, and
had a new baby come to play with
him?&mdash;and, in a word, the death-veiled
chamber seemed more like
home than any other part of the cottage.
Then came the last day, and
the lid was to be fastened over the
white-robed, white-crowned sleeper.
Grace brought her father a bunch
of heliotrope to lay in her mother's
hands; it had been her own and her
husband's favorite flower in life; and
just over her heart, together with a
heart-shaped paper, on which the
name "Jesus" was illuminated in
red and gold, was placed a triple tress
of hair, and attached to it a scroll
with the names of "Edward&mdash;Grace&mdash;George."
Thus something living,
something of her earthly treasures,
went down with her to the tomb;
and on the day of the great awakening,
who shall say that those tokens
will not make the wife and mother's
heart throb with a deeper joy, as she
rouses herself to meet those whose
last pledge of undying love she will
find thus laid on her breast?</p>

<p>Slowly the procession moved to
the meeting-house, and slowly on to
the churchyard; a neighboring minister
performed the simple service, and
the three bereaved ones walked immediately
behind the coffin. The
villagers were more awed by the face
of the husband than by the black-palled
coffin of the wife; and some
one remarked, "It was more as if the
minister had been walking between
two angels to the judgment-seat of
the Almighty than as if, a father and
a widower, he was leading his orphan
children to a new-made grave."</p>

<p>The silent cottage, buried under its
wealth of flowering creepers, seemed
very cold and desolate when the
mourners returned; tea was laid in
the cosey library, the blinds were
drawn up, and the little birds twittered
in the veranda; everything was
ordinary and as usual again, the
same it had been just one week ago,
the day before <em>she</em> died; but it seemed
so different! Mr. Seymour threw himself
in an arm-chair by the window,
and took up a paper-knife mechanically;
little George had been taken
up-stairs, and the third chair at the
tea-table was for the kind clergyman
who had come to help his brother in
his affliction.</p>

<p>Grace had taken off her bonnet
and shawl, and was making tea in
the tea-pot that, together with the
high, old-fashioned English urn, had
been one of her mother's most cherished
wedding-gifts. Tears came to
her eyes and blinded her, and her
hand shook as she touched the tea-caddy
of old English oak and
wrought iron. Still, with all these
homely mementos rendering her
sad inauguration of new duties sad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[Pg 672]</a></span>der
still, she bravely thought of her
trust, and struggled successfully to be
calm, at least in outward seeming.
Her father's friend now came in, and
sat down in silence in a low chair
opposite Mr. Seymour. Grace laid
her hand on her father's arm:</p>

<p>"Will you have your tea here by
the window, on the little, low table?"
she said tremulously.</p>

<p>"No, my pet," he answered, taking
her hand, and stroking it gently; "let
us sit down together, as usual." And
he led her to her new place at the
head, as if he wished her to see that
he would not shrink from the everyday
details of sorrow that each triviality
of life would be too certain to
throw into relief.</p>

<p>They made no pretence of talking
beyond the few necessary questions
of even the smallest assemblage at
tea; but when Mr. Ashmead, their
guest and the minister of the neighboring
parish, said that he thought he
must leave on the morrow early, both
his host and his young, grave hostess
begged he would stay for a few more
days, till next Sunday even, if he
could.</p>

<p>And so the new life began&mdash;the
life we meant to start with at the
beginning of our story, but which has
seemed so to need its introduction,
to be so much more interesting
through it, that we could not help
putting in this long, explanatory prelude.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The long days of winter passed,
and a year was gone since the day
that saw Elizabeth Seymour's burial.
Grace was growing tall and womanly,
and had taken her mother's place
with as great seriousness as success.
She it was who taught her little
brother all he was capable of learning
at his age; she who helped the
worn-out teacher in the school; she
who copied out her father's sermons,
and looked out his texts and quotations.</p>

<p>The father and daughter, now knit
together by a doubly tender tie, and
fully realizing all its happy solemnity,
turned to the welcome occupations
of study to fill the many vacant hours
their duties allowed them. Mr. Seymour's
library was extensive, and
every month brought from Boston
some valuable and interesting additions.
Of course, theology figured
mainly among the subjects treated of
in these old and new books; but not
alone the theology of his own sect,
for he had the early fathers' magnificent
works, those Thebaids of literature
where the vastness of the seemingly
endless desert is only a veil for
the innumerable caves of deepest
science, and hidden recesses filled
with most beautiful dogmas. The
councils, too, were not unrepresented
on his shelves, though the earlier
ones were to him the best known
and the least obnoxious. Among
them was a dusty little book, in
ancient type, evidently a very hermit
of a book, whose solitude had not
been disturbed since, by some accident,
it had once made its way
there among the miscellaneous collection
of a small library purchased
nearly twenty years ago. We may
have occasion to refer to it again.</p>

<p>Mr. Seymour, confident of the
truth of his own doctrines, never hesitated
to simulate doubts and ask
questions, or propound religious problems
for the further mental training
of his daughter's inquiring disposition;
but this habit of constant investigation
at last produced in her a tumult
of the brain which she found
she no longer had the power to quell.
Questions forced themselves upon
her, doubts wrestled for mastery in
her mind, all things began to take
strange, hitherto undreamt-of shapes,
and truths, elusory yet alluring,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">[Pg 673]</a></span>
seemed to rise out of axioms which
she thought she had long ago laid
aside as proved and dangerous errors.
She strove to hold on to her once
blind and unreasoning acceptance of
her father's teaching. She would have
welcomed any superstition, could it
only have promised her peace; but
the restless spirit, once roused in her,
hurried her remorselessly, till at last,
in sheer despair, she turned to sweeping
and systematic denial of everything
she had been taught to look
upon as truth.</p>

<p>At first she did not speak to her
father about these strange experiences;
she clung to the idea that it
was physical excitement, a fever of
the brain, which would subside and
let her see her landmarks plainly
once more. But the tempest grew
wilder and more hopeless; questions
rose up, and would not be crushed
out of existence&mdash;faced her and
mocked her, and would not be answered
by the catechism formulas
she strove to oppose to them; her
life seemed resolving itself into an
eternal, tormenting, unspoken, but
ever suggested "why?" that rose
and took the shape of a demon she
could not lay nor yet would listen
to. Importunate voices were all
around her, chasms opened on every
side; and while she taught her little
brother, and wrote out her father's sermons,
it seemed as if a stern and
pitiless query sounded within her
very heart, demanding why she abetted
the enslaving of other minds to
codes of which she herself felt the
utter insufficiency. The keenest misery
to her was that this mocking voice,
whose every vibration pulled down
a stone of her former religious temple,
and sent it echoing in hollow
tones of fiendish triumph down the
recesses and depths of her torn heart&mdash;this
voice never suggested one
idea upon which she might have
seized and made the corner-stone
of a new organization of truth.
The strange demon that beset her
seemed, to her agonized mind, the
spirit of heartless destruction only,
not even of the most perishable and
paltry substitution. Hollow, empty,
heartless, seemed life to her; faith
gone, or proved an illusion good
only for those whose weak brain
could not bear the spiritual loneliness
of unbelief; the world a charnel-house,
in which death-doomed fools
quarrelled about precedence in another
world, whose very existence was
a myth of their own miserable creation;
life a journey aimless and useless,
and the faiths men carried
through it only so many wind-threatened
torches they bore for
their own deception&mdash;was this all,
was this the beginning and the end?
Blindly her heart cried out, "Somewhere
there must be a God, somewhere
there must be happiness!"
and the fiend within her brain made
answer: "There is no God save the
one the coward imagines; there is no
happiness save that which the fool
finds in ignorance."</p>

<p>One day, after many months of
this life-wearing struggle, Grace
spoke of her state to her father; and
strange indeed was the shock to
the earnest, clear-thinking minister.
Grave and tender, he tried to handle
the wounded child, but Grace was
not to be soothed into faith; it was
conviction she required. Firmly
yet patiently she heard him, and answered:</p>

<p>"All that I have said to myself,
but it is of no avail."</p>

<p>He tried to speak to her of her
mother&mdash;of her belief, her unwavering
hope in God, her sure knowledge of
Jesus, her feeling of rock-bound security
at the moment of her death;
but to all this Grace answered: "I
know it all, but I cannot feel it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[Pg 674]</a></span>
tell me something else, something
more."</p>

<p>Then the father, roused out of his
half-hopeful state as to her difficulties,
and out of his hitherto so sweet reliance
upon her kindred strength,
turned to the dogmatic aspect of his
faith, and prayed fervently that the
Lord would open his child's eyes
once more, and draw her in out of
the cold desert where her soul wandered,
a shivering stranger. But, alas!
those apparently clear-cut arguments,
those knife-like dogmas, so trenchant,
so uncompromising, those technicalities
of crystallized religion, so satisfying
to the old exiles and first settlers of
New England, fell unheeded on the
ear of Grace, who, had she believed
them, would have been as competent
a teacher of them as her own father,
as far as her thorough knowledge of
their slightest details went. Mr.
Seymour was trying to do God's
work; he was trying to <em>create</em>, to give
life to a lifeless organization, to put
a quivering human soul into a shapely
but ice-cold form.</p>

<p>Grace had once said she did not
want example nor personal experience,
but clear, frigid demonstration.
She was right as to the seeming want
in her soul&mdash;the want of absolute, incontrovertible
truth; she was wrong
as to the fire from heaven, which
was her real want&mdash;the purely personal
gift of faith, direct from God,
which only can descend and strike
the waiting soul as a sacrifice, and
enkindle it for ever, no more to be
extinguished by error or by doubt.</p>

<p>Another year passed, and things
were unchanged. No, not unchanged,
for Mr. Seymour, in his
great anxiety to bring his daughter
back to the old belief in which he
and his ever-remembered wife had
been so carefully reared, had explored
hitherto sealed books and
commentaries in the vain hope that,
since none of the old arguments
touched her, some newly suggested
ones might. He did not expect to
find anything in these works which
would strike <em>him</em> as either proving or
disproving his settled belief; still, he
thought chance might throw into
his hands some demonstration that
would have the desired effect upon
Grace. She seemed to be inclined
to magnify beyond his utmost powers
of toleration the absolute independence
and free will of man; she proudly
took her stand on human reason,
insisting that if there were a creative
God, and if it were really he who had
given reason to man, it followed that
this regal gift must be allowed full
play in determining the object of
faith. His Calvinism rebelled and
retreated to its old entrenchments,
denouncing reason as the natural
enemy of faith, as an inventive principle
ever actively evil and godless.
But he once read in a work of one of
the "great" reformers these strange
and somewhat coarse words:</p>

<p>"The devil's sole occupation is to
get the Romish priests to measure
God's will in his works, with reason."</p>

<p>He was staggered. He searched
his book-shelves for some work of
Catholic theology. As he was passing
his hand along the volumes, and
running his eye down their titles, the
little, dusty book we have mentioned
fell down. He picked it up, and,
looking at it carelessly, saw its name,
<cite>Catechism of the Council of Trent</cite>.
Curiosity at once made him forget
the first motive of his expedition
among the books, and he sat down
to examine the newly-found volume.
By and by he got interested, and
from page to page his eyes ran
eagerly, now sparkling with defiance,
now widening in astonishment, and
anon his brow contracting with intense
earnestness, as clear dogmas revealed
themselves from out the an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">[Pg 675]</a></span>cient
text&mdash;dogmas directly opposite
to his own, it is true, yet at every
moment appealing to rational and
unbiassed human nature.</p>

<p>Here man was represented as a
grand monument of God's glory, a
being worth redemption in the eyes
of God, a creature endowed with intellectual
gifts to lead him rationally
towards faith and virtue, even as he
was provided with feet to carry him
to the clear mountain-spring, and
with hands wherewith to till the
yielding, fruitful soil. Here he beheld
a humanity not degraded to
brutishness by the fall, but redeemable
through the very qualities God's
grace had yet left to it; here he saw
reconciled man's dignity and God's
majesty; here, in a word, a religion
which, claiming to be divine, was
consequently not afraid to acknowledge
and to guide the good tendencies
whose very humanness put them
beyond the pale of competition with
herself. Mr. Seymour had always
been taught to adhere to the Bible
as the one infallible rock of salvation;
he now saw the Bible merged
into a system he had once called
idolatrous, but could not at present
stigmatize as such. He determined
to read the Bible from the point of
view of the Council of Trent, for
pure intellectual curiosity's sake, he
said to himself. Alone and almost
hiding from his daughter's still hopeless
but always eager inquiries, he
began this study, with what result
would be almost useless to mention.
The Council of Trent had seemed
plausible when studied by itself; but
when referred to the book he had always
called the rule of faith, this
council was irrefutable. Could he
have been mistaken all his lifetime?
could it be that God had purposely
left him in ignorance so long? Or
was not his belief at least as good as
the faith of the Council of Trent?
But then came his clear philosophical
training to the rescue; for, it said,
how can contradictory axioms both
be true? Hitherto he had unhesitatingly
held the Catholic doctrines to
be intrinsically, nay blasphemously
untrue, and it followed that his own,
their direct contradictories, must be
right; but if, upon examination, the
reverse was evidently the case, then
his former opinions&mdash;for doctrines he
could no longer call them&mdash;must be
radically, irredeemably false. One
day he spoke to Grace about it, and
was surprised at the calm manner in
which she received a communication
whose mere rudiments had been such
a shock to him. To her mind, this
curious development of her father's
researches was a really interesting
study, quite apart from its religious
bearing, and considered principally as
a logical <i lang="fr">passe-temps</i>. But to her father
it was a heart-stirring reality,
which he pursued with all the hitherto
pent-up passion that his cold
creed had forced to run in such narrow
channels. Once he said to his
child:</p>

<p>"Grace, I used to believe the Bible
was the only rule of faith; but I
never saw that the Bible presupposed
a church, a heaven-ordained society
to shelter it from the conflicting
explanations and interpolations of
men; presupposed, also, a willing
obedience on the part of the faithful
to believe it as it is written, not a desire
to shrink from its plain teachings
and explain away its doctrines.
How could we, without a church to
interpret it to us, be sure that we
were not following some far-fetched
human adaptation of its teaching, or
pandering to some cowardly modification
of its code of morals? No;
the Bible presupposes the church,
and, without it, would be more of a
dead letter than the Hebrew is a
dead language."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[Pg 676]</a></span></p>

<p>Grace was silent, and wondered.
Her own feelings were as unsettled
as ever, but she tried to live less in
her own hopeless struggle than in the
noble, fruitful, self-forgetting life that
was dawning for her father. As his
convictions grew deeper and took
stronger root, his anxiety for his child
waxed more and more terrible. Would
the grace of God that had come to
him through the yellow pages of an
old book never touch her with its
rod of power? Had reason no influence
on her logical-seeming mind,
had sentiment no power on her undoubtedly
loving heart? She went
about her self-imposed duties as
usual, bringing consolation wherever
she went, cheering others with words
that were powerless to cheer her own
heart, kind and considerate to the
poor, amiable to all. Her father,
smitten with dread as to her bodily
as well as spiritual welfare, asked
himself how he could expose her at
this moment to the poverty that
must result from the only step he
knew he ought to take. To leave
Walcot as a convert meant to throw
himself and his children&mdash;Grace especially&mdash;into
the most absolute penury.
He could endure it, George
would hardly feel it, but his daughter,
brave and affectionate as she
was, could her shattered heart bear
up under so unexpected a necessity?
So he cheated himself and hesitated
yet; but the evil spirit was to be defeated
soon. God could not allow
his returning son and no longer
blinded servant to wander long in
human weakness outside the holy
fold.</p>

<p>Grace was sitting at a reading-desk
in her father's library one Sunday
evening in June, the purple sunset
streaming in and giving the lilacs a
deeper hue, and the laburnums a more
burnished shade, when a young man
swung open the garden gate, and,
with free and unfettered step, almost
ran up to the house-door.</p>

<p>Seeing he was a stranger and a
gentleman, Mr. Seymour opened the
library window, and leaned out, saying
in a courteous tone:</p>

<p>"I am Mr. Seymour, if you are
looking for me. I'll let you in directly."</p>

<p>The young man paused with his
hand on the door-knocker, and waited
till his host came round.</p>

<p>"You must excuse my abruptness,"
he said pleasantly, as he handed his
card to Mr. Seymour. "I am already
presuming on a relationship you may
choose to ignore."</p>

<p>"Why ignore it? The nephew of
my dear wife is as welcome to my
house as if he were my own son,"
answered Mr. Seymour, laying the
card on the table. "Come," he continued,
"let us be at home at once.
I'll introduce you to my daughter,
your cousin."</p>

<p>They went into the library together,
and the father, turning to
Grace, said:</p>

<p>"Here is a cousin from over the
sea, child&mdash;George Charteris."</p>

<p>Grace had heard her mother talk
of her younger sister's marriage to a
Mr. Charteris years before she herself
was married, so the name was familiar
to her.</p>

<p>"I wish, my boy," said the host,
"that God had spared your dear
aunt to see you here; but he knows
best. And you have come to stay
with us a little before you go home
again, I hope? Have you seen anything
yet?"</p>

<p>"I only landed in Boston yesterday,"
answered the young man, "and
have had hard work to get here so
soon. I came on business, to tell
the truth."</p>

<p>"Really!"</p>

<p>"You see, letters are very uncertain;
and I just felt in the humor, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[Pg 677]</a></span>
I came across myself. I have got
important papers for you. My uncle,
George Howard, died five weeks
ago at his place in Gloucestershire,
and, as he left no children, the estate
goes to the next of kin&mdash;your son,
George Seymour."</p>

<p>Grace and her father looked at
each other in solemn, strange wonderment.</p>

<p>"My son!" he said slowly, "my
son!"</p>

<p>"Yes, the son of the eldest sister.
My mother was the younger sister,
you know. And so I came over
about it; I am supposed to be a
lawyer, but the fact is, business is
not overpowering with us young fellows,
and, as I had enough money to
spare, I thought I would sooner go
myself than pay a man to make a
mess of it. You and my father are
appointed guardians during the minority
of the heir."</p>

<p>"And they will expect him to go
and live in England?" said the
father thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Of course; will there be any
difficulty about that?"</p>

<p>Seymour did not reply; he only
glanced at his daughter with an awed
expression about his face. She was
looking at him intently. Young
Charteris noticed how ill she seemed.</p>

<p>The rest of the evening passed very
sociably, and, having shown his young
guest his room, Seymour returned in
his dressing-gown and slippers to the
library. Grace stole in softly, still
dressed, and looking anxious. She
drew a chair beside him, and, taking
his hand in her own, said solemnly:</p>

<p>"Dear father, it was ordained we
should leave this place."</p>

<p>"Was such <em>your</em> idea also, my
child?" her father asked.</p>

<p>"Of course; and if I have not
spoken of it before, my dear father,
it was only because I was waiting for
<em>you</em> to mention it first."</p>

<p>It seemed a reproach! Was God
using this blind instrument to show
him more forcibly where his duty
lay?</p>

<p>"I know, father," continued Grace,
"what that means for you in the
circumstances you newly stand in.
It means that you will not be allowed
to be guardian to your son, that
you will be denied access to him,
that he will be brought up a Protestant
before your eyes, and that practically
you will be as homeless as the
outcast you would have made yourself
from this village and this church.
But remember, whatever happens,
Grace is always with you&mdash;will always
be, whether she believes or not, happy
or wretched, poor or rich, until
it shall be your own pleasure to drive
her from your side. Although thy
God may not be my God, yet thy
people shall be my people, and we
will stand or fall together!"</p>

<p>"My brave child!" was all the
father could answer through his
tears.</p>

<p>"But, father dearest," she resumed
in a quick, decided voice, "if George
is to be brought up as you wish, the
first thing to secure is his being
rightly baptized; and you can do that
this very next day. I shall be allowed
to see George, and thus my mother's
trust will be in my hands yet."</p>

<p>"O my girl! it is hard, you cannot
tell how hard."</p>

<p>"I have lost what you have won,
father. Think you the loss of faith
a lesser evil than the changing of it?"</p>

<p>"Poor child! poor child! God
grant you may see it one day."</p>

<p>"God grant I may," she answered
frankly, "if it be the truth."</p>

<p>They spoke far into the night, and
Seymour determined to announce
from the pulpit next Sunday his
unshaken conviction of the truth of
the Catholic faith, and to take a final
leave of his congregation. Young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[Pg 678]</a></span>
Charteris knew nothing of it.
George was baptized the following
morning. The week passed by, and
the young English cousin was more
than ever attracted by the strange,
silent, preoccupied manner and the
serious, anxious beauty of his girl-companion.
A gay young man, with
hardly any surface of religion about
him, he yet had that deep observative
faculty which renders some men's
perceptions so acute and true in the
field of religion. Half an unbeliever
himself for fashion's sake, he was yet
quick to detect how really far from
unbelief the seemingly cold, doubting
girl's heart was; and he smiled to
himself as he shrewdly thought how
both Puritanism and this present
phase of feeling would be rudely
shaken when brought face to face
with the hot-pressed life of wealthy,
bewildering London. But something
whispered to him that neither father
nor daughter would allow the brilliant
world to stand between them
and their convictions, whatever those
might be. Meanwhile, Charteris
romped with little George, who was
wisely kept in ignorance as to his
new honors, and the days sped fast
towards the eventful Sunday which
was to have so strange and stormy
an ending.</p>

<p>The Saturday previous, Mr. Seymour
sat at the window of his library,
in his favorite arm-chair, his daughter
leaning her head upon his knee, and
holding one of his hands clasped to
her bosom. For a long time there
was a silence; then, like the evening
breeze just born among the tree-tops,
a faint whisper of conversation began
to stir the quiet of the darkened
room. The sun was gone down, and
the crescent moon was rising in white
mistiness behind the shrubbery.</p>

<p>"It was just such a night, Grace,"
said the minister, "that we sat here
with Ashmead more than two years
ago&mdash;the day we began our new life
without your dear mother; and now
we have turned another leaf already,
and are on the threshold of another
new life!"</p>

<p>"Yes, my own darling," said his
child; "but it is not without me that
you are going to begin it. In any
case, I shall never leave you. And
if we are parted from little George,
why, what can we do but cling more
and more to each other?"</p>

<p>"Have you thought, Grace, that
it may be a life of toil that we are
going to meet?" asked her father
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Father dearest, would my mother
have shrunk from entering it with
you? And do you think <em>I</em> love you
less than she did?"</p>

<p>"My brave girl!" he answered,
with a soft light coming into his
dreamy eyes. Presently he said:
"But, Grace, you will have little
consolation, little support, for my
principles are leading me; but you?"</p>

<p>"My love for you is <em>my</em> guide!"
she said fervently.</p>

<p>"Truly, my child, you are even as
Ruth, who clung to Naomi for very
love, and thereby reaped the reward
of faith. God grant you may be led
to the same end through my humble
instrumentality."</p>

<p>There was a pause. The father,
after a few moments' earnest thought,
spoke again.</p>

<p>"Grace, darling," he said, and she
started, as if collecting her runaway
thoughts.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, with a loving
look.</p>

<p>"Do not blame me for speaking
abruptly, Grace," her father resumed;
"for circumstances are such as allow
us little spare time for forms of
speech. Has it ever struck you that
you will most likely marry? And
have you noticed your cousin's manner
towards you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">[Pg 679]</a></span></p>

<p>At the first hint of marriage Grace
had lifted her great, startled eyes to
her father's face; then, on the second
and more personal question, she
looked quickly down, and a burning
blush came like sunset hues over her
usually pale cheeks. But she never
hesitated nor wavered in her answer,
for the blush was more that of surprise
than consciousness.</p>

<p>"I never thought of my cousin in
that way. Did <em>you</em>? And I have
thought vaguely some day I might
be a good man's wife&mdash;a minister's,
most likely; but now these strange
doubts have come to me, I could
have no peace in any new relation in
life. In conscience, my father, I
could enter upon none."</p>

<p>"Well, child, I am glad so far.
But if your cousin had many opportunities,
depend upon it he would
love you. I only say this to caution
you. You know your own heart;
you know I could approve such a
marriage under certain circumstances,
always provided you do not
come to the happy truth I have
reached. Now, you can act as your
conscience and your reason impel
you; but it is always better, I think,
to work in the full daylight."</p>

<p>"I could not marry as I am now.
Besides, I could not leave you."</p>

<p>"You might have to leave me."</p>

<p>"Father!" cried the girl, startled.</p>

<p>"Never mind," he said soothingly,
but not offering to explain himself,
and then went on: "Supposing a thing
to be possible, still, in the case that
you remained out of the church,
would you let your cousin be your
helpmate and your protector?"</p>

<p>"If you wish it, I will think of it,
and question my own heart," said
Grace; but the words were measured,
and the tone was cold. Her father
felt it.</p>

<p>"Grace, I did not wish to hurt
you, child. I cannot tell you all
I meant, for I hardly discern yet
what is God's voice within me, and
what the voice of my own earthly
enthusiasm, perhaps even ambition.
But, my own precious daughter, our
hearts will always be one; and after
God, there is no one on earth more
dear to me than you are."</p>

<p>Grace laid her head on her father's
knee again.</p>

<p>"So if your cousin Charteris
should speak to you on the subject
of marriage before your views of religion
are changed, you will answer
deliberately and calmly, will you not,
having searched your innermost
feelings well?" said the father.</p>

<p>"I will," said Grace firmly.</p>

<p>The next day dawned fair and
bright; the very air had a holiday
feel about its quiet, fresh-scented
crispness; the birds sang softly in the
vivid-painted trees, and it seemed as
if nature had reserved a very jubilee
of delights for the lovely summer
afternoon. Crowds came soberly to
church, the children glancing longingly
at the tempting hedges, the young
people now and then looking into
each other's eyes the things they
dared not put in words, and would
have spoilt in the saying had they
done so; to some, older and more
spiritually-minded persons, came, on
the fragrant breeze, faint suggestions
of the fabled millennium, in which
they believed with the grasping
faith of disappointed souls; to all
came, on the wings of this Sunday
morning, impressions of peace, of
happiness; perceptions of a life
holier and higher than that of the
present; vague stirrings of the soul,
as if some mystery, both dread and
beautiful, were coming out to meet
them from the unusual radiance of
this never-to-be-forgotten day.</p>

<p>Very solemn indeed did the day's
brightness seem to the earnest minister;
a new bridal, far different from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[Pg 680]</a></span>
the bridal eighteen years before in
the very country for which he was now
again bound&mdash;a bridal of the soul
with sorrow and with sacrifice, a taking
up of the crown of thorns and
the cross of dereliction. He would
walk into the old meeting-house, a
hero among his people; he would
leave it, an outcast and a leper
among his brethren. He would meet
his flock a revered pastor, an acknowledged
guide; he would go out
of that pulpit, his no longer, an exile,
a suspected impostor, an accursed
and condemned man. And not
there only was the sting; beyond
and far above it was the human
sense of deep humiliation at having
to unsay his teaching, to renounce
the doctrines he had taught for twenty
years, to warn his people of the
very faith he had believed in from
his cradle. It is no slight thing for
a man, learned and looked up to, an
eager and practical theologian, to
stand before a congregation of intelligent,
sharp-witted hearers, and say,
"I was mistaken!" For when you
feel that every word you speak is
changed, as it falls on their ears, into
a barbed weapon against yourself,
and will be handled by remorseless
and unsympathizing fellow-men until
twisted into meanings you never
dreamed of and deceptions you
would scorn, then it is that the
painful, human side of the great and
heroic sacrifice is revealed, and that
our fleshly weakness has to turn perforce
in helpless and blind reliance
upon God.</p>

<p>Solemn also, and far sadder, seemed
the glorious beauty of that Sunday
morning to Grace Seymour by
her open window, through which came
the scent of lilacs and blossoming
horse-chestnuts; her books ranged in
melancholy silence on the shelf
above the mantel, the old family
Bible lying solitary and unopened on
a little table by itself, an air of desolateness
hanging over the simple, innocent-looking
room, with its chintz
hangings and two or three old prints
and faded pictures. Some were of
sacred subjects, and these, unless this
were the spectator's fancy, seemed
more forlorn than any others; Grace
herself thought so sometimes, as she
would give a pathetic survey to the
room that had known no change
since her childhood, save when the
great change of death had wafted into
it some of the old mementos of
her English mother's youth.</p>

<p>On the eve of this last change, that
was almost another death, the young
girl sat with clasped hands on the
wide window-sill, and gazed with sad
yet steadfast eyes on the beauty of
the breaking day. To her it was
indeed a setting forth on a journey
without scrip or staff, without guide
or compass. In her love for her
father, she gloried in his grand, manly
act, though it drove her forth into
the desert world; but though she rejoiced
at his stern following of principle,
as at a deed of heroism in itself,
yet what comfort was there for her in
the dreary waste of an untried world?
To set out on the road to heaven,
leaving the paths of men, was one
thing; but to leave the known for the
unknown, the real life of human sympathy
for a dark, companionless one
among things that were only shadows
and mocking figures of mist&mdash;what
was that? And would human love
carry her through? Could she follow,
by the glow-worm light of an earthly
though hallowed feeling, the same
path in which a fiery pillar preceded
her father's soul, and angels guided
his footsteps? But come what might,
she would try; so she had resolved
from the beginning. Besides, was it
not she who had, according to the
instinct of her true nature, decided
for her father the step his own con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">[Pg 681]</a></span>science
had counselled, but from which
his human love still weakly recoiled?
And, therefore, was she not bound to
share his fortunes, even though love
had not impelled her to do so? She
could not pray that this day's work
might end in good, she could not
pray for strength or guidance; she
could only helplessly gaze upon the
familiar home-scene she had watched
so often from that window&mdash;the spread
of orchard and garden and meadow-land
beyond, the golden lights flickering
among the shrubs, and playing
with the soft, changing shadows&mdash;all
the beauty that had been her soul's
book for years, and was now the only
book she could still read and love as
of old. A sort of dumb prayer was
that wistful gaze, the hopeless, half-conscious
murmur of paralyzed lips
striving to form once more sounds
that long ago, they remember, used
to mean <em>something</em> to the understanding.
Little George at this moment
ran across the lawn after a yellow
butterfly, and looked up fearfully at
the library-window, as if expecting to
be reproved for such unwonted exercise
on the sacred day.</p>

<p>Grace started and looked at her
watch. It was time; the bells had
been ringing some minutes, and the
hour was drawing nigh. She stole
down to her father's side, very solemn
and quiet, and took his hand. He
turned and clasped her in his arms.</p>

<p>"God will bless you yet, my little
one," he said, with an earnest look
into her brave eyes, "for all you are
to me."</p>

<p>Hand-in-hand they walked the
short distance between their cottage
and the meeting-house. The great
trees stood protectingly round the
little church, shading it like a temple,
with broad shadows flung like curtains
before its doors, as if to supplement
the bareness in which human
hands had left it. The people were
crowding in; some stepped aside as
the minister passed, making room
for him; others nodded to him, and
were startled at the unwonted look
in his far-searching eyes. Grace, on
the contrary, seemed almost defiant,
as if she thought of nothing save the
storm which one short hour would
bring about her darling's head. The
congregation seated themselves with
that undertone of quiet rustling peculiar
to country audiences. Grace
sat directly facing her father; but she
had turned herself so that her features
were visible to those who sat
in the nearest pews behind. Edward
Seymour slowly came up the pulpit
stairs, and stood before his people.
One long, sweeping glance he gave
them, then his eyes went upward, and
a light came into them, as of something
more than human.</p>

<p>The crowd was thrilled, and men
and women gazed at each other inquiringly.</p>

<p>Then he began: "My friends, I
have come to say farewell to you.
This is no sermon, but an explanation
which is due to you. I am not
going to leave you for the city, nor
for another flock, nor for the retirement
of a college-life. It is not a man
who has called me, it is not the world
or my own interests that have bidden
me leave you; it is God.</p>

<p>"Truly, 'God's ways are not our
ways, nor his thoughts our thoughts.'
If you will bear with me, I will show
you how this has been borne in upon
me, and will give you, what you have
a right to hear, the brief history of
the change which is calling me away
from you."</p>

<p>The interest of his hearers was
acutely, if not painfully, awakened;
every one waited breathlessly for the
novel experiences of one who had
always seemed so strong in the belief
he taught. Some thought he
had turned to the Methodist views,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">[Pg 682]</a></span>
some suspected him of Episcopalian
leanings; of the truth, not one had
the slightest inkling, for, to their
minds, such a change was more irrational
than suicide, and more awful
a judgment than insanity.</p>

<p>Step by step, with clear, sharp-cutting
words, he developed the doubts
and fears of his soul; he dissected
his life for the last year, and showered
Bible texts upon his hearers in
his rapid way that would have been
impassioned had he let it be; and
when, one after the other, he had
sapped all the axioms his former
teaching had rested on, and had
carried the mind of his audience,
against its will, out of the sphere of
certainty, he then paused a moment,
and said in a more gentle voice than
he had used in his dogmatic course:</p>

<p>"And now, my friends, what remains
to be said? This: to confess
my mistake before you all, to humble
myself at the feet of God, whom
I have so long misunderstood and
mistaught, and to ask your forgiveness
for having given you, in my ignorance,
stones when you asked for
bread, serpents when you cried for
food. You know the church which
alone teaches all that God has now
shown me to be true; you know that
it is a church flouted and condemned,
persecuted and poor&mdash;none other
than the Holy Roman Catholic
Church (here the stir was like an electric
shock among the rapt audience,
and Grace half rose up in her seat,
and looked defiance from her flashing
eyes upon her nearest neighbors),
none other than was founded in the
poverty of Bethlehem, the ignominy
of Calvary, the secrecy of the catacombs.</p>

<p>"I have but few words left to say
to you, my friends. We have walked
together for many years, seeking
God. I knew not that I had not
found him; <em>now</em> I know that I walked
in darkness and in the shadow of
death. I pray that each of you, in
God's appointed time, may be led,
like me, to find him. I thank him
that this grace should come with
sorrow, exile, and poverty in its train.
I take up the cross willingly, and
leave home and country, and a beloved
grave, and a people to whom
my soul was knit, to follow humbly
where God shall lead me. And
now, once again farewell, and may
God bless you, every one, and reward
you for all that your friendship
and your fidelity have ever done for
him who was once your pastor."</p>

<p>With a grave and simple salutation,
he went down the pulpit stairs,
passed out of the church, his daughter
eagerly joining him and linking
her arm in his. Her English cousin,
who had come in late to the service,
hastened after them, and frankly expressed
his astonishment at the sudden
turn of affairs. The people, who
streamed out after them in hurried
groups, as if anxious to get into the
air, that they might talk over this extraordinary
event, eyed them askance
as they walked home; the deacons
spoke together in shocked whispers,
and the older men and women
quoted texts about wolves in sheeps'
clothing. Some of the younger
church members were scared and
disturbed more by the uncompromising
arguments than by the tangible
result; while others, the reckless and
the more "unregenerate," boldly
said they admired the minister's
"pluck."</p>

<p>George Charteris dwelt very seriously
on the exclusion from the
guardianship of his son which this
course of Mr. Seymour's would inevitably
entail; but the father only
answered sadly: "The Lord did
not speak to me of such things;
those affairs are in his hands, and
his secrets are not for us to inquire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">[Pg 683]</a></span>
into. So far as I saw my way clear,
I have answered the call of God."</p>

<p>Several friends called in the evening
to speak to the minister about
the incredible announcement he had
made that morning; they found him
the same as ever, patient, kind, and
courteous, and his young daughter
more beautiful and more attractive
than before; for the determined way
in which she supported her father's
conduct gave her a touch of the
heroine.</p>

<p>Late that night the two visited
the moonlit grave near the little
church. Great elm-shadows veiled
it, and the night-wind rustled the
violet and primrose leaves that bordered
it all round. In the summer
a cross of heliotrope grew at its head,
but as yet it had been too cold to put
the plants out. In his new-found
faith, the husband could now kneel
and pray, and speak to the angel
guardian of his lost wife, and send
messages to the soul that knew all
he had so lately learnt, and knew it
so much better than he. But the
great thing of which he spoke was
the future of his children and hers,
praying that they too, especially
Grace, should be brought to the
same knowledge and saved through
the same faith. Grace stood like a
statue, her hands clasped and resting
on her father's shoulder, her
slight form bending forward as he
knelt. When he rose, she pressed
his arm and drew him towards her,
looking up into his tear-veiled eyes
with looks of hungry love. It was a
rare and a piteous sight to see the
strong man weep, to see the wave-like
emotion of this solemn hour
bow the head of the deep thinker,
the calm and kingly scholar. It
made him more sacred in her sight,
and kindled her rapturous feelings to
that degree that she could gladly
have died, that he might be spared
one pang more in his future path of
thorns.</p>

<p>He hardly suspected <em>all</em> that he
was to his child; for great though his
love was, broad, and deep, and still,
it was silent as the great ocean that
sleeps round the islands of coral, beneath
the changeless radiance of
southern constellations. But few
outward signs passed between father
and daughter, for his grand, noble
nature was self-contained and grave;
and for that very reason Grace honored
him in her heart, calling him to
herself a hero among men. Was it
strange that, by his side, other men
seemed dwarfed, that their virtues
seemed shallow, and their very vices
more contemptible than horrible?
Was it strange that his intellect, so
far-reaching, and his practical business
abilities, so clear and straight-forward,
should make other men
seem only half men, with one side of
their nature alone monstrously developed,
till it grew to overbalance
the other, and make the whole into
a grotesque travesty of humanity,
a moral satyr, more beast than man,
and more fool than either?</p>

<p>I do not say that such ungracious
thoughts came to her when she noticed
her cousin, George Charteris;
but something hollow and unreal
suggested itself to her, as she listened
to his brilliant, frivolous talk or his
cynical, off-hand observations. She
thought, if that is what modern fashion
breeds in men, the world of to-day
is no better than a smelting-furnace,
obliterating all but the changing
current of mingled ore and dross
constantly running with aimless speed
through its many channels. She
looked forward to any contact with
it as a trial, and only stayed herself
with the idea that everything noble
and pure and dignified was embodied
in her father's life, in which she
would always be wrapped up. Yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">[Pg 684]</a></span>
she had promised to think of marriage!</p>

<p>The day following this eventful
Sunday the Seymour family left Walcot.
Their cottage, which was their
own property, was to be let for a
year, as their affairs were still unsettled
and their plans quite undecided.
From that day Edward Seymour
again felt that a new journey had
begun for him; and where his soul
would be landed he knew not, nor
cared to know, so God was before
him and his daughter at his side.</p>

<h3>THE JANSENIST SCHISM IN HOLLAND.<br />

JANSENISM IN THE CHURCH OF UTRECHT.</h3>

<p class="center">FROM LES ETUDES RELIGIEUSES. BY C. VAN AKEN.</p>


<h4>I.</h4>

<p>I shall not undertake to write
the history of Netherland Jansenism.
I have a more special purpose in
view; it is to demonstrate the actual
existence of that heresy in the so-called
Church of Utrecht. To this
end, I shall, after showing what the
principles of Jansenism are, make it
clear that the errors of Baius, as developed,
or, so to say, amended, by
Jansenius, are reproduced by Quesnel,
and are to be found in the false Synod
of Pistoia. This assembly, held
in 1786, under the authority of Leopold
II., Grand Duke of Tuscany,
and presided over by Scipio Ricci,
Bishop of Pistoia and Prato, merits
our attention; for the principal documents
I shall make use of in this
paper concern the official adhesion
given by the schismatical clergy of
Holland to the synod.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> As to the
events which are related and admitted
by all historians, I shall only refer
to them in order to point out their
significance, or to dissipate the obscurity
in which the recent promoters
of the schism have sought to envelope
facts.</p>

<p>"Jansenius had been a great reader
of S. Augustine; but he brought
to the study of this author far more
of zeal than of prudence or real
knowledge. In some passages he
renders the thoughts of the Doctor
of Grace well enough; almost everywhere
else, and even in the most
important points, he is grossly in
error. An extensive reader he was
not; one author alone absorbed his
whole life, and the more he dwelt
upon his author, the less he understood
him. His posthumous work
is bad, impious, and truly heretical.
Calvin, as Jansenius presents him, is
no longer Calvin."</p>

<p>Thus writes F. Denis Petau (author
of <cite>Dogmes Théologiques</cite> and <cite>Doctrine
des Temps</cite>) to F. Bollandus,
August 9, 1641, shortly after the
publication of the celebrated <cite>Augustinus</cite>.
The Calvinists of Holland
have taken the same view as F. Petau;
for them Jansenius is an ally,
a friend, whose opinions are less opposed
to theirs in substance than in
form. Did not the Bishop of Ypres
candidly acknowledge that he "almost
entirely" approved the Calvinist
Synod of Dordrecht? The
Abbé of Saint-Cyran, another patriarch
of Jansenism, remarked: "Calvin
thought justly, but expressed
himself ill&mdash;<i lang="la">bene sensit, male locutus
est</i>." However, there are important
differences between the two heresies;
but it would take us too much out
of our way to indicate them in detail.
These words of the false Synod of
Pistoia perfectly express the germinal
idea of Jansenism: "In these
latter days a general obscurity prevails
in regard to the most important truths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">[Pg 687]</a></span>
of religion.... It is necessary, therefore,
to remount to the pure source
of the principles which have been
obscured by novelties, in order to establish
a uniformity of doctrine which
shall be a subject of edification for
the faithful, and gratify the wishes
of our most religious prince....
To establish this unity of principles,
the enlightened sovereign suggests
to the bishops to take for their rule
the doctrine of S. Augustine against
the Pelagians and the semi-Pelagians,
who, through their system, have
destroyed the spirit of the Christian
religion, and preached a new gospel."<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
It must needs follow from
this that the authority of the church
is not an efficacious remedy against
error, since it was possible for the
general belief of the faithful to be
obscured for centuries in regard to
the most important truths.</p>

<p>Is this in any wise different from
what the reformers of the XVIth
century pretended? Did not Calvin,
especially, have always in his
mouth the name of the great Bishop
of Hippo? Jansenius develops
the same thought in his preliminary
work, <cite>De Ratione et Auctoritate</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
Baius had prepared the way for him.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
For the authority of the teaching
church, always youthful and full of
life, as S. Irenæus says, the Jansenists
substituted S. Augustine, who was no
longer at hand to protest against the
abuse that had been made of his
words&mdash;words often rugged and obscure.
So much for the general
ground; let us now enter into detail.</p>

<p>Following Baius, Jansenius sets
out with this fundamental axiom,
which is, as it were, the culminating
point whence one takes in his whole
system: The complete man is not a
compound of body and soul only (as
the Catholic doctrine declares, in
consonance with sound philosophy);
but a third principle, the Holy
Ghost, the sole source of all wisdom,
of all charity, is necessary, in order
to complete the rational being, and
to render him worthy of his Creator
and of his natural destiny.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Without
this grace&mdash;for so Jansenius considered
it&mdash;body and soul constitute only
a sensual and animal being, defenceless
against all evil desires, and incapable
of rising to the knowledge
and love of good. The immediate
consequence of these principles is
that God could not create man without
bestowing upon him the Holy
Ghost and all the other gifts which
faith manifests to us in our first parents.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>These were, no doubt, so many
graces, says Jansenius; but these
graces were none the less due to
human nature, which without them
would have been incomplete.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>"The first man was created in a
state of <em>perfect</em> innocence, and could
not come forth otherwise from the
hand of God. The idea of any
other state whatever is a chimera
which would degrade humanity and
openly conflict with the perfections
of a sovereign Providence. Faith
teaches us that Adam was established
in justice and charity. He there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">[Pg 688]</a></span>fore
loved his Creator, and had within
himself no perverse inclination."<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>
Thus speak the sectaries of Pistoia,
faithful interpreters of Jansenist
thought. The church has condemned
this conclusion; she teaches us
that God could have created man as
he is born at present, without sin, to
be sure, but still without that <em>perfect</em>
innocence which consists in the supernatural
and purely gratuitous gifts of
charity and integrity.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>However, sin entered into the
world, and at one blow man lost all
the gifts of the Holy Ghost: he had
fallen into that abnormal state of
incompleteness in which God could
not have established him in the beginning.
"He hastened from darkness
to darkness, from error to error,
from sin to sin: powerless to deliver
himself from that love which held
him attached to himself."<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> But "the
infected root must (by a physical
necessity, as Jansenius says)<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> produce
defective and corrupt fruit.
He transmits to his children, therefore,
in the order of generation, ignorance
of good and a vicious inclination
to evil."<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> This is original sin,
according to the Jansenists.</p>

<p>The Catholic Church, in whose
eyes sin is above all a moral disorder,
teaches that ignorance and concupiscence
are not sins, but the consequence
of the first transgression, and
the occasion to man in his fallen
state of voluntarily committing new
sins.</p>

<p>Jansenius exaggerates from the
first the extent of the wound which
ignorance caused in us. The fallen
man, according to him, is no longer
possessed of organs for perceiving
the truths which concern the higher
interests of the soul; God, the future
life, natural right, are so many closed
books, which revelation alone can
open for us.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> This is a sort of religious
scepticism, often revived since,
and always rejected by sound theology.
It is the real source also, we
may be sure, of the peculiar mysticism
which has flourished among the
Jansenists from the beginning. By
a natural consequence, Jansenius
treats reason and science as enemies
of faith; he would have them banished
afar from theology. It is not
intelligence, says he, but memory,
and, above all, the heart, which penetrates
revelation.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Is this the same
as to say that the adversaries of the
<cite>Augustinus</cite> have opened the door to
modern rationalism, as Sainte-Beuve
insinuates? By no means. Between
the two errors lies the truth as proclaimed
by the Scriptures and the
fathers, maintained by the sovereign
pontiffs, and definitely decided in the
Holy Council of the Vatican.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>Ignorance, the fruit of sin, is itself
imputed as sin, say the Jansenists;
in other words, we are guilty before
God of the faults into which ignorance
causes us to fall unwittingly and in
spite of ourselves.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> This is also the
teaching of Scipio Ricci's false synod.
Pelagius, we are told by it, "could not
understand why the ignorance of
good which is born with us, which is
<em>necessarily</em> transmitted to us in the
order of generation, and by which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[Pg 689]</a></span>man falls into error without wishing
to, and in spite of himself&mdash;<i lang="la">invitus ac
nolens</i>&mdash;ought not to excuse sin."<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>Pelagius, who denied the fact of
the original fall, would not admit
that ignorance, the consequence of
the fall, was an evil or a weakness,
especially in view of man's supernatural
end; but faith, equally with
good sense, forbids our maintaining
that one can be guilty without willing
to be so&mdash;<i lang="la">invitus ac nolens</i>.</p>

<p>The second wound of man in his
fallen state is denominated concupiscence.
In the system of Jansenius
"it is a movement of the soul which
leads to the enjoyment of self and of
other creatures for some other end
than God. It is, therefore, an affection
of the soul contrary to order, and
<em>bad in itself</em>. Hence it is that man
without grace (that is, deprived of
grace), and under the slavery of sin,
since cupidity reigns in his heart,
whatever effort he may make to withdraw
himself from its influence, refers
everything to himself, and by
the general influence of the love
which dominates him, <em>spoils and corrupts
all his actions</em>."<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> This error of
Jansenius has been stigmatized as it
deserves in the bulls directed against
Baius and Quesnel.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> These writers
present the error under forms the
most various; for example, "All that
man does without grace is sin. All the
works of infidels are sins. The sinner,
without grace, is free only for evil."</p>

<p>According to Catholic doctrine,
man by his fall has become the slave
of sin, and has from himself only sin
and falsehood, in the sense that of
himself he is for ever incapable of justifying
himself from the stain of original
sin and from the sins he has
voluntarily committed; he can do
nothing, absolutely nothing, towards
his supernatural destiny; his weakness
is so great that, without assistance
from on high, he cannot but fall frequently
and grievously, especially
when assailed by powerful temptations.
In these truths there are motives
enough for humbling our pride,
without needing to go so far as the
Jansenists, and say that the necessity
of our sinning is an absolute and continual
necessity. This theory would
be less repulsive if, with the fathers,
the abundance of grace were also
proclaimed. Christ's redemption,
the latter tell us, embraces all time;
but his grace is more palpable to us
in these days, and more generally
diffused. Divine assistance is always
at hand, say they unanimously, at the
moment it is wanted; so that man
can at least call upon God for help,
and thus obtain the strength of which
he stands in need. Jansenius, on
the contrary, pitilessly restrains the
measure of liberating grace. Let us
hear what the Synod of Pistoia has
to say on this subject:</p>

<p>"The Lord willed that, before this
plenitude of time [the time of our Saviour's
appearance upon earth], mankind
should pass through different
states. It was his will that man,
<em>abandoned to his own lights</em>, should
learn to distrust his <em>blind reason</em>, and
that his wanderings should thus lead
him to desire the assistance of a superior
light. This was the <em>state of
nature</em> in which man knew not sin,
and suffered himself to be drawn by
concupiscence without being aware of
it."<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Thus, then, there was a long series
of centuries in which mankind in
general were abandoned to ignorance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">[Pg 690]</a></span>and cupidity, and when, without knowing
it, without wishing it, they fell from
sin to sin. Is this not frightful? But
what follows is still more cruel: "God
then gave him a law which brought
him to a knowledge of sin. But man,
being <span class="smcap">POWERLESS</span> to observe it, became
a prevaricator under the law.
Sin became even more widespread,
either because the law forbidding it
heightened the desire for it, or because
prevarication&mdash;that is, contempt of
the law&mdash;was added to its violation....
The law, therefore, was given by
God, ... not to heal the wounds of
mankind, but to acquaint him with
the malady and with the necessity of
a remedy."<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Thus viewed, the law
of Sinai is an injustice and a subject
of derision.</p>

<p>Finally, "The Son of God descended
from the bosom of his Father and
brought salvation."<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> Now, at least,
grace, like a current of life, will pass
into the veins of languishing humanity!
Alas! no; the further we advance
the more disheartening becomes
the doctrine of Jansenius.
He acknowledges at the outset that
progress in the individual follows
the same course as in the species.
I will explain his thought: many
men, even under the Christian law,
have not the gift of faith&mdash;they are
in the <em>state of nature</em>; others are enlightened
by the rays of divine revelation
or by the interior light of
grace&mdash;they are in a state analogous
to that of men under the law.
"While earthly love reigns in the
heart, the light of grace, if it be
alone, produces the same effect as
the law.... It is necessary, therefore,
that the Lord should create in
the heart a holy love, that he should
inspire it with a holy delectation, contrary
to the love which reigns there.
<em>This holy love, this holy delectation, is,
properly speaking, the grace of Jesus
Christ</em>; it is the grace of the New
Testament.... Dominant love is a
holy passion which operates in man,
in regard to God, the same effects
which dominant cupidity operates
therein in regard to the things of
earth."<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Millions of men are thus
excluded from all participation in redeeming
grace. Jansenius says distinctly
that the graces indispensable
to salvation are not accorded at all
times except to the small number of
the elect; all others receive nothing,
or only temporary and insufficient
helps, which serve but to render them
more guilty. In this sense, the Jansenists
refuse to admit that Christ
died for the eternal salvation of all
men; the predestined alone were
comprehended in the great contract
by which Jesus, in dying, offered his
life, and the Eternal Father accepted
his stainless oblation as the price of
justifying grace. It is in this sense,
also, that the fifth proposition of Jansenius
has been condemned as heretical:
"It is a semi-Pelagian error
to say that Christ died or shed his
blood for all men in general."<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>Hence arose that horrible Jansenist
doctrine of predestination, borrowed
from Calvin, in which God is
made to appear pitiless even in his
mercies, the reprobate as a victim
less guilty than unfortunate, and the
elect one as a spoiled child who
ought to blush at his immortal
crown.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>I shall return to this latter point
hereafter. Meanwhile, let us point
out another consequence of the doc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">[Pg 691]</a></span>trine
here laid down. If it be true
that man is often abandoned by
grace, and if, in consequence of his
impotence, he necessarily violates the
divine commands, must we, then, believe
that God orders what is impossible?
No doubt of it, reply the
Jansenists; Pelagius first dared to
deny this consequence&mdash;that the just
themselves do often lack necessary
grace.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> This monstrous error is expressed
in the first proposition of
Jansenius, as follows: "Some of
God's commandments are impossible
to the just in the state of their present
strength, whatever will they may
have, and whatever efforts they may
make; and the grace through which
these commandments would become
possible to them is wanting."<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> Catholics,
with the Council of Trent
(session vi. chap. xi.), say quite the
contrary. It is a doctrine universally
held in the church, and borne out
by the unanimous consent of the fathers,
that no one is deprived of the
graces indispensable to salvation, except
through his personal fault.
Theologians also, for the most part,
teach, with reason, that God confers
the grace of conversion on sinners
the most obstinate and hardened.</p>

<p>How is it that Jansenius was unable
to perceive one of the clearest
points of Christian revelation&mdash;the
infinite mercy of God towards the
sinner? It was the inevitable consequence
of his doctrine concerning
liberty.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> In his eyes, the equilibrium
of the human will has been irreparably
lost; man naturally follows the
attraction which dominates him.</p>

<p>Without grace, our poor will tends
irresistibly to the depths of sin; an
evil cupidity dominates it. But let
the delectation of divine love take
possession of this entirely passive
and powerless heart, and it will be
drawn to good by an equal necessity.
Now, we see but too well that this
holy passion which operates in man,
in regard to God, the same effects
which the dominant cupidity operates
in regard to the things of earth,
is the privilege of but a small number.
One only explanation is possible&mdash;all
the rest are without grace.
Be it observed that, according to the
Jansenists, every grace is charity, irresistible,
victorious delectation. The
<cite>Augustinus</cite>, it is true, speaks of certain
<em>little</em> graces which do not at
once carry the soul to the heights of
perfection. Such as they are, they
are none the less efficacious; if their
power is not greater, it is because
God has not given them more force
than they in effect possess. The
grace called by the theologians <em>sufficient</em>
is held in aversion by the Jansenists;
it is a grace which has for
them the demerit of not being efficacious.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>
The three following propositions
from Jansenius on liberty and
grace have been pronounced heretical:</p>

<p>"In order to merit or demerit in
the state of fallen nature, it is not
necessary that man should have a
liberty opposed to necessity (as to
willing); it suffices that he should
have a liberty opposed to constraint."<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
"In the state of fallen
nature, we never resist interior
grace."<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> "The semi-Pelagians admitted
the necessity of an interior
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">[Pg 692]</a></span>and preventing grace for all actions,
even for the beginning of faith; they
were heretics in so far as they assumed
that grace to be such that the
human will could resist it or obey
it."<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>Quesnel renewed every one of these
errors,<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> and the Synod of Pistoia
gives Quesnel's book an unreserved
approbation.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Ricci and his adherents
tell us, with Jansenius, that the
equilibrium of the human will is lost,
and that "this idea of equilibrium is
a rock against which the enemies of
grace" (that is, Catholic theologians)
"have dashed themselves." They
themselves ignore every grace from
Jesus Christ, except that which <em>creates</em>
in us a holy love, a holy delectation.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>The efficacy of grace, say they,
"does not depend on our will, but
produces it by changing us from not
willing to willing, <em>through its all-powerful
force</em>.... Far from waiting
our consent, grace creates it in us."<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>
In the synod's whole body of doctrine,
by means of which it aims to bring
back the faith to its primitive purity,
we find not a word in contradiction
of the heretical system of Jansenius;
it everywhere follows, on the contrary,
the spirit of that system, but
carefully avoids reproducing literally
any one of the famous five propositions.
But we do find in the acts of
the synod that celebrated conclusion
which concentrates in itself the poison
of the Jansenist heresy in its full
force: "There are in man two loves,
which are, as it were, the two roots
of <em>all</em> our actions&mdash;cupidity and charity;
the first is the bad tree, which
can produce only bad fruit, and the
second the good tree, which alone
produces good works. Where cupidity
dominates, charity reigns not;
and where charity dominates, cupidity
reigns not."<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> As if there were
not, remarks Pius VI., lying between
culpable love and divine charity,
which conducts us to the kingdom
of heaven, a legitimate human love!<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>When our common humanity is
thus debased and disparaged, a distance
is necessarily placed between it
and its sole mediator, Jesus Christ,
himself man also, but evidently incapable
of taking upon himself a nature
as incomplete as ours. Hence,
the disciples of Jansenius have generally
manifested an antipathy to devotions
which bring us into intimate
relations with the sacred humanity
of our Saviour. The tender and
Christian devotion to the Sacred
Heart of Jesus is especially intolerable
to them.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> As to the Blessed
Virgin Mary, her title of Mother of
God, so solemnly defined in the
Council of Ephesus against Nestorius,
hardly finds favor among them.
To the Jansenists, Mary is certainly
not the Immaculate One who crushes
the head of the infernal serpent.
They represent her the most frequently
as the Virgin depicted by
Michael Angelo, trembling and almost
hiding before the glance of
Christ the judge, on the last day.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
<em>Her greatness is terrible</em>, said the
Abbé de Saint-Cyran to Mère Angélique.
Could it be otherwise?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">[Pg 693]</a></span>
Could Jansenist fatalism give more
room for confidence than for intercession?</p>

<p>May I be permitted to add a last
word to this already long analysis?
It is said that Jansenism has had the
merit of recalling Catholics to a respect
for the sacraments.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Is this
said seriously? Luther had made
all spiritual life centre in faith; the
sacraments were thus nothing but
ceremonies proper to excite this principal
sentiment. In place of faith,
Baius and Jansenius have substituted
charity. Redeeming grace, the
divine adoption, justice, holiness, all
these they identify with love, as Luther
identified them with faith.
Now, I ask, what is it that renders
the sacraments so worthy of veneration?
Christian tradition replies
with one accord: it is their efficacy;
the sacraments are truly the causes
and the instruments of grace and
charity; they are, as it were, vases
filled with redeeming blood. But
the Jansenists do not so regard them.
According to them, the sacraments
do not confer sanctity; they suppose
it.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Before baptism, and before
penance, the adult must have <em>dominant</em>
charity in his heart; without
this, his repentance, and even his
prayers, would be but movements
of the dominant cupidity, and, consequently,
new sins. It may be
thought that I exaggerate; I subjoin,
therefore, passages from the
Synod of Pistoia, in which Quesnel
and Jansenius speak again:
"When we have unequivocal signs
that the love of God reigns in
a man's heart, we may with reason
judge him worthy of participation
with Jesus Christ in the reception of
the sacraments. This is the rule
which should be observed in the tribunal
of penance (in the question of
granting absolution). Works alone
afford a morally certain proof of conversion.
When the love of God
takes possession of the soul, it becomes
active and efficacious."<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
Again: "The first disposition for
praying as we ought is a perfect detachment
from all created things
and a kind of disgust for all earthly
consolations."<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> Until the sinner
has received this grace of the Holy
Ghost, he is unworthy of absolution
quite as much as of communion.
The words of Saint-Cyran to poor
Sister Mary Clare are well known:
"It is necessary to come, living, to
penance. This is why I have kept
you waiting so long. I have left you
to live; for five months you have been
living a spiritual life." So far no sacraments.
The practice was still worse
than the theory, as we well know.
And this is the way in which Jansenism
would recall Catholics to a respect
for the sacraments! It has, at
one blow, narrowed Christ's functions
and those of the church.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<h3>AN ENGLISH MAIDEN'S LOVE.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></h3>


<p>The third Crusade had commenced.
The cry, "God wills it,"
had gone forth from many a manly
breast, and already Frederic of Germany,
Henry II. of England, and
Philip Augustus of France had received
the cross from William, Archbishop
of Tyre. But a more powerful
monarch than Saladin, against
whom their combined strength was
to be directed, struck Frederic before
he reached Palestine, and called
Henry II., whom domestic difficulties
had detained in England. Death
gives not back that which he takes,
and, for the want of a leader, the
German army was broken up.</p>

<p>Richard, the brave Cœur de Lion,
took his royal father's place, both
on the throne and in the Crusade,
and, with Philip of France, started on
his glorious mission. Among those
brave men who gathered around
England's standard, joying to be led
by so bold a king, who, with his
lion's heart, dared every danger of
sea, land, or fierce and cruel Moslem,
was one of the oldest and
proudest of Norman blood. His
forefather, who had fought by the
side of William the Conqueror, had
distinguished himself by many a
daring deed, and had won from his
royal master, in recognition of his
bravery, an earlship over a fair and
smiling province of "merrie England";
then, renouncing his Norman
title in behalf of a younger son,
and marrying his eldest to the daughter
of a Saxon knight, he established
his right to the soil of his adopted
country. Much of his fearless nature
seemed to have come down with the
blood of Robert de Bracy, who, at
the ripe age of fifty-five, had found
himself unable to resist his monarch's
call, and to whom Cœur de Lion
himself owed much of wise counsel.
Robert de Bracy was a man of stern
aspect, but withal so compassionate
and forbearing, that he won the
love of every one who came in contact
with him. His bravery had already
been proved when, as a young
man, he fought beside Henry II, during
the war against France; and,
later, in that most dreadful invasion
of Ireland&mdash;dreadful, because of the
blow it gave to Irish independence,
and for the gradual sinking of her
people, from that time, from the
eminence in erudition and lore for
which they were renowned among
the nations, and which, be it to
their credit said, they are using
every effort to regain. A man perfectly
incapable of the least dishonorable
action, he was revered as a
knight "without stain or reproach."
A fervent Catholic, his religion was his
pride, and he never was ashamed of
kneeling in church beside the poorest
beggar, nor felt insulted because poverty's
rags touched his velvet robes.
But the good earl's heart received a
terrible blow when he heard of the
murder of Thomas à Becket. His
faith in his king was shaken, and
nothing but the stern duty of allegiance
could have induced Robert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">[Pg 695]</a></span>
de Bracy to remain in England. So
when the Crusade was preached, he
gladly seized the opportunity to
show his love for the crucified King&mdash;for
him whose throne was a cross,
and whose crown was of thorns&mdash;and
enrolled himself among the
Crusaders. He was joined by his
only son and Sir John de Vere, who,
like himself, was of Norman blood&mdash;a
brave, honest man, of strict integrity,
whose character will be better
seen in the unfolding of the story.
The earl was deeply attached to the
young knight, and the highest proof
he could give of his love was in his
willing consent that, on their return
from Palestine, Sir John should wed
his daughter, Agnes de Bracy, whose
heart was no less pure than her face
was lovely. "An' we'll make an
earl of thee, my lad!" cried the impetuous
King Richard when the
betrothal was announced to him.</p>

<p>The court of the earl's castle was
crowded with armed retainers,
knights, and esquires, who formed
the retinue of De Bracy and De
Vere. Even on and beyond the
lowered drawbridge might be seen
bands of neighing steeds, their impatience
checked ever and anon by
their riders, who awaited the earl to
head and lead them to the rendezvous
of the Crusaders. Court and
castle alike resounded with the clank
of steel and tread of armed men,
while buxom waiting-maids and merry
lads hastened to and fro in the
bustle attendant on such a departure.
Here and there stood a page
giving the finishing polish to his master's
sword, and, again, others assisted
in the girding on of the armor. Every
now and then might be heard the
wailing of some fond wife or mother,
contrasting somewhat strangely with
the jests of those who had no tie to
make the parting a sacrifice in the
good cause. Apart from all this, in
one of the inner rooms of the castle,
were gathered the earl and his family.
Lady de Bracy's loving eyes wandered
sadly from her honored husband
to the manly features of her son,
kneeling by her side, and back again
to the earl, who was soothing the
grief of his youngest child, Mary,
just old enough to know that her
father was going over land and sea,
and that she might never see him
again. In the deep embrasure of
one of the windows, partly concealed
by heavy curtains, stood Sir John
and his betrothed. Agnes had been
weeping, but being calmed by Sir
John, whose grief partook more of the
nature of joy than fear, since on his
return he was to claim her as his
bride, she rested her head quietly
against his breast, both her hands
clasped around his neck, while her
uplifted eyes sought to read every
expression of his noble face.</p>

<p>"Beloved," he said in a low tone,
"it will not be for long, please God,
though I would that thou wert
my wife e'en ere I go. And," he
added, continuing his whispered
tones, "I were no Christian knight
to doubt thy faithfulness. I'll prove
thee mine on our return from the
holy wars."</p>

<p>Agnes looked steadily at the face
so lovingly bent over her, and, unclasping
her hands, she drew from
her girdle a scarf, such as was worn
in those days, and bound it on Sir
John's sword-belt. Then, returning
her head to its resting-place, and
feeling his arm drawing her tightly to
him, as though by the very motion to
thank her, she said:</p>

<p>"An' there is thy love's guerdon;
thou shalt wear it in battle, and, when
thine eyes fall on it, remember that
<em>one</em> is praying for thee in bonnie
England."</p>

<p>Any further discourse was prevented
by the earl, who cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">[Pg 696]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sir John, we have no time to lose;
the men are ready, the steeds drawn
up, and our presence alone is needed
for immediate departure. Come,
Agnes, my daughter." And as he
placed one arm around her, with the
other he drew his wife gently to him.
Raising his eyes to heaven, he exclaimed:
"O God! protect these
dear ones while I am fighting the
good fight in thy name and for thee.
And this child," he added, as, tenderly
kissing his wife and Agnes, he loosened
his hold and took Mary in his
arms&mdash;"this child, Mother of God,
belongs to thee; keep her pure, that
thy name, borne by her, may be ever
spotless!" Then, calling the knights,
he hastily quitted the apartment, not
daring to look back. The son tore
himself from his mother's farewell
embrace, and quickly followed; but
Sir John still lingered. At last, summoning
his courage, he strained Agnes
to his breast:</p>

<p>"Farewell, my beloved! God have
thee, my own, in his keeping for so
long as it seems best to him that we
be parted."</p>

<p>As the drawbridge was raised behind
the retreating soldiers, Agnes
stood at the loophole of the main
turret, where, with her mother, she
watched till the men, horses, and
banners disappeared, shut from sight
by the declivity of a distant hill, when
she sank on her knees, and prayed
fervently for the loved ones who had
started on their perilous journey.</p>

<p>We have said that Agnes de Bracy
was lovely; that word can hardly
convey the true nature of her charms.
Personal beauty she had, and much:
dark eyes, a clear complexion, a perfect
mouth, disclosing perfect teeth,
and breaking into a smile of winning
beauty, together with a graceful form;
a character of womanly sweetness,
and great strength of will. But as
Spenser hath it:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Of the soule the bodie forme doth take;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For soule is forme, and doth the bodie make."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>It was the soul in Agnes de Bracy,
rich in God's sweet grace, which gave
her that wonderful expression; the
pure heart, "without guile," which
caused her eyes to gleam with a look
that made Sir John once exclaim,
"Methinks, Agnes, thine eyes would
soften the stony heart of the Mussulman
himself, and e'en make a Christian
of him."</p>

<p>Nor was Sir John deficient in those
qualities which would be apt to win
the admiration and love of such as
she. Like the earl, he was a most
devout Catholic. With a full, heartfelt
appreciation of his holy faith, he
could not&mdash;as many, alas! do&mdash;put it
on and off with holiday attire, but
every word and action proved how
thoroughly it was a part of himself,
and how, without it, in spite of great
natural talents, he would be&mdash;nothing.</p>

<p>To follow the Crusaders on their
journey, every step of which was
fraught with danger; to watch the
course of events as they shaped
themselves during the march of the
two armies, is not the province of
this story. About three years later,
the earl, with wounds scarcely healed
and a heavy heart, stood before the
drawbridge of his castle, which was
being rapidly lowered at the unexpected
blast of his bugle. The clanking
of the heavy armor was a joyful,
long-looked-for sound to the inmates
of the castle, who had assembled in
the court to welcome back the earl
and his followers. Weary and dust-laden,
they passed under the portal
of the gateway, a sad remnant of
their former numbers, greeting those
who stood expectant with joy or fear.
Suddenly a loud wailing arose, as
many a mother looked in vain for
the well-remembered form of her
brave lad, who died fighting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">[Pg 697]</a></span>
Saracen; and the sounds of glad rejoicing
were hushed in the presence
of the angel of sorrow. The earl and
his son made their way rapidly to the
same room that had witnessed their
farewell, and there their loved ones
awaited them. A thrill of terror
passed through Agnes' frame as she
missed the features of Sir John; and,
seeing a strange look in her father's
eyes, which were fixed so tenderly
but sorrowfully on her, she clasped
her hands tightly, and cried out:
"My God! my God! thy will, not
mine, be done; but, oh! if <em>he</em> is
dead!"</p>

<p>"Agnes, my child, my precious
child!"&mdash;and Robert de Bracy drew
his daughter to him&mdash;"God knows
my heart is heavy enough with the
story I have to tell thee, yet it is not
what thou dost expect. Sir John is
living, strong and well, but"&mdash;and
his lips quivered with emotion&mdash;"but
he is Saladin's prisoner; and I
fear me greatly that neither gold nor
silver will ransom him."</p>

<p>"Saladin's prisoner, my father?
Saladin's prisoner? And will nothing
ransom him?" And bowing her face
in her hands, she wept bitterly. But
her violent grief was not of long duration;
her nature was too thoroughly
schooled. She checked its first outburst;
and, trusting to Him who had
always given her help in her troubles,
she breathed a short, fervent prayer.
Then, raising her head, she turned to
the earl, and in her sweetest voice:</p>

<p>"Forgive me, my father," she said,
"for that I have not been thy daughter,
and, in my selfish sorrow for what
God has ordained, I have forgotten
to bid thee welcome home."</p>

<p>"Agnes! Agnes!" And the old
earl nearly broke down under the
weight of his sorrow&mdash;sorrow all the
keener for the suffering of his daughter.
"Agnes, we will not give up all
hope. I would have begged of Saladin
on my knees for <em>his</em> ransom, but
it could not have been; I was ordered
away, and no respite granted."</p>

<p>"Give up all hope? No, indeed,
my father. Far from me be such a
thought! God will help us, and my
beloved shall be ransomed if it is his
will; for he gave him to me, and he
can take him away."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lo! Damascus is rising before us;
not the Damascus of to-day, but the
quaint, beautiful Oriental city of the
XIIth century. The golden crescents
of her domed mosques flash in
the light of the Eastern sun. Her
thoroughfares are crowded with men
in their Turkish garb, and women
veiled after the manner of their nation.
Her shops are resplendent
with jewels, pearls, and jacinths;
fragrant with the perfumes of musk,
ambergris, and aloes-wood; glittering
with rustling silks and heavy
brocades, interwoven with gold, and
scarlet, and silver. Houses, beautiful
in their quaint architecture, meet
the eye at every corner, together with
palaces, the residences of emir and
vizier. But with naught of these
have we to do. Our story takes us
into the heart of the city to the palace
of Saladin, Sultan of the Turks. As
we enter, we behold banners unfurled.
Shields, helmets, every species
of armor decorate the main hall,
along whose sides are ivory benches,
where the eunuchs wait their master's
orders. A great dome is overhead,
and the sun, pouring down through
its latticed windows, floods the hall
with light, and causes the steel of the
armor and the jewels of the hall to
sparkle and flash with brilliancy. At
the further end is a heavy curtain of
brocade, richly wrought with various
kinds of embroidery in white, red, and
gold. Two tall armed men guard
the corners. We will imagine the
curtain lifted for us, and enter. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">[Pg 698]</a></span>
sits Saladin on his throne. His followers
are around him. Rich are
the robes which fall from his shoulders,
well befitting the Sultan of the
East. If the hall was gorgeous in
its beauty, the room of the throne is
no less so. The hangings on the
walls are figured with various wild
beasts and birds, worked with silk
and gold. The sandal-wood work
gives out its own peculiar perfume.
In fact, all betokens a royal presence.
And of what sort is Saladin? Great
talents in him combine for mastery;
great activity and valor. The severity
and rigor, so inflexible as to make
the bravest heart quail with fear before
him, was often replaced by such
kindness, such generosity, that the
poor, the widowed, and orphaned
did not hesitate to appeal to his
mercy. And as he sits before us, we
must draw back and continue our
story.</p>

<p>An eunuch has presented the
bowl and vase, and, having performed
the ablution, Saladin turned slowly
round, gazing steadily at the stern
faces before him. "By Allah!" he
exclaimed, as his eyes rested on the
one nearest him&mdash;"by Allah! I
trow, Moslem chiefs, you are brave,
yea, very brave and very skilful.
You have beaten back the Christians.
You have proved yourselves true
sons of Mahomet; but, for all that,
I know a braver man than you.
Eunuch! bid the Christian slave
come forth." At his sultan's orders,
the eunuch made a low bow, and
retired behind one of the hangings.
In a few moments he returned, followed
by a guard of men, and Sir John
de Vere in their centre. As they
approached with him, Saladin waved
them back, and bade the Christian
only to remain before the throne.
Then suddenly he made a sign&mdash;a
sign dreaded alike by vizier and
eunuch. It was obeyed, and a
soldier, stepping forward, waved a
sharp and gleaming scimitar over
the head of the captive; but he did
not flinch, nor move a muscle of his
face, but continued gazing with stern,
unshrinking eye straight forward.
The sultan, as if satisfied with the
courage the prisoner evinced, motioned
the soldier back. Then he
said:</p>

<p>"John de Vere, thy father's land,
thine ancient home, thou shalt see no
more; but I have great need of men
like thee. I command thee, forsake
thy Christian faith; and, if thou wilt
adore Mahomet and God, there is
no favor thou shalt ask, by my
royal word, that shall not be granted
thee. I will set thee above all men.
I alone will be above thee. I will
make thee my son. I will give thee
palaces, gold, and precious gems;
and from all the queenly maidens
thou shalt choose one and wed her
as thy bride. Thou canst not refuse
that which my caliphs strive for
years to obtain, and which to thee is
given in one day. I bid thee reply."</p>

<p>As Saladin finished, he sank back
on his throne, and a quiet smile played
around his lips as he awaited his
captive's answer. Sir John listened
to him calmly and patiently. Then
having bowed low, he raised his
head erect, and made the Christian's
mark&mdash;the sign of the cross&mdash;upon
himself.</p>

<p>"Saladin," he said, "Sultan of the
Mussulmans, since thou dost bid me
reply, I will first return thanks for all
the favors I have received at thy
hands. From the first day of my
captivity till now thou hast loaded
me with kindnesses; for these I am
grateful, though gratitude may not
seem to be in the answer I make
thee. Know, then, I, a Christian,
cannot renounce my faith. I am a
sworn soldier of my God&mdash;of him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">[Pg 699]</a></span>
who died for me. Dost thou think
that I, who bear the cross upon my
shoulder, could on that cross bring
scorn? Thou dost promise me a
Moslem wife. In that far-off land&mdash;which
God grant I may see before I
die!&mdash;I have a love, whom as my
very life I love. To her sweet heart
I will not be false. Saladin, I cannot
bear a Moslem name nor wed a
Moslem maiden."</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried the sultan, "thou
dost not know woman's heart. Perchance
she whom thou lovest so
fondly is the bride of another; nor
doubt me, that heart, fickle and
false as any woman's, which swore
such fealty to thee, belongs now perhaps
to thy rival. Never yet was
woman known to be constant. Ah!
John de Vere, thou hadst better remain
with me."</p>

<p>As he ceased, the curtain was raised,
and two by two came those holy
men vowed to ransom Christian captives
from the hands of the Turks.
They approached Saladin's throne,
and, opening their bags, they poured
out with lavish hand an untold treasure
at his feet.</p>

<p>Then the chief monk said:</p>

<p>"The bride of Sir John de Vere,
O Sultan Saladin! sends all she
hath, gold and gems, and bids thee
take them, but to restore to her her
betrothed."</p>

<p>"The other captive knights may
go with thee," replied the sultan;
"but as for all these gems and gold,
his lady-love would give them for a
dress. Sir John de Vere may not go
with thee. No wealth can ransom
him, for I love him with a more than
brother's love, and hope to win his in
return. Why, I would give a hundred
slaves, if he would renounce
his Christian faith. So thus to thy
lady this answer; for I will prove
how Christian maidens love. Tell
her that, before I yield my thrall, she
must cut off her own right arm and
hand, and send it hither to ransom
John de Vere!"</p>

<p>"Saladin," said the captive, "thy
permission for one word to say to
these monks before they go. I bid
you, brothers," he added, turning to
them, "to speak of me as dead.
For, O sweet-heart! my betrothed
bride, well do I know that not only
arm and hand, but even life itself,
thou wouldst willingly give for me;
and I cannot prove thy death, that I
may live. Do not tell her the sultan's
cruel words. O brothers! I beg
you do not!"</p>

<p>As sole reply, they gathered up
the useless treasure, and, returning to
their ships, they sailed for England.
With mournful hearts they landed on
the shore, and travelled day and
night till they reached De Bracy's
castle. There they laid down their
full bags, and told Agnes that for
neither gold nor silver could Sir John
be ransomed; but if it was still her
heart's wish that he should see his
native land again, the sultan had
promised that for one gift her betrothed
should go free.</p>

<p>"And that gift?" said Agnes.</p>

<p>"Is," replied the head monk slowly,
"thine own right arm and hand,
cut off for his sake. This is the ransom
asked. Thou canst not prevail
on Saladin to take a meaner thing."</p>

<p>Every face grew white at these
cruel words. They shuddered as
they listened to the monk; only Agnes
preserved her usual calmness.
The earl clutched his sword, and
could hardly refrain from vowing
death to every man of the Moslem
race. Little Mary cried out, clasping
her sister tightly, "Sure, Agnes, such
a wicked man cannot be found."
But quieting the child, she looked at
Lady de Bracy. The face of the
mother was marked with keen suffering.
It was a dreadful moment for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">[Pg 700]</a></span>
the brave spirit of Agnes; she knew
she must make answer, and that at
once. But how could she tell those,
who suffered so much at the very
thought of the deed, of her resolution?
"My God! it is hard; but as we love
in thee, thou must help me to do
what is right," was the prayer which
rose from her heart, as with her lips
she framed her answer.</p>

<p>"My dear ones, your daughter
need not say how much she grieves
for your sakes that she must suffer.
Cruel is the ransom asked; who could
know it better than I? But God
loves us, and did he not, because of
his love, give his own beloved Son?
And do we not see every day how
churls and nobles give their lives for
their king? 'Greater love than this
no man hath, that a man lay down
his life for his friends.' That, my father,
we know from the holy Gospels.
Wouldst thou have thy daughter
shrink duty, thou, my lord and father,
who hast bled by Cœur de Lion's
side?" She hesitated a moment,
then, her sweet voice growing clearer
and stronger, she continued:</p>

<p>"I am John de Vere's betrothed,
and to him I owe my fealty, even
though it should cost my life. My
lord and father, what is my life?
Long years spent in pleading with
God to end the banishment of my
love. And at last he has heard, at
last my prayer has been granted.
Only it must be proved that my love
is pure; so he sends me pain, and I
will take it, grateful to endure; for is
not the reward great?"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Once again the holy friars found
themselves in the beautiful city of
Damascus. Eagerly they threaded
their way through its broad but devious
thoroughfares till they reached
the palace of the sultan. Within, in
the room of the throne, sat Saladin
in royal state. By his side stood Sir
John de Vere. He still retained the
badge of slavery, for he was too true
to give up his faith; but to Saladin's
councils he was often summoned.
When any measure to be taken
against the Christians was the theme
of debate, he remained respectfully
but firmly silent. Against his brothers
he could not in conscience speak;
to do so for them he knew would
prove more than useless. But yet
many were the subjects on which his
knowledge and fine sense of justice
could be brought to bear; and Saladin
was not the man to fail in taking
advantage of his wise judgment.</p>

<p>Some such serious business had
called around the sultan his advisers,
and, as usual, Sir John stood foremost
among them. They had all but
finished the subject under consideration,
when the folds of the curtain
were lifted, and a herald entered the
royal presence.</p>

<p>"Sultan, our lord," he said, "the
monks appointed to ransom the
Christians stand without. They
crave an audience again."</p>

<p>"Let them enter," was the command
given, and swiftly obeyed.
Again the curtain was lifted upon the
holy men, and again it fell, shutting
them from the outer hall, as they
stood in the presence of Saladin.
The superior stepped forward:</p>

<p>"We thank thee, sultan, for the
favor thou hast accorded us in this
audience. But we bid thee learn, O
monarch! a lesson we bring thee&mdash;a
lesson of how great, in a nobler
faith than thine, is love's purity and
power." A dim foreboding seized
Sir John at the monk's words, and
his whole form shook with ill-suppressed
emotion, as he listened to
the conclusion:</p>

<p>"Monarch! what are women to
thee? Slaves, toys of an idle hour,
the playthings of passion. What
women of thine would do for thee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">[Pg 701]</a></span>
as Agnes de Bracy hath done for
him who stands beside thee&mdash;him
whom thou callest thy slave? Thy
cruel words have been heeded. Lo!
the answer." And he laid at Saladin's
feet a casket, richly wrought in gold
and silver. Sir John looked as one
frenzied, then seizing the casket
pressed it to his heart:</p>

<p>"Why did you tell her, O cruel
monks? Did I not ask you to speak
of me as dead? O fair arm! O
dear, sweet hand! that thou shouldst
cut it off, my beloved, and for my
poor sake!"</p>

<p>Saladin stretched out his hand to
take the casket; but Sir John only
pressed it the tighter, and sobbed
aloud. At this, the superior of the
monks, coming forward, said something
in a low voice, which caused
the young knight to lift up his face
and look at the brother. Then, turning
to the sultan, he placed the casket
reverently before him. Saladin
took it and opened it; as he raised
the lid, the perfume of aromatic
spices escaped therefrom. Lifting the
linen, he looked steadily for a moment,
then large tears were seen to
escape from his eyes and roll down
his cheeks. All the higher nature
of the man seemed to be aroused.
Calling his nobles around him, he
held the casket silently for their inspection.
Within it lay embalmed
the lily-white right arm and hand of
Agnes de Bracy. There was no
mistaking the delicate form of the
arm, the shape of the tapering fingers.
Severed from the shoulder of
that noble girl, they lay in all their
beauty, a reproach to the cruelty of
the sultan. In that throne-room not
one man but was moved to tears.
Then Saladin closed the casket, but,
still keeping a firm hold on it, he
cried out:</p>

<p>"Mahomet and God witness for
me! with a deep brother's love I
love John de Vere, and I thought I
might retain him by me if I asked
this ransom. But now I would give
my kingdom to recall those words.
Haste, John de Vere, haste to thy
noble love. O fair arm! O fair
hand! True, brave heart! Oh! that
I could claim such love as thine!
John de Vere, tell that noble woman
that Saladin yields his selfish love.
Take to her gold, gems; load the
ship with all of wealth and beauty I
have; but they would vainly prove
Saladin's grief. She who has proved
thee such a noble love will make thee
a noble wife, John de Vere. But
thou canst not take with thee this
precious casket. Among my treasures
I shall store it away. It will
prove to future ages how Christian
maidens keep their troth, and how
pure is their love."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>More than this the legend tells
us not. But it is said that in a
church in England may still be seen
a statue of the knight and his noble,
one-armed lady.</p>

<h3>OUR MASTERS.</h3>


<p>Freedom is the boast of half the
civilized world, and the envy of the
other half. It is the embodiment of
the desires of our age, the goal of
the individual, as well as the collective
life of nations. It is a treasure
jealously guarded or a prize passionately
longed for, the pretext for riot
and disorder, the burden of diplomatic
messages, the ostensible object of
all civic government. England records
in the words of a national song,
"Britons never will be slaves," her
proud determination to grasp it;
America asserts elasticity of personal
liberty as the chief attraction
of her territory; everywhere the cry
is, "We will do as we like, and accept
no dictation from any man." It is
a somewhat strange commentary on
this fierce vindication of one man's
rights that they invariably clash with
the rights of all other men, provided
the latter happen to differ in the interpretation
of freedom. Again, it
is a curious psychological phenomenon
that this much-vaunted freedom
generally ends in a frantic appeal to
the state to force one particular set
of principles upon a large majority
to whom these principles are repulsive.
In some countries "freedom" means
expulsion from a quiet retreat deliberately
chosen years ago by men and
women in full possession of their
senses: witness the depopulated monasteries
and the poor religious
thrust out to starve or beg. In
others it means the minute supervision
of state officials over the educational
and religious interest of thousands&mdash;a
sort of domestic inquisition
in perpetual session on moral subjects,
which the individual inquisitors
do not pretend even to have studied.
In conjunction with this species of
freedom we have the ravenous appetite
for unbelief of all shades, for laxity
of morals, for the elasticity of the
marriage-tie, for a pleasant and dignified
way of losing our souls, for
decorous but unrestrained indulgence
of our passions&mdash;in short, for the manifold
attractions of the "broad road."
This is the serious side of the question&mdash;the
one to be dwelt upon by
preachers and philosophers, and
that which the heedless actors in the
world's drama are apt to pass by as
a matter of course&mdash;a thing taken for
granted long ago.</p>

<p>But there is another aspect, more
personal and more intimate, in which
this question appears to us. We
boast of being free, and at every
turn the commonest circumstances
of our daily life belie us. Free!
why, we are tied as fast as we can be
to a perpetual pillory; like the prisoner
of Chillon, we can just walk
round and round our post at the
length of our chain, and wear a
groove into the hard stone of our
surroundings. Free! with a hundred
masters: the gout, dyspepsia, the doctor,
the cook, society, the weather.
Free! with the newspaper to dictate
our ideas and opinions, to choose,
recommend, and puff our candidates,
to lay down the law in criminal
cases, to patronize the jury and pass
sentence on the prisoner!</p>

<p>It would be hard to find a condition
in life which is not eminently a
bondage, and a bondage the more
galling because the bonds are so in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_703" id="Page_703">[Pg 703]</a></span>significant.
It is almost equally hard
to know where to begin the record
of our abject submission to external
trammels. You are tired, and want
to sleep an extra hour in the morning.
Of course, you think you have
only to will this, and it is done.
But you are not allowed to sleep;
the noise in the street increases; the
bells of the cars mingle in determined
clangor with the whistle of the
steamboat; an organ-grinder takes
up his position under your window,
and serenades you into madness;
the "horn of the fish-man is heard
on the hill" (Murray Hill); presently
the fire-alarm sounds, and the clatter
of engines follows close upon it;
while all the time the flies are industriously
reconnoitring your face,
walking over your eyelids, losing
themselves in your hair, and, despite
your half-unconscious protest, you
must own after all that you are
awake.</p>

<p>Then the whole tenor of your mind
for the day may depend upon the
exact degree of tenderness in the
customary beefsteak or on the extra
turn given to the crisp buckwheat.
So the wire-pulling is done in the
kitchen, and your vaunted independence
as a man and a citizen goes
down ignominiously before the fiat
of the cook. This kind of thing is
interminable. You are at the mercy
of your tradesmen, and, for the
sake of peace, you pay the bills
and submit to be cheated with
inferior provisions while paying the
price of superior ones. The newspaper
is not always ready to your
hand when you feel inclined to look
at the news of the world, and straightway
your mind becomes uneasy,
your temper rises, and you have
again surrendered your freedom.
You order your horse, but find he is
lame, and so you must forego your
plans for the day; you make up
your mind to start by the early train
to-morrow, and enjoy a day in the
country, and find, when you open
your window in the morning, that
the rain is pouring with dismal
steadiness, and promises to do so for
many hours to come. Sometimes
your wife keeps you waiting fifteen
minutes for dinner, and, on sitting
down, you find the soup cold and
the <em>entrées</em> spoiled; and it is well
known that not even Job could have
stood that! The wind and tide wait
for no man; and so you are hurried
out of bed against your will at unseasonable
hours of the night or
morning, and packed on board the
steamer bound for Europe while yet
half asleep and as sulky as a bear,
your free-will practically gone as
much as if you were a bale of goods
being shipped and checked for Liverpool.</p>

<p>Social customs are no less a hidden
tyranny. If you would not appear
eccentric, you must do as others
do&mdash;wear a dress-coat when you would
fain be in your shirt-sleeves, and
a smile when you are dying for an
opportunity to yawn. If you are a
silent man, you must nevertheless
join in the gossip of your fellow-guests,
and laugh at unmeaning jokes,
for fear people should call you a
misanthrope, and avoid you as a
"wet blanket" to conversation. If
you have any decided opinion, you
must keep it to yourself, and avoid
the vacant stare of astonished good-breeding
which is the penalty of any
energetic statement. It is vulgar to
be too demonstrative or to have any
settled opinions; enthusiasm is out
of fashion, and indifference has at
least the advantage of never committing
you to anything. If a little
deviation in manner from the recognized
standard is not reprehensible,
then it is voted amusing, and the
self-asserting individual is considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704">[Pg 704]</a></span>
a good butt; but no one dreams of
asking his advice or even crediting
him with common sense. All his
real qualities are lost sight of, and he
is judged by the mere accident of
"originality." No one takes the trouble
further to investigate his character;
he is "odd," and people either
drop him as a bore, or run after him as
a lion.</p>

<p>If a man has a hundred invisible
masters, a woman has five hundred.
From the cook to the dressmaker,
from the nurse to the baby, she is
surrounded by tyrants. She is at the
mercy of the <em>coiffeur</em>, who comes in an
hour behind time, and tumbles her
hair into shape in a violent hurry,
so that she is late at the ball; she
lives with the sword of Damocles
above her head in the shape of the
dressmaker, who <em>will</em> send in a ball-dress
so loosely sewn together that it
splits in many places before the evening
is over; if she is poor, she is the
slave of desire, perpetually tantalized
by the splendors she cannot reach,
eating her heart out because Mrs.
Jones has got a new bonnet so far
finer than her own, or Mrs. Smith's
rich uncle gave her a cashmere shawl
impossible to outrival; if she is married,
the regulating of the domestic
atmosphere will cost her many an anxious
thought, a curtailed hour of leisure,
an uneasiness regarding a possible
storm when Harry comes home and
finds his new hat mangled by the pet
puppy; if she is single, she will be always
scheming for an escort, and fretting
lest she should be overlooked, and
so on through every variety of possible
female situations. To this picture
there is a companion. See the unhappy
bachelor of moderate means, in a
forlorn boarding-house, pining for the
simplest luxuries or the innocent
liberty of stretching at full length on
a lounge without taking off his working-clothes;
sighing for a variety in
the round of his monotonous meals,
and for the possibility&mdash;without hazard
of starvation&mdash;of an occasional
morning snooze when the inexorable
breakfast-bell calls him to the renewed
treadmill of existence. But woe
to the man who rashly turns to
matrimony, and surrenders, without
mature deliberation and cogent reasons,
the liberty&mdash;such as it is&mdash;which
still remains to him. His change
may be from the "frying-pan into the
fire," and the nightly fate of the
wretched Caudle, of curtain-lecture
memory, may claim him for life. Is
the rash Benedict "free," when the
irreproachable wife begins to make
her hand felt, and, together with the
immaculate table-linen, the punctual
and succulent meals, the orderly
household, the never-failing newspaper
always at hand at the right
moment, yet silently conveys to
him the awful impression that she is
heaping coals of fire on his head?
A man may be in prison, and, if he
can pay for them, may yet enjoy
every luxury and attention; still, it
would be rather stretching the point
to say that he was therefore free.
So both sexes know how to tighten
invisible bonds around each other's
claims, and "freedom" is practically
as meaningless as the apparent life
of a still green tree  woven round
by the graceful and fatal vine.</p>

<p>The majority of mankind are quite
debarred from any tangible freedom
by the lack of means with which to
procure it. A poor man cannot,
physically speaking, be a free agent;
but, in compensation, the richer and
higher placed a man is, the more
social and moral trammels will he
encounter. Excess of want and excess
of possession often end by producing
the same result. The poor man cannot
move from his post, because he has
not the money to do so; the rich man
cannot move from it, because he has too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705">[Pg 705]</a></span>
much money to watch over. Wealth,
too, brings its responsibilities; and
a conscientious man, in whose hands
lie the life and comfort of hundreds
of his fellow-creatures, cannot leave
his post because his tenants or operatives
would suffer through his absence.
In fact, no one, in a certain
sense, can be "free," except an unprincipled
man and an unbeliever.
Selfishness is the only road to such
animal freedom as would content a
sensualist. A Christian, be he poor
or rich, cannot aspire to this worldly
freedom, because his religion tells
him that he is <em>not</em> free to desert those
with whom God has linked his fortunes.
Family circumstances fetter
one to an incredible degree; conscience
is a perpetual trammel; and
even the exigencies of position are
sometimes a legitimate restraint on
our actions. Many persons of narrow
minds, not particularly influenced by
moral forces, fall a prey to Mrs.
Grundy, and dare not face the opinion
and comments of their neighbors.
In the most trivial things we are
slaves to the verdict of society. Who
would not rather have danger than
ridicule? How many things, whether
lawful or unlawful, are we not
ashamed to do, because of what "people
would say," quite irrespective of
the intrinsic right or wrong, expediency
or uselessness, of the thing itself?
It may well be said that it is less a sin
in the eyes of the world to break every
one of the Ten Commandments than
to enter a room with your hat on, or
ask a girl to marry you on nothing a
year. It would require more pluck
to stand up for an unfashionable
religion, or defend an unpopular person
in a cultivated assemblage arrayed
on the opposite side of the question,
than it would to storm a citadel
or rescue a sinking ship. To contravene
one-quarter of an article of the
impalpable code of society entails
downright ostracism; and the lynch-law
administered to social delinquents
effectually keeps people in
this imaginary groove, where the
invisible penalties of religious codes
are unavailing to enforce good
morals. How hollow the system is
which thus intrenches itself behind
such paltry defences we need not say;
but how infinitely more galling and
more belittling is this servitude than
the yoke of God which men fly from!
Absolute hardships, real privations,
men will cheerfully undergo, provided
it is with a worldly object; nobody
minds being a slave when the
devil is master and the livery is cloth-of-gold.</p>

<p>One of the axioms of the day is
that marriage should be a profitable
speculation. To what lengths do
not men and women proceed in
order to fulfil this inculcation to the
letter? The writer once heard the
hunt after wealthy marriages likened
to the vicissitudes of S. Paul on his
journeys. The likeness was forcible,
though hardly elegant; but, at any
rate, it was earnestly and not irreverently
meant. The best of it was that
it was so startlingly true, and that
no part of the world, no system
of society, could escape the allusion.
Perils by sea and land, perils by robbers,
perils by false brethren, watchings
and hunger, cold and nakedness&mdash;there
was not one detail which did
not find its counterpart in the modern
race after matrimonial advantages.
People undergo for the world more
hard penances than would suffice to
bridge over purgatory, did they suffer
them for God. Wolsey, in his disgrace,
cried out that if he had served his
God but half so well as he had served
his king, he would not now be reaping
a meed of contempt and ingratitude.
So with the world; it despises
those who toil for it, and no one is
less respected by it than the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">[Pg 706]</a></span>
man who has sacrificed principle to
win its life-homage. As to the marriage
lottery, there is very little that
is not staked for a lucky throw of
the dice. Health is ruthlessly sacrificed;
delicate girls brave the night
air, the draughts in the corridor, the
sudden change from a fetid heat to
intense cold, the unwholesome meal
at abnormal hours, the loss of actual
rest, all for the questionable pleasure
of attending a ball every night in the
week, and being seen "everywhere."
Economy is disregarded, and reckless
outlay on flimsy, temporary dress indulged
in without a murmur; delicacy
and modesty are tacitly put by
as unfit considerations in the present,
however useful they may prove in the
future; underhand inquiries as to a
young man's habits and associates,
his fortune and his prospects, are unblushingly
made, quite as a matter of
business; snares and pitfalls are judiciously
contrived for the coroneted
or gilded victim; pride of birth, of
which, at any other time, the practised
diplomatists of the <i lang="fr">salons</i> are so tenacious,
is pocketed at the approach
of some plebeian prize, and the son
or daughter of a self-made man is
welcomed with admirably simulated
rapture when duly weighted with
the parent's hardly-earned money.
Stranger than all, this mania of
gambling in marriage&mdash;for it is nothing
less&mdash;seizes even persons whom
you would naturally suppose would,
by instinct or principle, be averse to
any such transactions; but though
you will find them proof against
every other meanness, the very shadow
of this one will unsettle their
minds. Good people seem impelled
to join this race as by an irresistible
fatality, and will actually blind themselves
to the repulsiveness of such a
course by glossing it over as an outgrowth
of a sacred instinct, parental
love, and solicitude. Needy and idle
men, seeking a fortune by marriage
with an heiress, are not a whit better&mdash;nay,
a shade more despicable&mdash;than
mercenary women on the same lookout.</p>

<p>But it must be confessed that
there is a healthier and nobler side
to human nature which is too often
obscured by the supposed requirements
of our worst tyrant&mdash;society.
There are women who, being rich
and high-minded, view this pursuit
of themselves with disgust; and there
are men, equally high-minded, but
poor, who love these women, but, for
fear of being classed with interested
suitors, and sometimes for fear of a
contemptuous refusal, never come
forward and acknowledge their love.
The woman who sees this may love
such a man, but maidenly dignity
forbids her making it too plain; and
"society" thus manages to make
two honest hearts wretched for years,
sometimes for life, and perhaps in the
end to efface in them even the belief
in true and disinterested affection.
And we dare to call ourselves "free"!</p>

<p>Business and our material interests
are so many burdens and trammels
to our liberty. Say that we are
easy-going and indolent, fond of
sedentary pleasures; but a long and
uncomfortable journey becomes necessary,
and, under the penalty of material
losses, we are obliged to choose
the lesser of the two evils. Or reverses
swoop down so suddenly upon
us that, having been used to elegant
leisure and comparative security, we
are incontinently thrown on our own
resources, and obliged to work, if we
would not starve. Even the choice
of work is not always open to us, or we
may happen to choose some unremunerative
work, which fate and our hard-hearted
neighbor will persist in
making useless to us. Even with
prosperity work itself becomes a tyrant;
and when the lucky worker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707">[Pg 707]</a></span>
thinks of enjoying his earnings in
peace and retirement, the restless demon
of habit steps in to make his very
retirement wretched. He is allowed
no peace, but sighs for the counting-house
or the workshop; and one has
heard of such haunted men going
about disconsolately beneath the
weight of fortune, until solaced by
a miniature feint of the old work&mdash;a
place where, far from the satin,
gilding, and ormolu of the fashionable
mansion, they can plane and
turn common chairs and tables, or sit
in a leathern apron, cobbling their
own boots. Poor millionaire! are you
"free"?</p>

<p>Other men are slaves not so much
to their passions as their tastes. Such
an one undergoes tortures if another's
collection of china is better than his
own, or if a rival bids higher than he
can afford to do for an old Italian or
Flemish picture. This man would
give himself more trouble to secure
an old carved <em>secrétaire</em> of English
oak or Indian ebony than he would
to promote some work of charity;
another has a hobby about sumptuous
bindings, or rare lace, or any <em>bric-a-brac</em>
of the kind; inartistic furniture
is an eyesore to him, inharmonious
colors upset his equanimity,
and everywhere, even in church,
any defect of form irritates and repulses
him. He is hardly master of
his own thoughts, and is apt to form
hidden prejudices; he lives in the
clouds, and often makes himself disagreeable
to those who do not.</p>

<p>The tyrannous custom of making
funerals and weddings an occasion
of useless pomp is perhaps one of the
most reprehensible of all. The fashion
has insensibly grown till one's perverted
sense of what is "fitting" has
almost acknowledged it to be a necessity.
So the mourners are disturbed,
their privacy broken in upon,
delicacy outraged in every possible
way, the curiosity of strangers gratified,
an unseemly hubbub substituted
for the solemn stillness natural
to the presence of death&mdash;all in order
that the world's fiat may be duly
obeyed. People pretend that all this
fuss is to honor the memory of the
dead. No such thing; it is to feed
the vanity of the living. It must
not be said that Mr. S&mdash;- did not
provide as good a table, as handsome
any array of carriages, as great a profusion
of flowers, as richly ornamented
a coffin, for his wife's funeral, as
did Mr. R&mdash;&mdash; last year on a similar
"melancholy occasion," any more
than in the lifetime of the two ladies
could it have been suffered to
have gone abroad that Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash;'s
rooms were not as uncomfortably
crowded for a reception as Mrs.
R&mdash;&mdash;'s, or her carriage not of the
same irreproachable build.</p>

<p>The world has undertaken to decide
for us, in the privacy of home as
well as beyond its walls, exactly the
degree of outward respect to be
shown to the dead. Such and such
a particular texture, and crape of
such and such a particular width, is
the measure of the widow's, the
daughter's, or the sister's grief; less
would be indecorous, more would be
eccentric! The milliner tells us in a
subdued voice how much jet is allowable,
and how soon the world expects
the appearance of a white collar in
place of a black one, just as the
world dictates the exact length of a
court-train, and mentions the appropriate
number of feathers to be worn
in the hair. In England, a widow's
cap is <i lang="fr">de rigueur</i>, and not to wear it
would be to brand one's self with the
mark of a flirt and a questionable
character. In other countries in
Europe, it is not in use, and the
character of French and Italian widows
is not dependent on an extra
frill of white crape. How a poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_708" id="Page_708">[Pg 708]</a></span>
and proud woman, unwilling to be
behind her neighbors in respect of
decorous mourning-robes, can manage
the enormous expense of a thing
so perishable and so dear as crape,
in such quantities as to entirely cover
a dress, is a mystery which the peremptory
laws of society do not care
to enter into and do not pretend to
solve.</p>

<p>Weddings are hardly, under the
iron hand of custom, what one might
reasonably expect them to be&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>,
family festivities. They are not occasions
of personal rejoicing over the
happiness of your nearest and dearest&mdash;oh!
no, that is humdrum and
"slow"; so the wedding-day is turned
into a gorgeous manifestation of
your worldly wealth&mdash;a day of hollow
ostentation and often of hidden sadness.
The extravagance of your
floral decorations, and the judicious
display of the bride's presents, cost you
more thought than the solemn covenant
about to be made; the adjustment
of the pearl necklace, the
graceful folds of the bridal veil, the
perfect fit of the white kid glove, are
of far more importance than the vow
pronounced so lightly at the altar.
It is the reception, not the sacrament,
that predominates in most
minds. Instead of a family gathering,
reverently waiting in prayer for
the happy consummation of a very
solemn and awful contract, you have
a mob of slight and careless acquaintances,
down to the very scourings of
your visiting-list, assembled to stare
and gape at the show, to talk slang
and make unseemly jokes, to criticise
your hospitality, and make bets as to
how soon the marriage may be followed
by a separation. Everybody
asks how much money has the bride,
what is the standing of the bridegroom,
what are the settlements, etc.
When they go away, they do not
even thank you for the lavish expense,
whose fruits they, and they alone,
have enjoyed; but, instead of that,
they abuse your champagne and rebuke
your extravagance. Privacy&mdash;a
necessary condition of domestic
happiness&mdash;is impossible on this great
day; prayer is almost out of the question;
reflection is scared away. It
might be hoped that the young couple
would now be allowed to retire into
private life, after this free exhibition
of themselves as the central figures
of a puppet-show. But, no; fashion
pronounces otherwise. A wedding-trip,
though not deemed quite indispensable
by the code of society, is still
favorably looked upon, and, if possible,
is a still worse thing than the
wedding itself. Dissipation is the
order of the day; the change of
toilets becomes the all-absorbing
topic of the bride's thoughts and conversation;
the tour must include the
showiest watering-places; perpetual
motion and a full meed of frivolity
are ensured, a kaleidoscope of discreet
admirers provided, little mild
triumphs of flirtation enjoyed, with
the added zest of perfect security
from embarrassing proposals, and
equal immunity from the new-made
husband's wrath, since he could not
thus early begin to lay down the law;
and a most miserable foundation is
laid for the after-comfort of home.
Besides, what does a wedding-trip
imply? That life is a drudgery, and
a respite is necessary before taking
up the burden. The home is thus
made a vision of imprisonment&mdash;scarcely
a wise preparation. Then
the foolish and utterly useless expenditure
probably cripples the
young couple, in ordinary cases, for
some time to come. The month's
trip has swallowed what would have
covered half the year's expenses, and
"going home," instead of holding
out a bright prospect, is connected
with dulness, retrenchment, and mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">[Pg 709]</a></span>notony.
This is what society and its
tyranny have succeeded in making
of marriage. Are such couples "free"
agents?</p>

<p>Who <em>is</em> free on this earth? Who
is not the slave of petty caprices,
even if he escapes the worse servitude
of degrading vices? The drunkard,
the sensualist, the gambler, are victims
of low passions that destroy
health and sap vitality, while they
surely lead to a lonely or a violent
end; but with such aberrations we
do not propose to deal. But even
those who pride themselves on their
freedom from any vice or bad habit,
what are they, often, but puppets
swayed by absurd influences radiating
from such sources as the loss of
a night's rest, the delay of a meal,
the failure to reach a certain train?</p>

<p>Children and pets are well-known
tyrants, not only to the mother or
the maiden aunt, but to the male
creation in general and the old generation
in particular. The grandfather
is ready at all times to be made
a hobby-horse, the grandmother to
drudge for king baby. The children's
dinner is the event of the day; Harry's
destructiveness of his first pair
and all following pairs of trousers is
the burden of the household lament;
little Cissy's first tooth is a matter of
deep interest; baby Maggie is allowed
to pull mother's hair down just before
dinner, unrebuked&mdash;nay, even encouraged.
Pet poodles and favorite parrots,
and, indeed, all tame companions
of mankind, absorb a wonderful
amount of human interest and attention,
and often demand it at unseasonable
hours; compelling idleness,
or at least encouraging loss of time.
In fact, our time and mind are ever
occupied with supplementary things,
forced upon us by custom or caprice;
and we secretly but helplessly
rebel, incapable, we think, of either
resistance to our own follies, or
courage to laugh in the face of Mrs.
Grundy.</p>

<p>It is impossible to stand absolutely
free in the world, but there is freedom
and freedom. Of all freedoms,
that of the free-thinker is the narrowest.
Uncertainty is a grievous spirit,
doubt a bad master; and the poor
free-thinker finds that his mental
companion and philosophic guide offers
him but slight comfort under misfortune.
Moral restraints are to him
but chaff in the wind, religious forms
mere dust shaken off his shoes; but
what remains? He deems himself
king of the world of thought, but
he finds his kingdom turned into a
desert; he acknowledges no ties or
duties, undertakes no responsibility,
works (if he works) for himself alone,
and then finds that what he earns he
cannot enjoy unshared. Temporary
human companionship on earth has
no charms for him; for he reflects
that annihilation follows death, and
it is therefore useless to make bosom
friends of men who will so soon be
less than nothing, and whose only
memento will be in the richness of
the crops grown over their graves.
The mental solitude of the free-thinker
is not an agreeable or a soothing
one; much less is it fruitful in high
thoughts or heroic actions.</p>

<p>If any ask in an earnest spirit,
where are the fewest masters, and
where freest men?&mdash;we would answer,
in the cloister.</p>

<p>A startling answer to the worldling;
a suggestive one to the thinker.
Let us examine it, and see whether
it can be substantiated. Religious
are the men supposed to be the
most subjected to authority in the
world&mdash;those whose duty it is to have
not only no will of their own, but
even no individual thought, no opinion
of any kind. Even so, in a
sense; and on that account, not despite
it, <em>but because of it</em>, are they the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">[Pg 710]</a></span>
freest men on earth. The secular
clergy are comparatively free, because
they have one object only; that is, one
Master. Priests are not burdened
with family and household cares,
scarcely with social necessities; but
none the less are they sometimes
vexed by circumstances which they
cannot control, and are made to pay
the tithe of that slavery which any
contact with the world, even for the
world's good, and by men who are
not of the world, necessarily entails.
Religious even of active orders are
still freer, because they are less of the
world; but the man who stands before
God in silent contemplation, as
the eagle pauses before the sun and
looks into its depths, is the freest of all.
A purely contemplative order, whose
mission, higher yet than that of the
captains of Israel, is that of Moses
praying with uplifted arms for the
triumph of the people of God&mdash;such
is the home of the highest and truest
freedom.</p>

<p>The ascetic has found the secret
that philosophers seek for in vain,
that attitude of godlike calm in the
midst of all transient storms of life.
The supremest exercise of freedom is
to surrender that freedom itself, with
full confidence that the person into
whose hands it is surrendered is the
representative of a higher power. A
king would not be free were he prevented
from abdicating his kingship;
the religious vow is the abdication of
a kingdom greater than is constituted
by so many thousands of square
miles. This renunciation once made,
no earthly event can be of the slightest
interest to the disenthralled man.
No care for his body, no solicitude
for his reputation, remains; he has
disrobed himself of his earthly belongings,
and let slip every vestige
of the garments of worldliness. A
spirit&mdash;practically almost disembodied&mdash;he
looks above for inspiration,
comfort, guidance, knowledge. The
miseries of earth, if poured into his
ear by some despairing fellow-mortal,
gain from him the divine pity of an
angel rather than the passionate
sympathy of a man; he is raised
above the wants of nature, the wrangles
of society, even the perplexities
of the intellect. Taught no longer
by men or by books, he speaks face
to face with God in his long prayers
and meditations, and no human interest
ever distracts his mind from
this exalted colloquy. Insensible to
the influences of time, place, and
circumstance, he is still as free as air
when hunted from his retreat by men
to whom his whole life is an enigma;
the oracle speaks to him in the
midst of a crowd, and he no more
hears the murmur of those around
him than if he were at sea, a thousand
miles from land; a palace, a prison,
or a scaffold are all reproductions of
his cell, for the same all-filling Presence
surrounds him, blinding him
to all else. His indifference is
so galling to his enemies, his freedom
so mysterious and so provoking, that
they would rather put him to death
than witness the unutterable calm
they can neither disturb nor emulate;
but that death is only the one more
step needed for his perfect bliss&mdash;the
one veil to be yet lifted between the
ascetic philosopher and the freedom
that taught him his philosophy.</p>

<p>Serene land of passionless perfection,
which men call the monastic
life! How many, even among religious,
scale thy furthermost heights?
Yet it is a consolation to mankind to
know that there <em>is</em>, even on earth, a
sanctuary where human nature, be it
only represented by ever so few, can
reach to that ideal state of perfect
communion with God and perfect
contempt of all trammels which
alone should be dignified with the
name of philosophy.</p>

<h3>A LOOKER-BACK.</h3>

<div class="center">

</div>


<p>There are some people in the
world who, like the sad mourners
that come up through Dante's hollow
vale with heads reversed, have not
the power to see before them. Their
eyes are always peering into the
past, they go groping in the dim twilight
of bygone days; they wander
off the highway of ordinary life, till
they lose their place in its sphere;
they have no knowledge but legendary
lore, no wisdom but that of past
generations. And when, by some
accident, they cross the current of
the present age, they grasp at the
very first relic of the past as a link
with the receding shore.</p>

<p>It was such a one that found himself
adrift on the high tide at Charing
Cross&mdash;which Dr. Johnson so
loved; and, amazed and confused by
the incessant, tumultuous flow of a
life in which he had no part, took refuge
in the thousand sanctuaries of
the past to be found in London.
Belonging by a peculiar grace, as one
born out of due time, to the ancient
church&mdash;for ever ancient, for ever
new!&mdash;he turned particularly to
those old Catholic foundations around
which cluster so many associations, at
once religious, historical, and poetic.
Having read of them from childhood,
and learned to connect them with
the past glory of the church, and
familiar with all the romantic and
legendary lore concerning them,
when he found himself in their midst
his heart and soul and imagination
were at once aflame. It was then
to such places as Westminster Abbey,
Christ's Hospital, the Charter-House,
and the Temple that his
heart instinctively turned on his arrival
in London.</p>

<p>Not that he actually visited them
first. The Divine Presence, alas!
no longer dwells in them incarnate;
and it was of course, as became one
with pilgrim-staff and scallop-shell,
to the foot of the Tabernacle he hastened,
the first time he issued from
his lodgings, to offer up his prayer of
thanksgiving to <em>Jésus-Hostie</em> for a
safe voyage across the Atlantic. But
at his very threshold he could see a
spot associated with many terrible
memories, marked by a stone: "Here
stood Tyburn Gate." Here the
last prior of the Charter-House was
executed, and Robert Southwell, the
Jesuit poet of Queen Elizabeth's
time, whose last words were expressive
of his attachment to the Society
of Jesus and his happiness to suffer
martyrdom. Many others, too, of
religious and historic memory, ascended
here from earth to heaven. Close
beside the spot is the Marble Arch
of Hyde Park. "Beyond Hyde
Park all is a desert!" said our pilgrim
with Sir Fopling Flutter, glad to be
diverted from memories too sad for
one's first impressions of a foreign
city. Two serene-looking "Little
Sisters of the Poor," providentially
crossing the path, directed him to the
French chapel&mdash;a modest sanctuary,
but where such men as Lacordaire,
De Ravignan, and other distinguished
French pulpit-orators have been
heard. The way thither was through
Portman Square, once the property
of the Knights of S. John of Jerusalem.
Here the celebrated Mrs. Montague
once lived. In one corner of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_712" id="Page_712">[Pg 712]</a></span>
the square stands apart&mdash;in a large
yard, a square old-fashioned brick
house with an immense portico in
front, and a two-story bow window
at the end&mdash;one of those houses that
we at once feel have a history. This
is Montague House, where Mrs.
Montague used to give an annual
dinner to the London chimney-sweeps,
"that they might enjoy one happy
day in the year"&mdash;a house frequented
by the literary celebrities of the
time&mdash;where Miss Burney was welcomed,
and Ursa Major grew tame.</p>

<p>A short distance from the French
chapel is the Spanish church, dedicated
to S. James, with its S. Mary's
aisle lighted from above, giving a fine
<em>chiaro-oscuro</em> effect to the edifice. It
was pleasant to find an altar to the
glorious Patron of Spain in a city
where he was once so venerated, and
whose name has been given to one
of its social extremes. The devotion
of the English to S. Jago di Compostella
was extraordinary in the Middle
Ages. So general was it, that the Constable
of the Tower, in the time of Edward
II., used to receive a custom of
two-pence from each pilgrim to Spain
going or returning by the Thames.
Rymer mentions 916 licenses to visitors
to that shrine in the year 1428,
and 2,460 in 1434. And here, in this
modern English church, is a statue
of the saint, with the scallop-shell on
his cape, first assumed by pilgrims to
Compostella as a token that they had
extended their penitential wanderings
to that sainted shore. English Catholics
of the olden time seemed to have
had a special love for pilgrimages,
and we hail a renewed taste for such
a devotion as a revival of the spirit
of the past.</p>

<p>It was the good fortune of our
modern pilgrim to hear the Archbishop
of Westminster preach a few
days after in the Spanish church on
the state of the soul after death&mdash;a
preacher that harmonizes at once
with the past and the present&mdash;full
of sympathy with the present, full
of the spirit of the past. A S. Jerome
from his cave, a S. Anthony
from the desert! is the first thought,
and his wonderfully solemn style of
preaching is in harmony with his ascetic
appearance. Nothing could be
more impressive and affecting. Neither
did our wanderer forget the ivy-clad
oratory at Kensington, still perfumed
with holy memories of F.
Faber. He felt the need of thanking
him here for the thousand precious
words he had spoken to his soul
through his beautiful hymns and invaluable
works on the inner life;
soothing it in sorrow, and arming it
against the transitory evils of life.
Such evils follow every one, even the
pilgrim, and it was good to repeat
here Faber's lines:</p>

<span class="i2">To all, my God, but thee!"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>What a round of sweet devotions in
this church, with the taper-lighted
oratory of Mary Most Pure! Oh!
how near to heaven one gets there!&mdash;the
beautiful shrine-like chapel of
S. Philip Neri, and the solemn Calvary
where, between the two thieves,
the Divine Image is outstretched
on the huge cross, embalming the
wood&mdash;</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>Many pious hearts seem drawn
here to meditate on the Passion, and,
one after another, go up to kiss the
blood-stained cross. Oh! how many
ways the church has of leading the
soul to God! Guido declared he had
two hundred ways of making the eyes
look up to heaven. The church has
many more with its multiplied popular
devotions, each peculiarly adapted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_713" id="Page_713">[Pg 713]</a></span>
to some cast of soul. It would be
heaven enough below to have a cell
somewhere near this sweet school of
S. Philip's sons and the beautiful altars
they have set up.</p>

<p>While thus gratifying the devotional
instincts of his heart, some religious
monument of bygone ages
was constantly falling in our pilgrim's
way. How could he pass S. Pancras-in-the-Fields
without falling into
prayer, as Windham in his diary tells
us Dr. Johnson did, recalling the
Catholic martyrs burnt here at the
stake in Queen Elizabeth's time?
The bell of S. Pancras&mdash;O funeral
note of woe!&mdash;was the last to ring for
Mass in England at the time of the
so-called Reformation. A wonder
it did not break in twain as it sounded
that last elevation of the Host!
Has it ever uttered one joyful note
since that sad morn, when the altars
were stripped, the lights one by one
put sorrowfully out, and the Divine
Presence faded away? No, no; it
has the saddest tone of any bell in
London, at least to the Catholic ear.
As it was here he was laid away, it
is no wonder that faithful Catholics,
down to the present century, were in
the habit of coming to S. Pancras at
early morning hour to seek some
trace of their buried Lord. Perhaps
he sometimes appeared to such devout
souls, as of old to his Mother
and Magdalen. It is certain that, at
least, he spoke to their hearts as they
lingered here to pray&mdash;pray that he
might rise again! And here they
wished to rest after death, till they
were again allowed to have a cemetery
apart. This was the burial-place
of the Howards and Cliffords,
and others of high lineage, both foreign
and native. One old friend lies
here, John Walker&mdash;well known from
his <cite>Dictionary</cite>, once extensively used
in America, a convert to the Catholic
Church, and a friend of Dr. Milner's,
who calls him "the Guido
d'Arezzo of elocution, who discovered
the scale of speaking sounds by
which reading and delivery have
been reduced to a system."</p>

<p>S. Pancras was once a popular
saint. The boy-martyr of Rome,
whose blood was shed in the cause
of truth, was regarded in the middle
ages as the avenger of false oaths.
The kings of France used to confirm
treaties in his name. The English,
with their natural abhorrence of lying,
so honored him as to give his
name to one of the oldest churches
in London. Cardinal Wiseman has
popularized his memory in these days
through <cite>Fabiola</cite>.</p>

<p>Again, what a flood of recollections
comes over the pilgrim in passing
through Temple Bar, or going
across London Bridge, first built by
the pious brothers of S. Mary's Monastery
in 994. The old bishops
and monks were truly the <em>pontifices</em>
of the middle ages&mdash;not only as
builders of</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"The invisible bridge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That leads from earth to heaven,"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>but good substantial arches of stone
over stream and flood. The Pont
Royal over the Seine was built by a
Dominican. So was the Carraja at
Florence. The old bridges of Spain
were mostly due to the clergy.</p>

<p>Bridge-building was esteemed a
good work in those times, and prayers
were offered for those engaged in
it. At the bidding of the beads, the
faithful were thus invited: "Masters
and frendes, ye shall praye for all
them that bridges and streets make
and amend, that God grant us part
of their good deeds, and them of
ours."</p>

<p>London Bridge was rebuilt of stone
nearly two centuries later. Peter
of S. Mary's, Colechurch, began it.
Henry II. gave towards it the tax on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714">[Pg 714]</a></span>
wool, which led to the saying that
"London Bridge was built on wool-packs."
Peter did not live to complete
it. That was done by Isenbert,
master of the schools at Xainctes&mdash;a
builder of bridges in his own country.
He finished London Bridge in
1280. Near the middle of it was
a Gothic chapel, dedicated to S.
Thomas à Becket, and under the
wool-packs&mdash;that is to say, in the
crypt&mdash;a tomb was hollowed out of a
pier of the bridge for Peter of Colechurch.
When this pier was removed
in 1832, his remains were found
where they had lain nearly six hundred
years. On the Gate-house
of London Bridge was hung the
head of Sir William Wallace. Bishop
Fisher's (of Rochester) was hung
here the very day his cardinal's
hat arrived at Dover; and two weeks
after, that of his friend, Sir Thomas
More. Here, too, were suspended
the heads of F. Garnet, of the Society
of Jesus, and scores of Catholic
priests in Queen Elizabeth's time.</p>

<p>Yes, London is full of Catholic
memories. Bridewell, Bedlam, Mincing
Lane, Tooley St., and many more
are names of Catholic origin, now
corrupted, the derivation of which it
is pleasant to recall as they meet the
eye. One strolls through Paternoster
Row, and Ave Maria Lane, and
by Amen Corner, out of love for
their very names, reminding us of the
Catholic processions around Old S.
Paul's. Shall it be confessed?&mdash;profaner
thoughts here mingle with such
memories. Passing through Paternoster
Row, one naturally looks up,
expecting to see the splendid Mrs.
Bungay come forth to take her drive
with a look of defiance at the chaise-less
Mrs. Bacon at the opposite window!</p>

<p>Not far from here is Christ's Hospital,
so familiar to us all through
Lamb, Coleridge, and Leigh Hunt.
It is at once recognized by the bust
of Edward VI. over the entrance.
It is pleasant to be allowed to wander
through the arcades and quadrangles
at one's pleasure, with no guide
to disturb the delightful memories
evoked by such a place. Going into
a quadrangle, surrounded by a kind
of cloister hung with memorial tablets,
the first thing noticed is a marble
slab on the wall to the right, inscribed:</p>

<p>"In memory of the Rev. James
Boyer, who for many years was head
grammar-master of this Hospital. He
died July 28, 1814, aged seventy-nine
years."</p>

<p>One could not help pausing to
read and copy this tribute to so old
an acquaintance. To be sure, "J.
B. had a heavy hand," which was
rather too familiar with a rod of fearful
omen, but he ground out some
fine scholars, and has been immortalized
by the great geniuses that
expanded under his tuition. I
can see Master Boyer now, as
Charles Lamb describes him, calling
upon the boys with a sardonic grin
to see how neat and fresh his rod
looked!&mdash;see him in his passy, or passionate
wig, make a precipitate entry
into the school-room from his inner
den, and, with his knotty fist doubled
up, and a turbulent eye, single
out some unhappy boy, roaring:
"Od's my life, sirrah! I have a
mind to whip you"; and then, with
a sudden retracting impulse, return
to his lair, and, after a lapse of some
moments, drive out headlong again
with the context which the poor boy
almost hoped was forgotten: "And
I <em>will</em>, too!"&mdash;treating the trembling
culprit to a sandwich of alternate
lash and paragraph till his <i lang="la">rabidus
furor</i> was assuaged.</p>

<p>Lamb, in his delightful essay, <cite>Recollections
of Christ's Hospital</cite>, dwells
on some of his fellow-pupils whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715">[Pg 715]</a></span>
memory one cannot help recalling
while lingering under these arches.
And chief among them, "Samuel
Taylor Coleridge, logician, metaphysician,
bard&mdash;who in these cloisters
unfolded in deep and sweet intonations
the mysteries of Jamblichus or
Plotinus, or recited Homer in his
Greek, or Pindar, while the walls of
the old Grey Friars re-echoed to the
accents of the inspired charity boy."
He tells us, too, of Thomas Fanshawe
Middleton, "a scholar and
a gentleman in his teens," but said
afterwards to have borne his mitre
rather high as the first Protestant
bishop of Calcutta, though a more
humble and apostolic bearing "might
not have been exactly fitted to impress
the minds of those Anglo-Asiatic
diocesans with reverence
for home institutions and the
church which such fathers watered."
There is a monument to the memory
of Bishop Middleton at S. Paul's,
where he is represented, in his robes
of office, in the act of confirming
two East Indians, but the hand raised
over their heads has all the fingers
broken off but one. Let us hope
what apostolic authority he possessed
was centred in that digit!</p>

<p>Above all, at Christ's Hospital one
recalls the gentle Elia himself. Perhaps
in yonder dim corner he furtively
ate the griskin brought from
the paternal kitchen by his aunt.
"I remember the good old relative,"
he says (in whom love forbade pride),
"squatting down upon some odd
stone in a by-nook of the cloisters,
disclosing the viands (of higher regale
than those cates which the ravens
ministered to the Tishbite), and
the contending passions of L. at
the unfolding. There was love for
the bringer, shame for the thing
brought and the manner of its bringing."</p>

<p>Under these pillared arches, so
shadowy to-day with the heavy London
fog, Richardson perhaps conceived
his first dramatic scenes, and
Leigh Hunt began to weave the
delicious fancies that have since
charmed us all. Yonder was the
dormitory the young ass was smuggled
into, which waxed fat, and proclaimed
his good fortune to the world
below, setting concealment any longer
at defiance.</p>

<p>While thus musing, an instalment
of the eight hundred boys at the Hospital
came out to their sports in their
quaint costume of black breeches,
long yellow stockings to the knees,
and a dark-blue gown down to the
heels, garnished with bright buttons
bearing the likeness of Edward VI.,
and confined by a leather belt.
White bands at the neck give them a
clerical look by no means at variance
with so monastic a place. They had
innocent, open faces, such as we find
in our monastic schools, reminding
one of Pope Gregory's well-known
exclamation: "<i lang="la">Non Angli sed angeli.</i>"
They tucked up their skirts and betook
themselves most heartily to their
sports. It was queer to see their
long yellow-stockinged legs flying
across the quadrangle. They have
caps, it is said, about the size of a
saucer, which they dislike so much
that they prefer going bare-headed,
but they did not mind the fog, now
almost amounting to rain. Children,
we all know, are, as Lamb says,
"proof against weather, ingratitude,
meat under-done, and every weapon
of fate." One of them stopped to
pump some water for the visitor to
offer as a libation to the memory of
Charles Lamb.</p>

<p>"Pierian spring!" scornfully shouted
Master Boyer to a young writer
of a classical turn: "the cloister
pump, you mean!"</p>

<p>The school-room visited bore marks
that would have done credit to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716">[Pg 716]</a></span>
a Yankee jack-knife, and revived
pleasant reminiscences of youthful
achievements in a New England
school-house. The chapel, too, with
its mural tablets, and flag tombstones,
and painted window, of
Christ blessing little children, is interesting.
At the right of the chancel
is a remnant of old monastic
charity. An inscription in yellow
letters on a claret-colored ground announces
that "the bread here given
weekly to the poor of the parish of
S. Leonard's is from a bequest of Sir
John Trott and other benefactors,"
and on the other side in equally
glaring characters: "Praise be to
thee, O Lord God, for this thy gift
unto the poor!" There is rather a
more amusing inscription of a similar
nature at S. Giles', Cripplegate, opposite
the monument to Milton:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>
</div>

<p>The said Busby is represented
above this curious inscription, in bold
relief, as a be-ruffed man of jovial
type, holding a bottle in one hand,
and a death's-head in the other, so
that one does not know whether to
laugh or cry. It would be more
reasonable to cry over the grave of
that dreadful prevaricator Fox, called
the Martyrologist, said to be buried
in the same church, only one does
not know where to weep, as the
precise spot is not known. So one
has to be satisfied with sighing
before a huge stone set up to his
memory at the end of the church,
and thinking with Lessing that "if the
world is to be held together by lies,
the old ones which are already current
are as good as the new." What
a pity Fox had not belonged to S.
Pancras' parish! However, that
saint seems to have kept an eye on
him, and avenged the cause of truth.
We do not suppose there are many
now who are credulous enough to
accept Fox as reliable authority concerning
the history of those sad
times. And if we stop to look at his
tablet here, it is with something of
the same feeling that we turn down
Fetter Lane to see where "Praise
God Barebones" and his brother
"Damned Barebones" lived, and
wonder how any one house could
hold them both.</p>

<p>But to return to Christ's Hospital.
It must not be supposed that, meanwhile,
it has been forgotten that this
institution was originally a Catholic
foundation. It was the first thought
at entering, nor could the pleasant
associations of later years prevent a
regret that so monastic a building
is no longer peopled by the old Grey
Friars. Keats' lines recurred to
memory:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Mute is the matin bell whose early call<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Warned the Grey fathers from their humble beds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor midnight taper gleams along the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or round the sculptured saint its radiance sheds!"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>It was on the second of February,
1224, during the pontificate of
Honorius III. and the reign of King
Henry III., S. Francis of Assisi being
still alive, that a small band of
Franciscan friars landed at Dover.
There were four priests and five lay-brothers.
Five of this number stop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_717" id="Page_717">[Pg 717]</a></span>ped
at Canterbury to found a house,
and the remainder came on to London.
The simplicity of their manners
and mode of life made them popular
at once, and they speedily acquired
the means of building a house and
church. Among other benefactors,
John Ewin, or Iwin, a citizen of London,
gave them an estate, as he says in
the deed of conveyance, "for the
health of my soul, in pure and perpetual
alms," and became a lay-brother in
the house, leaving behind him, when
he died, a holy memory as a strict
and devout observer of the rule.
A large church adapted to their
wants was completed in the year
1327, and dedicated to "the honor
of God and our alone Saviour Jesus
Christ." It was three hundred feet
long, eighty-nine feet broad, and
seventy-four feet high. Queen Margaret
gave two thousand marks
towards it, and the first stone was
laid in her name. John of Brittany,
Earl of Richmond, and his niece,
the Countess of Pembroke, gave the
hangings, vestments, and sacred vessels.
Isabella, the mother of Edward
III., and Philippa, his queen, also
gave money for its completion. The
thirty-six windows were the gifts of
various charitable persons. The western
window, being destroyed in a
gale, was restored by Edward III.,
"for the repose of the soul" of his
mother, who had just been buried before
the choir. In 1380, Margaret,
Countess of Norfolk, erected new
stalls in the choir, at a cost of three
hundred and fifty marks. Many
nobles were buried here&mdash;four queens,
four duchesses, four countesses, one
duke, two earls, eight barons, thirty-five
knights&mdash;in all, six hundred and
sixty-three persons of quality. Among
them was Margaret, the second wife
of Edward I., and granddaughter
of S. Louis, King of France. She
was buried before the high altar.
In the choir lay Isabella, wife of
Edward II.&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"She-wolf of France with unrelenting fangs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who tore the bowels of her mangled mate"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>beneath a monument of alabaster,
with the heart of her murdered husband
on her breast! Near her lay
her daughter Joanna, wife of Edward
Bruce of Scotland. Here too was
buried Lady Venitia Digby, so celebrated
for her beauty, the wife of
Sir Kenelm Digby, who erected over
her a monument of black marble.</p>

<p>In the middle ages the great ones
of the world, at the approach of
death, the all-leveller, feeling the
nothingness of earthly grandeur and
riches, often sought to be buried
among Christ's poor ones, and not
unfrequently in their habit, not thinking
"in Franciscan weeds to pass
disguised," but as an act of faith in the
evangelical counsels, and a recognition
of the importance of being
clothed with Christ's righteousness.
It was a public confession that the
vain garments they had worn in the
world had been as poisonous to them
as the tunic Hercules put on. Dante
laid down to die in the cowl and
mantle of a Franciscan. Cervantes
was buried in the same habit. Louis
of Orleans, who was murdered by the
Duke of Burgundy, was buried among
the Celestin monks in the habit of
their order. Anne of Brittany, twice
Queen of France, wore the scapular
of the Carmelites, and wished it to
be sent with her heart in a golden
box to her beloved Bretons.</p>

<p>The Grey Friars' church was destroyed
at the great fire, and the
monastery greatly injured. There
are still some portions of it remaining,
however, which are at once recognized.
Some of the books of the
old monastic library are still preserved&mdash;a
library founded by Sir
Richard Whittington, thrice Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_718" id="Page_718">[Pg 718]</a></span>
Mayor of London, the hero of the
nursery rhyme, to whom the Bowbells
sounded so auspiciously. He
laid the foundation of this library in
1421, and gave four hundred pounds
towards furnishing it. The remainder
of the books were given, or collected
by one of the friars.</p>

<p>It seems that, after all, Edward
VI. was not the founder of the modern
institution of Christ's Hospital.
He merely gave it its name, and
added to the endowment. When the
monastery was suppressed by his
father, it was given to the municipality
of London, and the city
authorities conceived the idea of converting
it into a refuge for poor children.
It was chiefly endowed by the
citizens themselves, though aided by
grants from Henry VIII. and Edward
VI.</p>

J. Mullock, D.D., Bishop of Newfoundland.

1873.</p></div>

<p>S. Alphonsus has never found a perfectly
competent biographer, and perhaps
never will. F. Tannoja has written full
and minute memoirs, containing all the
facts and events of his life, but he wrote
under the fear of the Neapolitan censorship,
and could not speak openly of the
miserable infidel Tanucci and the other
Jansenists and infidels, or faithless Catholics,
of the wretched period in which
the saint lived, and the corrupt court
with which he had to contend. Moreover,
Tannoja had not a sufficiently elevated
and comprehensive mind to be
able to appreciate and describe the life
and times of S. Alphonsus in their higher
and broader relations. The Oratorian
translation of his life is a most wretched
and shabby affair in respect to style and
accuracy. The religious lady who has
prepared the first of the lives placed at
the head of this notice has therefore done
a very great service to the Catholic public
by compiling a careful and readable
biography from the other earlier works of
the kind, and adding some interesting
particulars concerning the history of the
modern Redemptorists.</p>

<p>Bishop Mullock's life of the saint is
quite brief and compendious, but of the
best quality so far as it goes. The publisher
has made a great blunder in omitting
the title of Doctor of the Universal
Church, which has been given to S. Alphonsus
since Dr. Mullock's life was first
published, on the title-page.</p>

<p>Archbishop Manning, who has given,
though in brief form, the best appreciation
of the character and work of the great doctor
which we have seen, truly says that S.
Ignatius, S. Charles, and S. Alphonsus are
the three great modern leaders of the
church in her warfare. As one of this great
trio, S. Alphonsus deserves to be universally
known and honored among the faithful,
and we rejoice in the publication of the
biography compiled by the accomplished
Sister of Mercy as the best we have in
English, wishing it a wide circulation, as
a means of promoting devotion to the
latest of the doctors and one of the greatest
of the saints.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lives of the Irish Saints.</span> Vol. I., No.
1. By Rev. John O'Hanlon. Dublin:
Duffy &amp; Co.</p></div>

<p>It is not often that we have the privilege
of noticing such a work as this&mdash;the
labor of a lifetime, the history of a
whole nation's sanctity. Since Alban
Butler, no such hagiographer as F.
O'Hanlon has appeared, nor has any
work on hagiology so full of interest and
importance been given to the world. Up
to this time the saints of Ireland, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_719" id="Page_719">[Pg 719]</a></span>
few exceptions, were hidden saints; of
the three or four thousand souls who
have shed upon her the light of their
sanctity, and earned for her the glorious
title of the "Island of Saints," the world
knew scarcely anything. It was in vain
that the ancient annalists compiled voluminous
records for the benefit of posterity;
those that escaped the hands of
the spoiler were left unexamined, and
the learned of the nation seemed to have
forgotten that their country had a holy
and heroic past, whose history it was their
sacred duty to look into and perpetuate.
No attention was given to traditions of
bygone days; no light was thrown
upon them; they were fast becoming dim
and obscure, and what was, in reality,
fact, the rising generation was beginning
to regard as fable. This neglect, so ruinous,
and even criminal, might have gone
on till it became irreparable, had not
this learned and devoted priest undertaken
the great task of redeeming the
past of Erin's sanctity from the oblivion
into which it was rapidly sinking. How
carefully he prepared himself, and how
well qualified he is to perform this labor
of patriotism and love, the first number
of his work gives ample proof. His acquaintance
with Irish lore, his erudition
and research, his fine style, all combine
to make him the fittest person that could
have engaged in so great a work.</p>

<p>Were we disposed to find fault with
him at all, we should say he is rather critical;
at least, we fancy we perceive in
him a tendency to conform to the critical
spirit of the age, which perhaps is prudent,
after all, and may enhance the historical
value of the work, though it will
mar somewhat, we think, the poetic
beauty it ought to possess.</p>

<p>No literary effort has yet been attempted
that appeals so strongly to the national
and religious sentiments of the Irish
people; and none should receive so
large a share of their interest and support.
F. O'Hanlon's <cite>Lives of the Irish
Saints</cite>, when completed, will be a noble
monument to Erin's faith and Erin's glory,
to which his countrymen in every
land should feel proud to contribute;
the appreciation that he meets with may
encourage others to enter the comparatively
unexplored mine of Irish history,
and bring to light the treasures it contains.</p>

<p>We learn that F. O'Hanlon, who is a
citizen of the United States, has copyrighted
the work here, and it is to be
hoped will make arrangements for its
reissue in this country. Meanwhile, intending
subscribers may address the author
directly, or order the book through
"The Catholic Publication Society," New
York. It will be published serially, and

<p>Another publication throwing light on
the period of the Elizabethan persecution
of Catholics, and more especially on
the part borne by the Jesuits themselves
in this heroic struggle. So many books
have appeared lately on this subject that
we may almost say that a new branch of
Catholic literature has been opened in
the English language. The "getting up"
of this book is worthy of the subject, and
we rejoice that it is so; for, to take a
simile from a passage in this very volume,
we may say with truth of the outward appearance
of a book in these times what
the holy lay-brother, Thomas Pounde,
considered his rich dress in prison to be:
"A means of inspiring Catholics with
greater courage, and conciliating authority"
(p. 42). The history of the three
confessors of the faith, Thomas Pounde,
George Gilbert, and F. Darbyshire, is
very interesting. In the two former we
have examples of lay sanctity and constancy,
as distinguished from that of
priests, though both saints were in heart
members of the Society of Jesus, to which
one was affiliated by extraordinary dispensation
of the ordinary novitiate, and
the other received the habit and pronounced
his vows <i lang="la">in articulo mortis</i>. Thomas
Pounde, of Belmont, a man of old
family and high connections, had all the
burning zeal of a convert whose soul had
narrowly escaped the everlasting infamy
of the life of a court minion. Not only
his fearlessness and constancy, but his
high intellectual attainments, claim our
attention. Thirty years of perpetual imprisonment
had not enfeebled his mind,
and his one desire was a public disputation
with his adversaries, nay, "with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_720" id="Page_720">[Pg 720]</a></span>
Beza and all the doctors of Geneva," if
it pleased his foes to reinforce themselves
with such noted aid. In a lengthy paper,
written in 1580 to show that the Bible
alone is not the true rule of faith, he
brings forward the same reasons which
we hear so much about in our day, and
after specially dwelling on the many articles
of universally held Christian faith
that are <em>not</em> directly and plainly traceable
to Scripture, he says pointedly: "Do not
these blind guides, think you, lead a trim
daunce towards infidelitie?" He could not
have spoken otherwise had he meant his
apology for the XIXth instead of the
XVIth century.</p>

<p>George Gilbert, also of a good English
family, was one of those rich men who, in
truth, make themselves the stewards of
the Lord. With him originated the useful
and ingenious Catholic Association,
in which young men of the world bound
themselves to become the temporal guides,
helpers, couriers, furnishers of the priests
who labored spiritually for the conversion
of England. The companion of F. Parsons,
as Pounde had been of F. Campion,
he, too, was a convert not only from
courtly vanities, but from actual Calvinism.
Ardently desiring martyrdom, he
nevertheless embraced obediently and
lovingly the cross of a "sluggish death
in bed"; but at least the pain of exile had
been added to imprisonment, for he was
banished from his native land, and died
at Rome in 1583. His whole substance
was offered to the service of God, and
what little remained at his death he left
to the Society for the spiritual needs of
his country. It was not till he lay upon
his death-bed that he pronounced his
vows.</p>

<p>F. Darbyshire was as learned as he was
zealous. While in France preparing for
his perilous English mission, he refused
the honors of the pulpit and the professorial
chair, and confined himself to
giving catechetical instruction; but God
so rewarded his humility that grave scholars
and theologians would flock to hear
him, and make notes of the wonderful
learning he displayed, while they admired
the eloquence he could not hide. He and
his friend, F. Henry Tichborne, might
well congratulate themselves, later on, on
the holy efficacy of persecution, which had
caused the "confluence of the rares and
bestes wittes of our nation to the seminaries,"
and of the happy increase in the number
of fervent inmates of the foreign seminaries
They descant, too, on the unwise
policy of persecution, and the fact that no
religion was ever permanently established
by the sword. The faith might have been
reft of one of its greatest glories in England
had not a short-sighted fanaticism
resorted to violent means to uproot it.
F. Darbyshire died in exile in France in
1604, in the very same place, Pont-à-Mousson,
where he had so signally distinguished
himself for learning and for
modesty in the beginning of his apostolate.</p>

<p>This book is written in simple, Saxon
style. The author trusts rather to facts
than to rhetoric, just as of old the acts of
the martyrs were chronicled without much
comment, whether descriptive or panegyrical.
The volume bears "First Series"
on its title-page, as a promise that it is
but the prelude to other biographies as
interesting. Let us hope that the promise
will be speedily fulfilled.</p>

<h3>JOHN STUART MILL.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></h3>


<p>In 1764, Hume met, at the house
of Baron d'Holbach, a party of the
most celebrated Frenchmen of that
day; and the Scotchman took occasion
to introduce a discussion
concerning the existence of an
atheist, in the strict sense of the
word; for his own part, he said, he
had never chanced to meet with
one. "You have been unfortunate,"
replied Holbach; "but at the present
moment you are sitting at table
with seventeen of them."</p>

<p>Whether or not the leading men
among the positivists and cosmists
of England to-day are prepared
to be as frank as the Baron
d'Holbach, we shall not venture
to say; at all events, John Stuart
Mill, to whom they all looked up
with the reverence of disciples for
the master, has taken care that the
world should not remain in doubt
concerning his opinions on this
subject, which, of all others, is of
the deepest interest to man. Among
those who in this century have labored
most earnestly to propagate
an atheistic philosophy, based on
the assumption that the human
mind is incapable of knowing aught
beyond relations, he certainly holds
a place of distinction, and, as a representative
of what is called scientific
atheism, the history of his opinions
is worthy of serious attention.</p>

<p>It was known some time before
his death that he had written an
autobiography; and when it was
announced that his step-daughter,
Miss Taylor, whom he had made
his literary executrix, was about to
publish the work, the attention of
at least those who take interest in
the profounder controversies of the
age was awakened.</p>

<p>As an autobiography, the book
has but little merit; though this
should not be insisted on, since
success in writing of this kind is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_722" id="Page_722">[Pg 722]</a></span>extremely rare. If it is almost as
difficult in any case to write a life
well as to spend it well, when one
attempts to become the historian
of his own life, there is every
probability that he will either be
ridiculous or uninteresting. Mill,
too, it must be conceded, had but
poor material at his command.
His life was uneventful, uninviting
even, in its surroundings; and when
the patchwork of his philosophical
opinions is taken away, there is little
left in it that is not wholly commonplace.</p>

<p>He was born in London, in 1806,
and was the eldest son of James
Mill, who was a charity student of
divinity at the University of Edinburgh,
but, becoming disgusted
with the doctrines of Presbyterianism,
gave up all idea of studying for
the ministry, and in a short while
renounced Christian faith, and became
an avowed atheist, though
his atheism was negative; his belief
in what is called the relativity
of knowledge not justifying him in
affirming positively that there is no
God, but only in holding that the
human mind can never know
whether there be a God or not.
He, however, did not stop here,
but, scandalized by the suffering
which is everywhere in the world,
forgot his own principles, and maintained
that it is absurd to suppose
that such a world is the work of an
infinitely perfect being, and was rather
inclined to accept the Manichean
theory of a good and evil
principle, struggling against each
other for the government of the
universe. But of God, as revealed
in Christ, he had a hatred as satanical
as that of Voltaire.</p>

<p>"I have a hundred times heard
him say," writes his son, "that all
ages and nations have represented
their gods as wicked, in a constantly
increasing progression; that mankind
have gone on, adding trait after
trait, till they reached the most
perfect conception of wickedness
which the human mind can devise,
and have called this God, and prostrated
themselves before it. This
<i lang="fr">ne plus ultra</i> of wickedness he considered
to be embodied in what is
commonly presented to mankind as
the creed of Christianity."<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> In
other words&mdash;for Mill can mean nothing
less&mdash;he held that the character
of Christ, as portrayed in the
Gospel, is the highest possible conception
of all that is depraved and
repulsive; that Christ, instead of
being incarnate God, is the essence
of wickedness clothed in bodily
form; that, compared with him, or at
least with the God whom he called
his father, Moloch, Astarte, Jupiter,
Venus, Mars, and Bacchus are pure
divinities; and from the manner in
which the son narrates these opinions
of his father, he evidently desires
that we should infer that they
are also his own.</p>

<p>The elder Mill, who seems to
have been a natural pedagogue,
took the education of his son exclusively
into his own hands, and
was most careful not to allow him
to acquire any impressions contrary
to his own sentiments respecting religion.
Instead of teaching him to
believe that God created the heavens
and the earth, he taught him to
believe that we can know nothing
whatever of the manner in which
the world came into existence, and
that the question, "Who made
you?" is one which cannot be answered,
since we possess no authentic
information on the subject.</p>

<p>To show, however, his father's
conviction of the logical connection
between Protestantism and infidelity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_723" id="Page_723">[Pg 723]</a></span>
he records that he taught him
to take the strongest interest in the
Reformation, "as the great and decisive
contest against priestly tyranny
for liberty of thought."</p>

<p>"I am thus," he adds, "one of
the very few examples in this country
of one who has not thrown off
religious belief, but never had it;
I grew up in a negative state with
regard to it."<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>How he could grow up in a negative
condition with regard to religion
is not easily understood when we
consider that his father instilled into
his mind from his earliest years the
doctrine that the very essence of religion
is evil, since it is, and ever has
been, worship paid to the demon, the
highest possible conception of wickedness;
though he was at the same
time careful to impress upon him
the duty of concealing his belief on
this subject; and this lesson of parental
prudence was, as the younger
Mill himself informs us, attended
with some moral disadvantages.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>These moral disadvantages, in
his own opinion at least, were without
positive influence upon his
character, since through the whole
book there runs the tacit assumption
of his own perfect goodness.
I am an atheist, he seems to say,
and yet I am a saint; and he is
evidently persuaded that his own
life is sufficient proof that the notion
that unbelief is generally connected
with bad qualities either of
mind or heart is merely a vulgar
prejudice.</p>

<p>"The world would be astonished,"
he informs us, "if it knew how
great a proportion of its brightest
ornaments, of those most distinguished
even in popular estimation
for wisdom and virtue, are complete
sceptics in religion....
But the best of them (unbelievers),
as no one who has had opportunities
of really knowing them will
hesitate to affirm, are more genuinely
religious, in the best sense of the
word religion, than those who exclusively
arrogate to themselves
the title."<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>This is probably not more extravagant
than the assertion that
the God of Christianity is the embodiment
of all that is fiendish and
wicked.</p>

<p>We cannot, however, pass so lightly
over this portion of Mill's book,
or dismiss without further examination
the assumption that the best
are they who refuse to believe in
God, and hold that man is merely
an animal.</p>

<p>The real controversy of the age,
as thoughtful men have long since
recognized, is not between the
church and the sects. Protestantism,
from the beginning, by asserting
the supremacy of human reason, denied
the sovereignty of God, and in
its postulates, at least, was atheistic.
Hence Catholic theologians have
never had any difficulty in showing
that rebellion against the authority
of the church is revolt against that
of Christ, which is apostasy from
God. To this argument there is
really no reply, and the difficulties
which Protestants have sought to
raise against the church are based
upon a sophism which underlies all
non-Catholic thought.</p>

<p>The pseudo-reformers objected
that the church could not be of
Christ, because in it there was evil;
many of its members were sinful;
as the deists hold that the Bible
is not the word of God, because of
the many seeming incongruities
and imperfections which are every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_724" id="Page_724">[Pg 724]</a></span>where
found in it; as the atheists
teach that the universe cannot be
the work of an all-wise and omnipotent
Being, since it is filled with
suffering and death; and that love
cannot be creation's final law,
since nature, "red in tooth and
claw with ravin," shrieks against
this creed.</p>

<p>If the imperfections and abuses
in the practical workings of the
church are arguments against its
divine institution and authority,
then undoubtedly the "measureless
ill" which is in the world is reason
for doubting whether a Being infinitely
good is its author.</p>

<p>Hence the traditional objections
of Protestants to the church are, in
the ultimate analysis, reducible to
the atheistic sophism, which, because
there is evil in the creature,
seeks to conclude that the creator
cannot be wholly good; not perceiving
that it would be as reasonable
to demand that the circle
should be square as to ask that the
finite should be without defect.</p>

<p>The church is, both logically and
historically, the only defensible
Christianity; as Jean Jacques Rousseau
long ago admitted in the well-known
words: "Prove to me that
in matters of religion I must accept
authority, and I will become a
Catholic to-morrow." There is no
controversy to-day between the
church and Protestantism which is
worthy of serious attention. All
that is important has been said on
this subject, and Protestants themselves
begin to understand that it is
far wiser for them to try to hold on
to the shreds of Christian belief
which still remain to them than to
waste their strength in attacks on
the church, which, as they are
coming to recognize, is after all the
strongest bulwark of faith in the
soul and in God.</p>

<p>The ground of debate to-day is
back of heterodoxy and orthodoxy;
it lies around the central fact in
all religion&mdash;God himself.</p>

<p>The scientific theories of the present
time, if they do not deny the
existence of God, are at least based
upon hypotheses which ignore him
and his action in the world; and
the few attempts which have been
made to construct what may be
called a philosophy of science all
proceed upon the assumption that,
whether there be a God or not,
science cannot recognize his existence.</p>

<p>The faith which the elder Mill
taught his son&mdash;that of the manner
in which the world came into existence
nothing can be known&mdash;is
that which most scientists accept.
The desire to organize society upon
an atheistic basis is also very manifest
and very general.</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>The idealistic philosophy of Germany,
invariably terminating in pantheism,
is another proof of the atheistic
tendency of modern thought.</p>

<p>Mill, in his <cite>Autobiography</cite>, has of
course made no attempt to prove
that there is no God. On the contrary,
as we have already stated, he
has admitted that this proposition
cannot be proved; but he believes
there is no God, fails to perceive
any evidence of design in the universe,
and, from a morbid sense of
the evil which abounds, feels justified
in concluding that the cosmos is
not the work of an infinitely good
and omnipotent Being.</p>

<p>Dr. Newman, in his <cite>Apologia</cite>, a
work of the same character as the
<cite>Autobiography</cite> of Mill, but which
will be read with delight when Mill
and his book will have been forgotten,
has seen this difficulty, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_725" id="Page_725">[Pg 725]</a></span>
given expression to it in his own
inimitable manner. "To consider
the world," he writes, "in its length
and breadth, its various history, the
many races of man, their starts,
their fortunes, their mutual alienation,
their conflicts; and then their
ways, habits, governments, forms of
worship; their enterprises, their aimless
courses, their random achievements
and acquirements, the impotent
conclusion of long-standing
facts; the tokens, so faint and
broken, of a superintending design;
the blind evolution of what turn
out to be great powers or truths;
the progress of things, as if from
unreasoning elements, not toward
final causes; the greatness and littleness
of man, his far-reaching aims,
his short duration, the curtain hung
over his futurity, the disappointments
of life, the defeat of good,
the success of evil, physical pain,
mental anguish, the prevalence and
intensity of sin, the pervading idolatries,
the corruptions, the dreary,
hopeless irreligion, that condition
of the whole race so fearfully yet
exactly described in the apostle's
words, 'having no hope, and without
God in the world'&mdash;all this is a
vision to dizzy and appall, and inflicts
upon the mind the sense of a
profound mystery which is absolutely
beyond human solution."<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>But, as Dr. Newman expresses
it, ten thousand difficulties do not
make one doubt. Difficulty and
doubt are incommensurate. When
we have sufficient reasons for accepting
two seemingly contradictory
propositions, the fact that
we are unable to reconcile them
should not be a motive for rejecting
them. The human race has accepted,
in all time, the existence of
God with an assent as real as that
with which it has believed in the
substance that underlies the phenomenon.
To a countless number
of minds, the difficulty to which
Mill has given such emphasis has
presented itself with a force not
less than that with which it struck
him.</p>

<p>Millions have approached the
mystery of evil, and have asked
themselves</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Are God and nature, then, at strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That nature lends such evil dreams?"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But they have not weakly refused
to believe in God because they
could not comprehend his works.
They saw the evil; but the deepest
instincts of the soul&mdash;the longing
for immortal life, the craving for
the unattainable, the thirst for a
knowledge never given, the sense
of the emptiness of what seems
most real; the mother-ideas of human
reason&mdash;those of being, of
cause, of the absolute, the infinite,
the eternal, the sense of the all-beautiful,
the all-perfect&mdash;made
them fall</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Upon the great world's altar-stairs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That slope through darkness up to God,"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>and stretch hands of faith, and trust
the larger hope.</p>

<p>We do not propose to offer any
arguments to prove that God is, or
to show that his existence is reconcilable
with the evil in the world,
since Mill has not attempted to establish
the contradictory of this;
but we wish merely to state that
his apprehension of the difficulties
which surround this question is not
keener than that of thousands of
others who have seen no connection
between apprehending these difficulties
and doubting the doctrines
to which they are attached. Whilst
admitting that science can never
prove that there is no God, Mill
evidently intended his <em>Autobiogra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_726" id="Page_726">[Pg 726]</a></span>phy</em>
to be an argument against the
usefulness of belief in God for moral
and social purposes; "which,"
he tells us, "of all the parts of the
discussion concerning religion, is
the most important in this age, in
which real belief in any religious
doctrine is feeble and precarious, but
the opinion of its necessity for moral
and social purposes almost universal;
and when those who reject
revelation very generally take refuge
in an optimistic deism&mdash;a worship
of the order of nature and the
supposed course of Providence&mdash;at
least as full of contradictions
and perverting to the moral sentiments
as any of the forms of Christianity,
if only it is as fully realized."<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>
Confessing the inability of
the scientists to prove that there is
no God, he thinks that they should
devote their efforts to the attempt
to show that belief in God is not
beneficial either to the individual or
to society. We shall, therefore, turn
to the question of morality, which is
enrooted in metaphysics, out of
which it grows, and to which it is indebted
both for its meaning and its
strength.</p>

<p>Can the atheistic philosophy
give to morality a solid basis? To
deny the existence of an infinitely
perfect Being is to affirm that there
is no absolute goodness, no moral
law, eternal, immutable, and necessary,
no act that in itself is either
good or bad, no certain and fixed
standard of right and wrong.</p>

<p>Hence atheistic philosophy can
give to morality no other foundation
than that of pleasure or utility:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Atque ipsa utilitas justi prope mater et aequi,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nec natura potest justo secernere iniquum."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>And, in fact, this has been the doctrine,
we may say, of all those who
have denied the existence of God.</p>

<p>Epicurus, Lucretius, Hobbes,
Helvetius, Volney, and the whole
Voltairean tribe in France, have
all substantially taken this view
of the question of morality; and
Mill's opinion on the subject did
not, except in form, differ from
theirs. His father was the friend
of Bentham, an advocate of the
utilitarian theory of morality,
which he applied to civil and criminal
law; and young Mill became
an enthusiastic disciple of the Benthamic
philosophy.</p>

<p>"The principle of utility," he
writes, "understood as Bentham understood
it, and applied in the manner
in which he applied it through
these three volumes, fell exactly
into its place as the keystone which
held together the detached and
fragmentary component parts of
my knowledge and beliefs. It gave
unity to my conceptions of things.
I now had opinions, a creed, a
doctrine, a philosophy; in one
among the best senses of the word,
a religion; the inculcation and diffusion
of which could be made the
principal outward purpose of a
life."<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>Bentham sought to save the ethics
of utility by generalizing the
principle of self-interest into that
of the greatest happiness; and it
was this "greatest-happiness principle"
that gave Mill what he calls a
religion. Though less grovelling
than the theory of self-interest, yet,
equally with it, it deprives morality
of a solid foundation, substitutes
force for right, and consecrates all
tyranny.</p>

<p>If there be no God, and interest
is the sole criterion of what is good,
in the name of what am I commanded
to sacrifice my particular interest
to general interest? If interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_727" id="Page_727">[Pg 727]</a></span>
is the law, then my own interest is
the first and highest. If happiness
be the supreme end of life, and
there be no life beyond this life, in
order to ask of me the sacrifice of
my happiness, it must be called for
in the name of some other principle
than happiness itself.</p>

<p>And if "the thoughts of men are
widened with the process of the
suns,</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What is that to him that reaps not harvest of his youthful joys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' the deep heart of existence beat for ever like a boy's?"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Besides being false, this "greatest-happiness
principle" is impossible
in practice. Who can tell what is
for the greatest good of the greatest
number? It is very difficult, often
impossible, when we consider only
our individual interest, to decide
what actions will be most conducive
to our happiness, in the utilitarian
sense of the word. How, then,
are we to decide when the interests
of a whole people, of humanity, and
for all future time, are to be consulted?
Would any atheist of the
school of Mill, who is not wholly
fanatical, dare affirm that the greatest
number would be happier, even
in a low and animal sense, without
faith in God and a future life?
And yet, according to his own
theory, unless he is certain of this
when he attempts to destroy the
religious belief of his fellow-beings,
his act is immoral.</p>

<p>Was it not in the name of, and in
strict accordance with, the principles
of this theory that Comte planned
what Mill calls "the completest
system of spiritual and temporal
despotism which ever yet emanated
from a human brain, unless,
possibly, that of Ignatius Loyola&mdash;a
system by which the yoke of general
opinion, wielded by an organized
body of spiritual teachers and
rulers, would be made supreme
over every action, and, as far as is
in human possibility, every thought
of every member of the community,
as well in the things which regard
only himself as in those which
concern the interests of others"?<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>There is yet another vice in this
system. If the good is the greatest
interest of the greatest number,
then there are only public and social
ethics, and personal morality
does not exist. Our duties are towards
others, and we have no duties
towards ourselves. Thus the very
source of moral life is dried up.</p>

<p>Let us come to considerations
less general and more immediately
connected with Mill's life.</p>

<p>Of his father's opinions on this
subject he says: "In his views of
life, he partook of the character of
the Stoic, the Epicurean, and the
Cynic, not in the modern but the
ancient sense of the word. In his
personal qualities the Stoic predominated.
His standard of morals
was Epicurean, inasmuch as it was
utilitarian, taking as the exclusive
test of right and wrong the tendency
of actions to produce pleasure
or pain. But he had (and this was
the Cynic element) scarcely any belief
in pleasure, at least in his later
years, of which alone, on this
point, I can speak confidently....
He thought human life a poor thing
at best after the freshness of youth
and of unsatisfied curiosity had
gone by.... He would sometimes
say that if life were made
what it might be by good government
and good education, it would
be worth having; but he never
spoke with anything like enthusiasm
even of that possibility."<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>This certainly is a gloomy, not
to say hopeless, view of life, and
one which, in spite of Mill's attempt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_728" id="Page_728">[Pg 728]</a></span>to produce a contrary impression,
pervades the whole book. The
thoughtful reader cannot help feeling
that Mill's state of mind was
very like that described by the
apostle: "having no hope, and without
God in the world." A deep and
settled dissatisfaction with all he
saw around him, the feeling that all
was wrong&mdash;society, religion, government,
the family, human life, the
philosophic opinions of the whole
world except himself, together with
an undercurrent of despair, which
made him doubt whether they would
ever be right, gave a coloring of
melancholy to his character which
he is unable to hide. Life was no
boon, and not even the faintest ray
of light pierced the black gloom of
the grave.</p>

<p>Of his father he writes: "In
ethics, his moral feelings were energetic
and rigid on all points which
he deemed important to human
well-being, while he was supremely
indifferent in opinion (though his
indifference did not show itself in
personal conduct) to all those doctrines
of the common morality
which he thought had no foundation
but in asceticism and priest-craft.
He looked forward, for example,
to a considerable increase of
freedom in the relations between
the sexes, though without pretending
to define exactly what would
be, or ought to be, the precise conditions
of that freedom."<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>Here we have an instance of the
truth of the inference which we
have already drawn from the principles
of the utilitarian ethics&mdash;that
they take no account of personal
purity of character, and teach
that man's duties are towards
others, and not towards himself.
There is a still more striking example
of this in Mill's <cite>Autobiography</cite>.</p>

<p>He early in life made the acquaintance
of a married lady, for
whom he conceived a very strong
affection. He spent a good deal
of his time with her, and says: "I
was greatly indebted to the strength
of character which enabled her to
disregard the false interpretations
liable to be put on the frequency
of my visits to her while living
generally apart from Mr. Taylor,
and on our occasionally travelling
together"; though their relation
at that time, he tells us, was only
that of strong affection and confidential
intimacy. The reason
which he assigns for this is certainly
most curious: "For though," he
says, "we did not consider the ordinances
of society binding on a subject
so entirely personal, we did
feel bound that our conduct
should be such as in no degree
to bring discredit on her husband,
nor therefore on herself."<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>In other words, Mill recognizes
no obligation of personal purity,
even in the married, but holds that
unchastity is wrong only when it
brings discredit on others; though
he was unfaithful even to this loose
ethical code, since, according to his
own account, his conduct was such
as to be liable to misinterpretation,
and, therefore, such as might bring
disgrace upon the husband of the
woman with whom he was associating.</p>

<p>His hatred of marriage and of
the restraints which it imposes is
seen in several parts of the work
before us.</p>

<p>Of the Saint-Simonians he says:
"I honored them most of all for what
they have been most cried down
for&mdash;the boldness and freedom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_729" id="Page_729">[Pg 729]</a></span>
from prejudice with which they
treated the subject of the family,
the most important of any, and
needing more fundamental alterations
than remain to be made in
any other great social institution,
but on which scarcely any reformer
has the courage to touch. In proclaiming
the perfect equality of men
and women, and an entirely new
order of things in regard to their
relations with one another, the Saint-Simonians,
in common with Owen
and Fourier, have entitled themselves
to the grateful remembrance
of future generations."<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>A man who puts himself forward
as the advocate of free-love should
not, one would think, insist especially
on the moralities, or give
himself prominence as a proof that
belief in God is not useful either to
the individual or to society.</p>

<p>Mill's social ethics are of the
same character. He is a socialist
of the most radical type, and considers
the great problem of the future
to be how to unite the greatest
individual liberty of action with
a common ownership in the raw
material of the globe, and an equal
participation of all in the benefits
of combined labor; though the
"uncultivated herd who now compose
the laboring masses," as well as
the mental and moral condition of
the immense majority of their employers,
convince him that this
social transformation is not now
either possible or desirable. Still,
his ethics lead him to hope that
private property will be abolished,
and that the whole earth will be
converted into a kind of industrial
school, in which every man, woman,
and child will be required to do
certain work, and receive in remuneration
whatever the controllers of
the general capital may see fit to
give them. Thus, in the name of
the greatest good of the greatest
number, personal purity, the family,
private property, society, are all to
be no more, and the human race is
to be managed somewhat like a
model stock-farm, in which everything,
from breeding down to the
minutest details of food and exercise,
is to be under the control of
a supervisory committee.</p>

<p>As we have already seen, Mill,
after reading Bentham, got what he
called a religion: he had an object in
life&mdash;to be a reformer of the world.</p>

<p>This did very well for a time;
but in the autumn of 1826, whilst,
as he expresses it, he was in a dull
state of nerves, he awakened as
from a dream. He put the question
to himself: "'Suppose that
all your objects in life were realized;
that all the changes in institutions
and opinions to which you
are looking forward could be effected
at this very instant; would
this be a great joy and happiness
to you?' And an irrepressible self-consciousness
distinctly answered,
'No!' At this my heart sank within
me; the whole foundation on
which my life was constructed fell
down.... I seemed to have nothing
left to live for.</p>

<p>"At first I hoped that the cloud
would pass away of itself; but it
did not.... I carried it with me
into all companies, into all occupations.
Hardly anything had
power to cause me even a few minutes'
oblivion of it.... The lines
in Coleridge's 'Dejection'&mdash;I was
not then acquainted with them&mdash;exactly
describe my case:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'A grief without a pang, void, dark, and drear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A drowsy, stifled, unimpassioned grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which finds no natural outlet or relief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In word, or sigh, or tear.'"<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_730" id="Page_730">[Pg 730]</a></span></p>

<p>He now felt that his father had
committed a blunder in the education
which he had given him; that
the habit of analysis has a tendency
to wear away the feelings and dry
up the fountains of pleasurable
emotions; that it is a perpetual
worm at the root both of the passions
and of the virtues; and, above
all, fearfully undermines all desires
and all pleasures which are the effects
of association.</p>

<p>"My education, I thought, had
failed to create these feelings in sufficient
strength to resist the dissolving
influence of analysis, while the
whole course of my intellectual cultivation
had made precocious and
premature analysis the inveterate
habit of my mind. I was thus, as
I said to myself, left stranded at the
commencement of my voyage, with
a well-equipped ship and a rudder,
but no sail; without any real desire
for the ends which I had been
so carefully fitted out to work for;
no delight in virtue or the general
good, but also just as little in
anything else.... I frequently
asked myself if I could, or if I
was bound to, go on living, when
life must be passed in this manner.
I generally answered to myself
that I did not think I could
possibly bear it beyond a year."<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>This sad state of mind was the
protest of the soul against the skeleton
of intellectual formulas into
which it had been cramped. A
man is not going to live or die for
conclusions, opinions, calculations,
analytical nothings. Man is not
and cannot be made to be a mere
reasoning machine, a contrivance
to grind out syllogisms. He is a
seeing, feeling, contemplating, believing,
acting animal. We cannot
construct a philosophy of life upon
abstract conclusions of the analytical
faculty; life is action and for
action, and, if we insist on analyzing
and proving everything, we shall
never come to action. Humanity
is a mere fiction of the mind, and
can be nothing, whilst God, to
most men at least, is a living reality,
to be believed in, hoped in, loved.
Were it possible for us to accept
the doctrines of Stuart Mill, we
should feel the same interest in his
humanitarian projects that we do in
Mr. Bergh's society for the prevention
of cruelty to animals. We
pity the poor brutes, but we butcher
them and eat them all the same. If
there is nothing but nature and nature's
laws, it is perfectly right that
the few should live for the many,
and that thousands should sweat
and groan to fill the belly of one
animal who is finer and stronger
than those he feeds upon. Neither
the law of gravity, nor that of the
conservation of forces, nor that
which impels bodies along the line
of least resistance, nor that which
causes the fittest&mdash;which means the
strongest&mdash;to survive, can impose
upon us a moral obligation not to
do what we have the strength to
do. These infidels talk of the intellectual
cowardice of those who
believe. Let them first be frank, and
tell us, without circumlocution or
concealment, that there is nothing
but force; that whatever is, must be;
and that nothing is either right or
wrong. If we are permitted to swallow
oysters whole, to butcher oxen
and imprison monkeys in mere wantonness;
and if these are our forefathers,
why may not the strong and
intelligent members of the human
race put the weak and ignorant to
any use they may see fit; or why
may we not imitate the more natural
savage who roasts or boils his man
as his civilized brother would a pig?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_731" id="Page_731">[Pg 731]</a></span></p>

<p>It is easy to make a show of despising
the argument implied in
this question; but, admitting the
atheistic evolutionary hypothesis, it
cannot be answered.</p>

<p>Cannibals hold that it is for the
greatest happiness of the greatest
number that their enemies should
be eaten; and, after all, what is
happiness, in the utilitarian and
animal sense, but an affair of taste,
to a great extent even of imagination?
Have not slave-owners in
all times held that it was for the
greatest good of the greatest number
that slavery should continue to
exist? Or has the greatest-happiness
principle had anything to do
with the abolition of slavery among
the Christian nations or elsewhere?</p>

<p>Men appealed in the name of
right, of justice, of the inborn dignity
of the human soul, of God-given
liberty, and the conscience of
the nations was awakened. They
gave no thought to the idle theories
of brains, from which the heart and
soul had been strained, about a
greatest-happiness principle. What
have atheists ever done but talk,
and mock, and criticise, and seek
their own ease whilst discoursing on
the general good?</p>

<p>Mill takes the greatest care to
record, in more than one place,
that he and his father occasionally
wrote articles for the <cite>Westminster
Review</cite> without receiving pay for
them; thinking it, evidently, worthy
of remark that an atheist should
even write except for money. Here
we may note a vice inherent in
atheism, which proves at once its
untruth and its impotence. It leaves
man without enthusiasm, without
hope, without love, to fall back
upon himself, a wilted, shrunken
thing, to mix with matter, or to vanish
in lifeless, logical formalism. It
has no heroes, no saints, no martyrs,
no confessors. Its advocates
either abandon themselves to lust
and the senses, or, making a divinity
of their own imagined superiority,
worship the ghost they have
conjured up, whilst looking down
upon the rest of mankind as a vulgar
herd still intellectually walking
on four feet. Mill makes no effort
to conceal his contempt for the
mass of mankind; and contempt
does not inspire love, which alone
renders man helpful to man.</p>

<p>The gloom which settled around
the life of John Stuart Mill, when
he once fully realized that, holding
the intellectual opinions which he
held, nothing was worth living for,
and that he was consequently left
without a motive or an object in
life, never really left him. He tells
us, indeed, that the cloud gradually
drew off, and that, though he had
several relapses which lasted many
months, he was never as miserable
as he had been; but it is quite
evident, from the whole tone of this
<cite>Autobiography</cite>, that his disappointed
soul, like the wounded dove,
drew the wings that were intended
to lift it to God close to itself, and,
hopeless, sank into philosophical
despair. Happiness he considered
the sole end of life; and yet he says
that the enjoyments of life, which
alone make it worth having, when
made its principal object, pall upon
us and sicken the heart. "Ask
yourself whether you are happy,
and you cease to be so. The
only chance is to treat, not happiness,
but some end external to
it, as the purpose of life."</p>

<p>In other words, in Mill's philosophy,
the end of life is happiness,
which can be possessed only by
those who persuade themselves that
this is not the end of life. The
doctrine of philosophical necessity,
during the later returns of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_732" id="Page_732">[Pg 732]</a></span>
despondency, weighed upon him
like an incubus: "I felt as if
I was scientifically proved to be
the helpless slave of antecedent
circumstances; as if my character
and that of all others had been
formed for us by agencies beyond
our control, and was wholly out
of our own power. I often said to
myself, What a relief it would be
if I could disbelieve the doctrine of
the formation of character by circumstances!"<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p>He tries to escape from the fatal
web in which his soul hung helpless;
but sophisms and quibbles of
the brain cannot minister to a
mind diseased or pluck sorrow from
the heart.</p>

<p>But the saddest part of Mill's
<cite>Autobiography</cite> is the portion devoted
to the woman whose friendship
he called the honor and chief blessing
of his existence. The picture
which he has drawn of his childhood
is at once painful and ludicrous.</p>

<p>He does not even incidentally
allude to a single fact which would
lead one to suppose that he had a
mother or had ever known a mother's
love.</p>

<p>The father, as described by the
son, was cold, fanatical, morose, almost
inhuman, acting as though he
thought children are born merely
for the purpose of being crammed
with Greek roots and logical formulas.
John Stuart was put at
Greek vocables when only three
years old. His father demanded
of him not only the utmost that he
could do, but much that it was utterly
impossible that he should do.
He was guilty, for instance, of the
incredible folly of making him read
the <cite>Dialogues</cite> of Plato when only
seven years old. He never knew
anything of the freshness or joyousness
of childhood, or what it is to
be "boy eternal." He grew up
without the companionship of children,
blighted and dwarfed by the
abiding presence of the narrow
and unnatural man who nipped the
flower of his life in the bud, and
repressed within him all the sentiments
and aspirations which are
the spontaneous and healthful product
of youth. He was not taught to
delight in sunshine and flowers, and
music and song; but even in his
boyish rambles there strode ever
by his side the analytical machine,
dissecting, destroying, marring
God's work with his lifeless, hopeless
theories. The effect of this
training was, as we have already
seen, that when the boy became a
man, he found himself like a ship on
the ocean without sail or compass,
and there gathered around his life
the settled gloom of despair, which
his philosophical opinions tended
only to deepen.</p>

<p>Without a mother's love, without
a father whom it was possible to
love, without friends of his own
age, without God, dejected, despondent,
hopeless, he met the wife of a
friend of his father, who, from the
manner in which she controlled
her first and second husbands, must
have been a clever woman, and he
became an idolater, giving to her
the adoration which his father had
taught him to withhold from God.
That there is no exaggeration in
this statement every one who will
take the trouble to read the seventh
chapter of Mill's <cite>Autobiography</cite> will
be ready to confess.</p>

<p>He married this woman in 1851,
when he was forty-five and she but
two years younger, and seven years
later her death occurred. Mill
wishes the world to believe that
this woman was the prodigy of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_733" id="Page_733">[Pg 733]</a></span>
XIXth century, surpassing in intellectual
vigor and moral strength all
men and all other women; that to
her he owed all that is best in his
own writings; and that he is but
the interpreter of the wonderful
thoughts of this incomparable woman,
whom others have deemed
merely a commonplace woman's
rights woman.</p>

<p>"Thus prepared," he writes, "it
will easily be believed that when I
came into close intellectual communion
with a person of the most
eminent faculties, whose genius, as
it grew and unfolded itself in
thought, struck out truths far in
advance of me, but in which I
could not, as I had done in those
others, detect any mixture of error,
the greatest part of my mental
growth consisted in the assimilation
of those truths; and the most valuable
part of my intellectual work
was in building the bridges and
clearing the paths which connected
them with my general system of
thought."<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>Mill seems to have been incapable
of a healthful sentiment of any
kind. The same quality in his
stunted and warped moral nature
which caused him to have a false
and exaggerated sense of the evil
that is in the world, leading him to
atheism, made him a blind and
superstitious worshipper of the imaginary
endowments of his wife.
But one must read the book itself
to realize how far he carried this
idolatry.</p>

<p>When she dies, he again sinks
into the gloom which his superstition
had seemed to cause him partially
to forget; and if he continues
to work, it is only with the feeble
strength "derived from thoughts of
her and communion with her memory."
Her death was a calamity
which took from him all hope, and
he found some slight alleviation
only in the mode of life which best
enabled him to feel her still near
him.</p>

<p>She died at Avignon, and he
bought a cottage as close as possible
to the place where she was buried;
and there he settled down in
helpless misery, feeling that all that
remained to him in the world was
a memory.</p>

<p>"Her memory," he writes, "is to
me a religion, and her approbation
the standard by which, summing up,
as it does, all worthiness, I endeavor
to regulate my life."<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>He did not believe in God, in the
soul, in a life beyond life; he had
scarcely any faith in the practical
efforts of the age to improve the
condition of the masses, upon whom
he looked as the common herd;
his own countrymen especially he
despised as selfish and narrow
above all other men, grovelling in
their instincts, and low in the objects
which they aim at; happiness
he held to be the sole end of existence;
and at the close of his life, an
old man, in a foreign land, in immedicable
misery, he stood beside
a grave, and sought with feeble fingers
to clutch the shadow of a
dream, which he called his religion;
and so he died.</p>

<p>We have never read a sadder
book, nor one which to our mind
contains stronger proof that the
soul longs with an infinite craving
for God, and, not finding him, will
worship anything&mdash;a woman, a
stone, a memory.</p>

<h3>THE FARM OF MUICERON.</h3>


<p class="center">BY MARIE RHEIL.</p>

<p class="center">FROM THE REVUE DU MONDE CATHOLIQUE.
</p>


<h4>XVI.</h4>

<p>However, our good friends at
Muiceron had not become, believe
me, so entirely perverted by vanity
as to lose all remembrance of the
past. They could not have lived
twenty years with a boy as perfect
in conduct and affection as Jean-Louis
without missing him as the
days rolled on.</p>

<p>I acknowledge, nevertheless, that
the first week passed so quickly in
the midst of the flurry and fuss of
the marriage contract and presents&mdash;bought
on credit&mdash;that the absence
of the good child was scarcely
felt; but, towards the end of the
second week, one evening Pierrette
asked Ragaud if the time had not
nearly expired that Jean-Louis had
been lent to Michou for the clearing
of the forest of Montreux; "for,"
said she, "I cannot live any longer
without him, he was of so much use
to me, and the house is so empty
without him."</p>

<p>"I gave him for a fortnight," replied
Ragaud, "and I would not
disoblige Michou by reclaiming him
before; but I think we will see him
next week, and then I hope he will
be over his little miff."</p>

<p>"What miff?" asked Pierrette.</p>

<p>"Bless me! wife, you are a little
too simple if you have not noticed
long before this how sullen the boy
has become."</p>

<p>"He never says much," replied
Pierrette, "and we have all been so
very busy lately, it has made him
more silent even than usual."</p>

<p>"That is precisely it," said Ragaud.
"You have petted him so
much, he fancied everything was his;
and when he saw us so occupied
with Jeannette's marriage, he took it
in dudgeon, and became offended."</p>

<p>"That would be very wrong in
him," replied La Ragaude, "and I
don't believe Jeannet capable of
such wicked sentiments. Jealousy
is not one of his faults; on the contrary,
he always thinks of others
before himself."</p>

<p>"That may be, that may be, but
you cannot judge of wine, no matter
how old you may know it to be,
before tasting; and, in the same
way, you cannot answer for any
quality of the heart until it has been
tried. So it was very easy for
Jeannet not to be jealous when
there was no subject for jealousy;
but, if you were not always blind
and deaf to his defects, you would
acknowledge that from the day that
Isidore put his foot in this house he
has changed as much as milk turned
into curds."</p>

<p>"That may all be," said Pierrette,
who could not answer her husband's
objections.</p>

<p>"That may all be so easily that it
is positively so," replied Ragaud,
"and Jeannet will not re-enter this
house until I have spoken very
plainly to him, and made him promise
to treat Isidore as a brother."</p>

<p>"That is just what I think," replied
good Pierrette, who loved
peace above all things, "and you
always speak wisely."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_735" id="Page_735">[Pg 735]</a></span></p>

<p>Jeannette, for her part, had a
little secret annoyance that she
carefully concealed, but which made
her more irritable and less docile
than usual, greatly to the astonishment
of Pierrette, who thought her
to be at the summit of happiness.
After being rather sullen with Jeannet,
because he did not appear delighted
with her marriage, and,
above all, with her intended, she
was now displeased to see Isidore
parading before every one&mdash;and to
her the first&mdash;his great satisfaction
at the departure of Jean-Louis. He
even seemed to seek every occasion
to speak injuriously of him before
her parents, and allowed no one to
praise him in his presence. The
child was not very patient, we already
know, and, as Solange truly
said, her head alone was dazzled;
her heart was not spoiled enough to
make her lose her good sense. Still
further, she began to feel very uneasy
on a subject which she wished
to understand clearly before finally
engaging herself&mdash;it was that of religion.
She had felt the ground
around Perdreau, and, although he
was as hypocritical as the devil, he
had attempted several very disagreeable
jokes about the church
and her ceremonies which, I must
say, provoked Jeannette to such
a degree, she openly showed her
displeasure. Thereupon Isidore,
seeing that he had gone too far,
and that he must be more careful
or he would lose her dowry, tried
to play the part of a saint in his
niche; but it was a comedy in which
he was not well skilled from want
of practice, and Jeannette, more
and more worried and unhappy,
commenced to regret that the good
and wise Jeannet was no longer at
her side to aid her with his advice,
of which she had never before felt
such urgent need.</p>

<p>So she, in her turn, hazarded the
same request as Pierrette, and asked
her father when they might expect
the return of Jean-Louis.</p>

<p>Ragaud made her nearly the same
reply as he had done to his wife,
without mentioning his ideas in relation
to Jeannet's supposed jealousy;
and Jeannette patiently awaited
him.</p>

<p>But the fortnight went by without
any sign of the boy, and it
could be easily perceived that
Jeannette was becoming nervous&mdash;a
kind of sickness little known in the
country even by name, but which
mademoiselle's example had taught
Jeannette to attempt whenever
things did not go on exactly as she
wished. However, affairs went on
precisely as those rascally Perdreaux
desired. The marriage-contract
was prepared, and, after
an immense scrawl of big words,
which Ragaud did not understand,
it concluded by making the good
man abandon all his personal and
landed property to his daughter,
only reserving for himself a moderate
annuity. Ragaud was ashamed
to avow that all this waste paper
was entirely above his comprehension.
He tried to look very wise, but
proved by his questions that he
was caught in a trap; for, after the
reading of the knavish document,
which stripped him of everything,
he innocently asked if he would retain
the right to manage Muiceron,
and live there as master during his
life.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," replied the notary;
"your children would be unnatural
to let it be otherwise. I
have done all for the best, for I
suppose you do not wish to oblige
my son to marry under the <em>dotal
law</em>?"</p>

<p>"What is the <em>dotal law</em>?" said
Ragaud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_736" id="Page_736">[Pg 736]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is the greatest disgrace that
can be imposed on a man," gravely
replied the notary.</p>

<p>"Oh! I beg pardon, M. Perdreau;
and so in your paper there
is no question of that?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said the notary.
"I have drawn up the papers for
the good father and honorable man
that you are."</p>

<p>"Then it is all right, and I have
nothing more to do but to thank
you," said the honest farmer.</p>

<p>"We could both sign it this
evening," said the head rascal.</p>

<p>"There is no hurry," said Ragaud;
"we will do that when all
the family are present, before my
wife and the children. I wish
Jeannet to sign it also."</p>

<p>"Sign? Your Jean-Louis can't
sign it," said the notary, "as he has
no name; the law, M. Ragaud, does
not recognize illegitimate children."</p>

<p>"Really! That is cruel for the
boy, monsieur; at least, I would
like him to hear the paper read."</p>

<p>"For what reason?"</p>

<p>"To please him, that is all; he
has been like a child to us for
twenty years, and has never deserved
to be driven from the family."</p>

<p>"As you please; I think it useless.
In business, you see, there
is no such thing as sentiment; however,
if you prefer it...."</p>

<p>"I certainly do prefer it," replied
Ragaud firmly. "I have been a just
man all my life, monsieur, and I do
not wish now to act unjustly toward
a child who has always served
me so faithfully."</p>

<p>The notary did not reply, but his
ugly weasel-face showed such bitter
displeasure that Ragaud, already
dissatisfied with the conversation,
suddenly remembered Jacques Michou's
remarks, and promised himself
to keep his eyes open.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the good God gives
to honest men a sense of distrust
which is easily sharpened. The
peasant, in particular, is never entirely
at ease when spoken to in
more difficult language than two
and two make four. Now, Ragaud,
on account of his vanity, did
not wish to acknowledge before
others that he understood nothing
of all the fine writing on the stamped
paper, but he avowed it to himself,
and, putting on a perfectly innocent
air, he said to Perdreau:</p>

<p>"Will you have the kindness to
let me have the papers for a few
days? I would like to read them
over again when I have time."</p>

<p>"Very willingly," replied the notary,
well convinced&mdash;and there he
was right&mdash;that good Ragaud could
not decipher the handwriting, and
that it would be all Greek to him.
"I was even going to propose it to
you. Take them, M. Ragaud, and
read them at your leisure; but
I need not tell you that it must remain
a secret between us until the
day the contract is signed."</p>

<p>"I understand," replied Ragaud.
"I know how to be discreet, monsieur,
and I am not more desirous
than you that my daughter's affairs
should be known all over the neighborhood."</p>

<p>He did not speak falsely in promising
it; for to a Christian the
word of a priest is sacred, and he
only intended to let the <i lang="fr">curé</i> read
the contract under the seal of confession.</p>

<p>The next day it so happened
that M. Perdreau went to the city,
where he expected to pass two days,
to plan an affair still worse than the
rest, which you will know in due
time. Ragaud, thus having the
field clear, hurried off to Val-Saint,
with the papers carefully folded
under his blouse.</p>

<p>That morning Jeannette was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_737" id="Page_737">[Pg 737]</a></span>
in good humor. Three weeks had
gone by without any news of Jeannet,
who did not even return to
sleep at Muiceron. She received
her loving Isidore like a spoiled
child, shrugged her shoulders when
he told her she was charmingly
pretty, and ended by telling him
he must find out something about
Jean-Louis, and bring him back to
her as quickly as possible, or else
she would not believe he loved her.</p>

<p>Isidore, who had every defect&mdash;above
all, the silly vanity to think
that he was fully capable of turning
the heads of all the girls, which is,
in itself, a proof of presumptuous
folly&mdash;pretended at first to take it as
a joke, imagining that Jeannette
wished to provoke his jealousy.
But seeing her serious and resolute,
he replied in an angry tone that
such a commission was not to his
taste.</p>

<p>"In that case," she replied, "it
is not to mine to talk to you to-day."</p>

<p>"Then I will take my leave,"
said he, touching his hat.</p>

<p>She did not detain him, and
contented herself with smiling,
which he thought another little
coquettish trick.</p>

<p>"You are like all women," said
he slowly, "who do not mind sacrificing
their hearts for a whim."</p>

<p>"What do you call a whim?"
replied Jeannette. "Is the desire
to see my brother again a whim?
Very well, then, I declare to you
that I will regard nothing decided
as to our marriage until Jean-Louis
has returned home."</p>

<p>"Do you think, my little beauty,"
said he, turning red with anger,
"that I will let you call that vagabond
of a foundling brother after
you become my wife?"</p>

<p>"We will see," replied she; "but,
meanwhile, I do not intend to
change, and neither will I allow
Jeannet to be insulted in my presence;
it is not the first time I have
told you so, M. Isidore."</p>

<p>"And so you are capable of becoming
seriously angry with me,
who adores you, on account of your
pretended brother?"</p>

<p>"If you are unreasonable and
unjust," said she resolutely, "I
will no longer love you."</p>

<p>"You scarcely love me now,"
said he sullenly. "I did not believe
that the day would ever come when
you could think so little of me."</p>

<p>"I have always thought," she
replied, "that husband and wife
should agree upon all points. Ever
since I can remember, I have always
had a respect and friendship
for Jean-Louis, and never has he
behaved otherwise than well in
this house, where he is looked upon
as a son. I don't know why my
marriage should change my feelings
in regard to him; and that is a question
I confess we had better settle
at once before going any further.</p>

<p>"Very well," said M. Isidore,
speaking like one who had suddenly
decided upon some plan. "I am
very sorry to be obliged to pain
you, but I will not bother myself
about this bast&mdash;about this Jean-Louis,
and that because it is time
you should know the truth about
him; he is far from being worthy
of your esteem, my dear Jeanne."</p>

<p>"Oh! indeed!" said she. "Here
is something very new; and the
proof, if you please?"</p>

<p>"You insist upon knowing it?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely and quickly," replied
Jeannette, who began to grow
impatient.</p>

<p>"You will certainly be grieved,
and there is reason for it," said Isidore
in a sad tone. "Know, then,
that this Jean-Louis, whom you
fancy dying with grief because he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_738" id="Page_738">[Pg 738]</a></span>
no longer sees you, is all the while
enjoying himself immensely."</p>

<p>"How can he amuse himself?"
asked Jeannette. "You are telling
stories. Jeannet is in the wood of
Montreux, where he has too much
to do, in clearing out the forest, to
think of anything else; besides,
he is not naturally very gay, poor
boy!"</p>

<p>"<em>Poor boy!</em> Don't pity him so
much; he would laugh if he heard
you. Clearing the wood of Montreux&mdash;he?
It is a mere pretence
to hide his game; he wishes to be
more at ease to court Solange Luguet.</p>

<p>"M. Isidore," cried Jeannette,
starting up, pale with anger, "keep
on speaking ill of Jean-Louis&mdash;he is
a man, and can defend himself; but
to speak thus of my cousin Solange
is a cowardly falsehood!"</p>

<p>"How pretty you look!" said
Isidore insolently. "Anger is so becoming
to you, I would always like
to see you so, if it were not so painful
to me to excite you thus. No,
Jeanne, I do not lie. M. Jean-Louis,
who owes his life to your
parents, and whom you call brother,
at this very instant ridicules the
whole household. He is going to
marry Solange, and I don't believe
he will even inform you of it."</p>

<p>"Who told you so?" asked Jeannette,
amazed. "People will gossip
so."</p>

<p>"I had it from Pierre Luguet.
It is true it is common talk, but I
would not have believed it, if Solange's
own brother had not said
it."</p>

<p>"Can you swear it to me?" said
she.</p>

<p>"I can swear to it positively.
Ask Pierre; you see I am not afraid
of being proved a liar."</p>

<p>"I believe you," said Jeanne,
who sought in vain to keep back
the tears that filled her eyes.
"Never, I confess, would I have believed
that of Jean-Louis."</p>

<p>"You understand now why I
did not care to start in search of
that gentleman. I am indignant at
his conduct; it is frightful ingratitude.
To think that he had here
a father, a mother, a sister, and
that he abandons all to go off and
be secretly married! Is it not
proof in itself that he renounces
and despises you?"</p>

<p>"Oh! it is very wrong, very
wrong!" said Jeannette, much excited.
"You were right&mdash;I can
no longer call him brother."</p>

<p>"I hope not; it would be affection
very badly bestowed, and
which would make you the laughing-stock
of the village. Are you
still angry with me, my dear Jeanne?"</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said she, extending
her hand; "you see, I have
had good reason for sorrow."</p>

<p>And then she burst into tears,
no longer able to restrain them, but
without exactly knowing the cause
of so real a pain.</p>

<p>Isidore did not expect to succeed
so well. This time he had
not lied; he really believed Jeannet
would be married, as that giddy-brained
Pierre had announced the
fact to him. And yet he did not
like to see Jeanne weep for such a
little thing. It made him think
that the affection of these two children,
who had lived together as
brother and sister for so many
years, was much stronger than he
had believed, and he was more determined
than ever to put a stop to
it after he was married, and even
before, if he could.</p>

<p>He left Muiceron very much dissatisfied.
Jeannette was sad; she
let him go off without scarcely noticing
him. When she was alone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_739" id="Page_739">[Pg 739]</a></span>
the wish to seek some consolation
led her to go after her mother, to
see if she had heard the news, and
to talk with her about it.</p>

<p>But, behold! just as she left the
room she ran against some one,
and who should it be but Jean-Louis,
who had come after some
changes of clothes to carry off to
the wood, and who, knowing that
she was with her intended, did not
wish to disturb her.</p>

<p>At the sight of her brother all the
readiness of her character came back
and took the place of her vexation.
She assumed an air so haughty
that Jeannet, all ready to embrace
her, stepped back, dumb with astonishment.</p>

<p>"<em>You there?</em>" said Jeannette,
with a frown on her brow.</p>

<p>"You there? Why do you speak
so to me?" asked he, astonished.</p>

<p>"You must not forget," continued
Jeanne, who proudly raised her
head as she spoke, "that I am engaged
to Isidore Perdreau."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it," said Jean-Louis.</p>

<p>"Consequently," she replied, "it
is no longer possible for me to
treat you as formerly. You know
why?"</p>

<p>"I know it," answered he, lowering
his head.</p>

<p>"It is no longer proper," said
she, "for us to behave as brother
and sister, since we are not so really."</p>

<p>"That is true," said Jeannet, his
heart aching with mortal agony.</p>

<p>"That is all I have to say," added
Jeannette in a still haughtier
tone; "and now, Jean-Louis, I wish
you much joy and happiness&mdash;this
I say in remembrance of our friendship!"</p>

<p>"Are you bidding me farewell?"
asked he.</p>

<p>"I will see you later&mdash;and&mdash;and
your wife also; but you understand?"</p>

<p>"My wife?" said Jeannet.</p>

<p>"Enough," replied Jeanne; "I
do not wish to know your secrets.
It is useless for you to seek my
father and my mother."</p>

<p>And with that she rapidly crossed
the room, and hurried off; for,
between ourselves, this great anger
was not very real, and the longer
she looked at the pale, beautiful
face of her brother, whom she had
not seen for such a long time, the
more she felt like throwing her
arms around his neck, instead of
ill-treating him. But her words
had been too cruel; they had entered
the soul of Jean-Louis like so
many sword-thrusts. It was all
ended for him. Proud as he was,
and always overwhelmed with the
secret grief of his birth, to have
it recalled to him by so dear a
mouth was deadly suffering. He
remained an instant as though his
senses had left him, not knowing
what to do or to think; then all at
once his reason returned. He had
just been driven out, and, after all,
they had the right to do it. He
made the sign of the cross on his
heart, and left the house, with the
intention of never returning.</p>

<p>He went back to Michou, and
passed the evening with him at the
Luguets'. He said nothing of what
had happened to any one. Dear,
good Solange noticed that he was
sadder than usual, but that was not
astonishing; she knew he had been
that day to Muiceron, and she very
truly thought he had possibly heard
things which could not contribute
to lighten his heart and make him
gay.</p>

<p>It is now time to tell you that
old Perdreau was one of the leaders
of a band of ruffians who assembled
in a lonely field every week in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_740" id="Page_740">[Pg 740]</a></span>
city of Issoudun, where, after taking
the most frightful oaths, they plotted,
murder, arson, and the robbery
of the châteaux and churches.
It was what is called a secret society,
and was known by the name of
<i lang="fr">la Martine</i>; and some weeks afterwards,
when the Revolution of 1848
broke out, which caused such
havoc among us, there was a well-known
man, so I have been told,
who bore the same name, and who
placed himself at the head of the
insurgents, believing them, in good
faith, to be the most honest men in
the world. This man, who was as
good as any one you could find,
and even a passable Christian, my
father assured me, bit his thumbs
until the blood came when he saw
himself despised and his counsel
disregarded. But it was too late;
the evil was done. Undoubtedly
you know much more about it than
I, and so I scarcely dare venture
to say any more on the subject.
You must only know that the cursed
notary had used all the money
of M. le Marquis to pay the rabble
of <i lang="fr">la Martine</i>, with the understanding
that, when they pillaged the
château, he should have half the
estate, including the dwelling-house.</p>

<p>As for Isidore, he was fully up to
the business, and worked at it assiduously,
as much at Paris as elsewhere.
The men who worked in
the wood of Montreux belonged to
the gang; he knew them all by
name, and kept them all near Val-Saint,
so as to be ready for the contemplated
insurrection. But in
case the thing should not succeed,
or would be delayed, he did not
think it beneath him to provide
himself with a pear to satisfy his
thirst, and that was his marriage.</p>

<p>Our good Ragaud returned from
his interview with M. le Curé rather
depressed in spirits. The contract,
as read by the holy man, did not
appear to him as captivating as
when explained by the notary. He
had learned still further, from a few
words discreetly uttered, that it
would be well not to place implicit
faith in Master Perdreau, and believe
him the personification of
honor, as until then he had innocently
imagined. What now could
be done to arrange, or rather disarrange,
affairs so far advanced? The
poor man was devoured with care
and anxiety. He dared not speak
to his daughter, whom he thought
to reduce to desperation at the
mere mention of the word rupture;
and then to withdraw from the contract
now would lower him tremendously
in the eyes of the world
around. No longer able to see clearly,
Ragaud kept quiet, locked the
documents safely in his chest, and
waited&mdash;which, in many circumstances,
is the wisest policy.</p>

<p>A long week passed; then came
the festivals of Christmas and New
Year. Old Perdreau was half dead
with impatience, but nevertheless
dared not say a word, or even appear
too anxious. What bothered
him, besides, was that the rascally
gang in the wood of Montreux
were constantly receiving messages
from their infernal society to hurry
up affairs, and, therefore, they
threatened to commence the dance
before the violins were ready,
which would have spoiled all the
plans. Pushed to extremity, he
determined, one fine day, to send
his son secretly to allay the storm
by speaking to his worthy companions
in roguery.</p>

<p>Isidore, who feared nothing and
no one, ridiculed his father's anxiety.
He promised to quiet them
that very night, and about eleven
o'clock, in spite of the bad weather&mdash;for
it was snowing, and the wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_741" id="Page_741">[Pg 741]</a></span>
was very high&mdash;he left for Val-Saint.</p>

<p>The place they were clearing was
quite far from M. Michou's little
house, where Jean-Louis slept, together
with the game-keeper. The
men, as is customary among wood-cutters,
had constructed a large retreat
formed of the trunks of trees,
cemented with mud and moss. It
was towards this spot that young
Perdreau directed his steps; and
never did a stormier night fall upon
an uglier traveller.</p>


<h4>XVII.</h4>

<p>It is not difficult to conjecture
that Jeannet, in spite of his heart-troubles
and sorrows, had not been&mdash;sharp
as he was&mdash;blind to the
character of the men who worked
under his orders in the wood of
Montreux. In the first place, Michou
warned him from the beginning
to be watchful, and not to allow
the slightest infringement of
discipline or drunkenness among
men, who were unknown and of decidedly
doubtful appearance. One
warning sufficed; he observed for
himself, and caught at random more
than one stray expression which he
chanced to overhear. And then,
what could be expected from men
who seemed to be without family or
friends, who never frequented the
church, and shunned the places
where the honest people of the
commune were accustomed to assemble?
Certainly, our good Jean-Louis
was not wanting in penetration,
and old Michou, who prided
himself upon seeing very far into
everything, was as distrustful as
he; consequently, they agreed that
every night one or the other should
take a turn around the retreat of
the wood-cutters, and see what was
going on in this nest of mischievous
rascals. To do this, Jeannet
had skilfully managed to make an
opening in the angle opposite to
that where the men had established
their fireplace, so that, the room
being well lighted inside, everything
could be clearly seen outside.</p>

<p>Usually, and for many nights, all
was quiet and orderly; the greater
part of the band of <i lang="fr">la Martine</i>,
tired out with the day's labors,
slept soundly all the evening,
stretched pell-mell upon heaps of
dried leaves strewed over the floor
of their bivouac. Only a few remained
drinking by the hearth; so
that the watchers, after a glance
around, went off to sleep in their
turn.</p>

<p>On the night of which I speak,
Michou should have made the
round, but Jean-Louis, who since
the scene at Muiceron had been
miserably unhappy, and could not
sleep, asked leave to fulfil the extra
duty.</p>

<p>"It is very stormy," said he to his
old comrade. "Remain at home,
M. Jacques; I will go to Montreux
in your place."</p>

<p>"Be off, then," said the keeper,
without waiting to be asked twice,
"you are young and not rheumatic;
and I will smoke my pipe while
waiting for you."</p>

<p>Jeannet threw over his shoulders
a heavy brown wrapper, and was
off in a flash.</p>

<p>When he reached the retreat, he
was surprised to see light shining
through the two or three little windows
under the roof, and a big
column of smoke coming out of the
chimney. Just at this moment Isidore
entered from his side; he
made them open the door, by
means of a signal well known
among men of that stamp; they received
him with much honor, and
rekindled the fire, which was burning
rather low.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_742" id="Page_742">[Pg 742]</a></span></p>

<p>Jeannet looked through the opening;
judge of his astonishment
when he recognized Jeannette's intended,
and saw the cordial welcome
extended to him by the men,
who grasped him by the hand, and
made room for him among them.
He was dumfounded, almost fancied
himself in a dream, but, at the
same time, shook with anger, shame,
and sorrow.</p>

<p>But this was only the beginning
of his surprise. If the inside could
easily be seen, the conversation
was as plainly heard through the
wooden walls, lined with moss; and
what he heard froze the blood in
his veins. Isidore first spoke, and
made an eloquent discourse, which
was several times interrupted by
the bravos of his audience; in
which speech he showed precisely
what he was&mdash;a pagan, an agrarian,
a complete villain, without either
faith or justice. He encouraged
his friends, the ruffianly crew before
him, to proceed to arson and pillage&mdash;to
murder, if necessary&mdash;for the
one purpose, said he, of gaining the
triumph of the <em>holy cause</em>. This
word <em>holy</em>, which he did not scruple
to repeat, sounded so horribly in
his blasphemous mouth that poor
Jean-Louis shuddered while listening
to him; not from fear, but from
the furious desire to avenge the
name of holy, which he had dared
to pollute with his tongue.</p>

<p>"O my God!" thought he;
"that the husband of Jeannette!
And is it on account of such
a vagabond that I have been
treated so harshly? Poor, poor
Jeanne!"</p>

<p>After Isidore had finished his
frightful speech, his companions
began to curse and swear all at
once. Glasses of brandy were
passed around, and their heads, already
heated by wicked passions,
became still more excited; so
that they began to dispute among
themselves as to whom should belong
this and that piece of the
estate of Val-Saint. This one
wanted the fields, another the wood,
a third such or such a farm, and so
on with the rest, until Isidore, commanding
silence, reminded them,
with threats and oaths, that the
château should belong to his father,
and that whoever failed to comply
with his promise would be answerable
to him personally.</p>

<p>"Come, come," said one of the
men, "we will see a little about
that; he is going rather too far. Is
it because he is going to marry a
devotee&mdash;eh, Isidore?"</p>

<p>Perdreau turned livid with anger
at being thus addressed&mdash;not that
he respected Jeannette or her principles,
but because he was as proud
as a peacock; and as he held every
one around him in sovereign contempt,
he did not recognize their
right to meddle in his private affairs.</p>

<p>"I will marry whom I please,"
said he haughtily; "and the first
one that finds fault has only to
speak."</p>

<p>"Bah! bah! Isidore, don't be
angry," said an old wood-cutter,
who went by the name of <em>Blackbeard</em>,
on account of his savage look.
"What they say is only for your
good; we have heard tell of your
marriage, and it alarms us. The
truth is that if the thing is true,
you will be tied for ever to that Ragaud,
who belongs to the sacristy
clique."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" replied Isidore, somewhat
pacified; "the moment you
talk sense, I am willing to answer.
Tell me, then, what would you do
if a chestful of gold came under
your hand?"</p>

<p>"What nonsense even to ask such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_743" id="Page_743">[Pg 743]</a></span>
a question! Why, I would pick it
up, of course."</p>

<p>"That is just what I am doing,"
replied Isidore, laughing; "and as
for the piety and all that stuff, I
don't bother myself. When I will
have the principal, I am capable of
regulating the rest."</p>

<p>"Do it, and joy be with you,"
said Blackbeard; "we understand
each other. So no one will be allowed
to interfere with Isidore; he
is worthy of our esteem!"</p>

<p>The rascals applauded, and recommenced
their shameful jokes
and infernal proposals. Isidore,
once more master of the assembly,
spoke at greater length, and ended
by exacting an oath that no one
should move in the cause until a
given signal from Paris. They all
swore as he wished, and, as the
night was far advanced, honest Perdreau
took leave of his good friends,
fearing that daylight might surprise
him before he could regain
his house.</p>

<p>Jean-Louis needed all the
strength mercifully granted by the
good God in such a trying moment
to listen until the end to all these
horrors. The blood boiled in his
veins; he felt neither the snow,
nor the biting north wind, and
more than once his indignation was
so great, he stepped forward and
clenched his fist, as though he would
throw himself in the midst of those
demons, without reflecting that a
solid wall separated them from him.
Happily, he restrained himself; for
courage is not imprudence, and, if
he had failed in coolness, he would
have lost all the results of the important
discovery he had just made.
He went back to Michou's cabin,
whom he found awaiting his return,
according to his promise, and who
had commenced to feel very anxious
about his long absence.</p>

<p>"M. Jacques," said he, on entering,
"I came very near not returning...."</p>

<p>And in a few words he recounted
all he had heard and seen.</p>

<p>Michou said not a word. He relighted
his pipe, and paced the floor,
plunged in thought.</p>

<p>"I knew the Perdreaux were famous
scamps," said he at last, "but
not quite so bad as that!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Jeannet, "if my
death could have saved Jeannette
from that rascal, I would have
broken in the door and fallen in
the midst of them without hesitation."</p>

<p>"A very stupid thing you would
have done, then," replied Michou;
"they would have killed you, and
to-morrow announced that you had
fallen from a tree. That would
have been a lucky thing for Perdreau."</p>

<p>"God watched over me," replied
Jean-Louis. "And now, what shall
we do?"</p>

<p>"That little Ragaud," said Michou,
"deserves it all for her frivolity
and vanity; and, as a punishment,
we should let her go to
the end of the rope with her Isidore."</p>

<p>"Never, never!" cried Jean-Louis.
"You are not speaking seriously?
The daughter of your old
brother-in-arms?"</p>

<p>"Ha!" replied the old fellow,
"my old brother-in-arms! Ten
years ago I predicted what would
be the end of his nonsense."</p>

<p>"This is not the time to wish it
now," replied Jeannet. "Let us
save them, M. Michou; I can do
nothing without you."</p>

<p>"Why not? You have a tongue
like me; more than that, you saw
and heard all; go to-morrow to
Muiceron."</p>

<p>"Impossible," said Jeannet, much
embarrassed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_744" id="Page_744">[Pg 744]</a></span></p>

<p>"Impossible? There is something
behind that!"</p>

<p>"But was it not you yourself
who made me promise not to return
to my parents?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly, my child; but
the case is urgent, it seems to me,
and they should know in time, so
as to change their minds before it
is too late."</p>

<p>"I will lose my self-control if I
meet Isidore face to face."</p>

<p>"Jeannet," said Michou, "you
have a good heart. I know all, my
boy; they drove you from Muiceron.
Marion heard that little
magpie of a Jeannette dismiss you,
and she related the story to me,
weeping all the while, good fat girl
that she is. I wished to see how
far your generosity would carry
you. Evil be to them who treated
you in that manner; they deserve
what has happened."</p>

<p>"No," said Jean-Louis, "they
are blinded, that is all; and now I
have forgotten those words, said
without reflection. M. Jacques, I
beg of you help me to save Jeannette."</p>

<p>"You will have a fine reward,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Oh! what is it to me? After
all, can I, for a few cruel words,
lose the memory of twenty years of
tenderness and kindness?"</p>

<p>"If you do not have your place
in heaven," said the keeper, raising
his shoulders and voice at the same
time, to conceal his emotion, which
was very visible, "I think our <i lang="fr">curé</i>
himself cannot answer for his.
Come, let us see what we can do to
save this hare-brained Jeannette.
In the first place, to-morrow, at the
latest, I intend that M. le Marquis'
place shall be cleared of those
rascals that encumber it. The
thing is easy; I will tell them that,
owing to the bad weather, we will
postpone the clearing of the forest
until spring, as the work advances
too slowly, and give them two
weeks' pay ... no, I won't; one
week is enough. And then you&mdash;you
must write; do you hear?
<em>Write.</em> Writing remains, and scenes
and conflicts are avoided; you will
therefore write six lines, carefully
worded, to Perdreau. You will tell
him you were at the meeting in the
wood that night. How? That is
none of his business&mdash;it is enough
that you were there; then you will
add: 'I give you three days to
disappear, after which I will warn
the police.' And for the explanation
at Muiceron, I will see to
it."</p>

<p>Jean-Louis saw at once the good
sense of this arrangement, and
obeyed immediately. In reality, it
was the only means of bringing
things to the best possible conclusion.</p>

<p>The next day Michou went to
the wood, as usual. He found the
men at their work, as though nothing
had happened, and taking aside
old Blackbeard, who appeared to
have some control over his companions,
he told him very quietly of
his intention. Now, you will have
no difficulty in seeing that for men
who reckoned upon dividing a domain
worth five hundred thousand
crowns in a few days, to be free
from work and receive a week's pay
was a clear and enticing advantage.
Michou was applauded; and, but
that it went against the grain, he
would have had the happiness of
shaking hands with the whole crew.
But as he was not very desirous of
that pleasure with such a set, he
was entirely rewarded for his pains
by seeing them file past him arm-in-arm,
and watched them as they
went down the road, singing at the
top of their lungs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_745" id="Page_745">[Pg 745]</a></span></p>

<p>That same morning Jean-Louis'
letter left for its destination, and
in the evening the letter-carrier deposited
it at the notary's house.</p>

<p>It has been remarked that villains
are not brave. The good God,
who protects honest men because
they scarcely think of defending
themselves, has put cowardice in
the hearts of their enemies, and it
serves as a rampart always raised
before virtue, which prevents the
wicked blows of vice from piercing
it to death. Do not be astonished
at that beautiful phrase; I acknowledge
I am not capable of inventing
it; but, in order that I might
repeat it to you, I carefully copied
it from a big book, full of wise sayings,
formerly lent to me by the
Dean of Aubiers.</p>

<p>If the lightning had fallen upon
the notary's house, it would not
have produced a greater shock
than Jeannet's simple letter. The
Perdreaux, as they were better
educated than the mass of the poor
people, whom the ringleaders of the
revolution use for their own purpose,
did not doubt but there would
be great trouble and an overthrow
of thrones, but were not the less sure
of the universal division of property,
which they looked forward to
with such eagerness. But the safest
and strongest plank of salvation for
them was the marriage of Isidore,
and it was most important that it
should take place now, or else the
prison-doors would soon be opened.
Old Perdreau was annihilated.
For thirty years he had had the
boldness to calumniate his neighbors
on every occasion; he was on
the eve, if he could, of causing the
ruin, and perhaps the death, of our
good lord by delivering up his property
and betraying his secrets;
but before this paper, which contained
only a few lines without
threats or anger, written by a foundling,
he turned livid and trembled
with fright, and his ugly face, ordinarily
so bold, was covered with a
cold sweat. Isidore also was as
pale as he; from time to time he
read Jean-Louis' letter, crushed it
in his hand, trampled it under foot,
swore by the holy name of the Lord,
and struck the tables and chairs
with his clenched fist. But that
did not help the matter. The father
and son dared not speak to
each other. At last Isidore took
the paper up again; and as if that
scare-crow, by disappearing, could
mend affairs, he tore it into a thousand
pieces.</p>

<p>"We are lost, lost!" repeated old
Perdreau, clutching his gray hair
with both his hands.</p>

<p>"That remains to be seen!" cried
Isidore. "Father, instead of sinking
into such despair, you had better
think of some plan. It was by
your order I went to Montreux. I
knew there was no need of such
hurry."</p>

<p>"What could I do?" asked the
unhappy old man, ready to humiliate
himself before his son. "We
were menaced on all sides."</p>

<p>"It was only you who saw all
that," replied Isidore harshly; "I
always listened to you too much."</p>

<p>"We can deny it all," ventured
Perdreau.</p>

<p>"That is easy to say. But I am
not sure of our men, if they should
be questioned. That cursed foundling
will be believed before all of
us."</p>

<p>"Lost! lost!" repeated the notary,
in the last state of despair.</p>

<p>"We won't give up," said Isidore.
"Go to bed, father; you are in no
condition to talk. I will reflect for
both."</p>

<p>"Ah! think of something, no
matter what; we must avert the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_746" id="Page_746">[Pg 746]</a></span>
blow," said old Perdreau, as he
staggered to his room.</p>

<p>"Avert the blow!" repeated Isidore;
"the devil himself would not
succeed&mdash;unless&mdash;unless...."</p>

<p>He paused, as if some one would
listen to his thought. A frightful
idea entered his head, and all that
night the notary, who groaned and
shivered with fever in his bed,
heard him walking about, taking
great strides across the floor, whilst
he uttered disconnected words.</p>

<p>The next day the servant found
her masters in a sad state; one
sick, almost delirious, the other
asleep, all dressed, in a chair, with a
face haggard from the effects of the
terrible night that had just passed.</p>

<p>But two hours afterwards, affairs
resumed their accustomed train.
Isidore bathed and changed his
clothes, drank a bowl of hot wine,
in which he poured a good pint of
brandy. He swallowed this comforter,
ate a mouthful, and appeared
fresh and well. But an experienced
person would easily have seen that
his eyes looked like balls of fire
under the red lids, and that every
moment he made a singular movement
with his shoulders; you would
have thought he shuddered, but
doubtless that was owing to the
heavy frost the night before.</p>

<p>He went to see Jeannette, as usual,
and was wonderfully polite; the
little thing was sad, but gentle and
quiet. She willingly spoke of the
marriage, of the contemplated journey,
and the presents she wished.
But yet it was easy to see that
each one of the betrothed was
playing a part in trying to appear
at ease, and scarcely succeeded.
Jeannette, in the midst of a fine
phrase, would stop and look out
of the window, and Isidore would
profit by the opportunity to fall
into a reverie, which certainly was
not suitable at such a time. The
reason was that the slight friendship
that was felt on one side
had taken wings and flown away;
whilst on the other that which
perhaps might begin threatened
to be cut short by circumstances:
but whose fault was it?</p>

<p>"As you make your bed, so you
must lie," said our <i lang="fr">curé</i>, and Isidore,
who had stuffed his with
thorns, should not have been surprised
if he felt them. No one
can describe, because, very fortunately,
no one can understand, the
disordered state of this unhappy
young man's mind. He had formed
a resolution whose result you
will soon see; and on whatever side
he looked, he saw a bottomless
abyss open before his eyes. He
was afraid&mdash;this yet can be said in
his favor, for indifference to crime
is the state of finished scoundrels&mdash;and
he would not now have gone
so far, if, as we hope, he had not
previously lost his senses.</p>

<p>He prolonged his visit to Muiceron
as long as he could. Little
Jeannette was tired out and did not
attempt to conceal it, which sufficiently
showed how much pleasure
she took in the presence of her
future husband. She even yawned
two or three times, which any other
day he would have resented; but
now it escaped his notice.</p>

<p>At nightfall he at last decided
to leave, and then it could be seen,
by his pallor and the manner that
he passed his hand across his brow,
that the great deep pit of which I
spoke caused him a greater vertigo
than ever.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he started resolutely
on the road for the wood of
Montreux, and, when he was near
the wood-cutters' retreat, he looked
as if he wished to enter it; but suddenly
he retraced his steps, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_747" id="Page_747">[Pg 747]</a></span>
afterwards appeared so absent and
buried in his own reflections, he
did not notice that the cabin was
empty, and no work going on inside.</p>

<p>One man, however, was walking
among the huge piles of timber,
half ready for delivery; it was
Michou. He at once perceived
Isidore, and followed him with his
eyes a long distance; but it was not
necessary to accost him, and he let
him pass on, with the idea that he
was seeking the high-road to Issoudun,
in obedience to the letter of
Jean-Louis.</p>

<p>"The hawk is caught," said he
to himself. "Well, let him go in
peace, that he may receive his last
shot elsewhere."</p>

<p>During this time, Perdreau directed
his steps towards the game-keeper's
house. He easily entered,
as the door was only closed by a
latch; Michou, in his isolated abode
counting more on his gun, which he
always kept loaded at his bedside,
than on the protection of bolts.</p>

<p>Isidore knew that each night
Jeannet came to eat and sleep in
the little house; but he also knew
that he worked until late in the
night, and that there was no risk
of meeting him at this early hour.</p>

<p>As he expected, he found the
idiot Barbette alone in the house.
The poor girl was preparing the
soup Jean-Louis was accustomed
to eat on returning home, and near
her was her dog, who never left
her, not even at night, when both
went out together to sleep with the
sheep.</p>

<p>She knew Isidore, as she had
seen him roaming around the country.
Except to say good-morning
and good-evening, she scarcely
knew how to speak, and therefore
showed neither astonishment nor
fear, as is the case with children
deprived of reason, who are not
conscious either of good or evil.</p>

<p>Isidore sank into a chair without
speaking; Barbette nodded to him,
and continued stirring her stew-pan.</p>

<p>"What are you making there?"
asked Perdreau, after a few moments'
silence.</p>

<p>The idiot burst out laughing, as
though the question was very funny.</p>

<p>"Soup," she replied, still laughing
loudly.</p>

<p>"Is it for your uncle?"</p>

<p>"No, my uncle has dined."</p>

<p>"Who is it for, then?"</p>

<p>"For the other one."</p>

<p>"The other one? Is it for Jean-Louis?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You are very sure?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" said she, laughing
louder than ever.</p>

<p>"Very good," muttered Isidore
between his teeth. He suddenly
arose, and gave the dog a furious
kick.</p>

<p>Barbette uttered a shrill scream.
Her dog was her only friend; she
threw herself between Isidore and
the poor beast, which she clasped
in her arms.</p>

<p>During this movement, which
was very quick, the wretched Perdreau
sprang towards the stove,
threw into the soup a paper of
white powder, which he had kept
hidden in his hand, and disappeared
in a second, like one who feels
his clothes catching fire.</p>

<p>Soon all was again quiet and silent.
Little Barbette understood
nothing, except that the wicked
man who had beaten her dog without
any cause had left, and that she
could return to her cooking. She
recommenced stirring her soup,
laughing softly to herself, but taking
care, however, that her dog was
close to her side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_748" id="Page_748">[Pg 748]</a></span></p>

<p>Michou entered about a quarter
of an hour later. He was fatigued
with his day's work, and thought
no more of Isidore, whom he believed
far away. Besides, if he
had given him a thought, the idea
would never have entered his head
to question Barbette, who was not
in a condition to render an account
of anybody or anything.</p>

<p>The game-keeper had his bed
and Jeannet's also (straw mattresses,
laid on trestles) placed in a recess
at the end of the room, so
that, upon retiring, they could draw
the curtains, and be as private as
though in another room. He undressed
quietly, and stretched himself
upon the bed to take his much-needed
rest, knowing well that
Jean-Louis often came in late, but
made so little noise he was never
disturbed.</p>

<p>A long time passed. Michou was
sleeping soundly, when he heard
Barbette call him.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he asked,
raising himself up in his bed.</p>

<p>"Uncle," said the poor idiot,
"Jean-Louis has not returned."</p>

<p>"Well, what of that?"</p>

<p>"I am hungry," she replied, for
she never ate supper until her work
was finished.</p>

<p>"Eat," said Michou. "What is
there to prevent you?"</p>

<p>"Can I eat Jean-Louis' soup?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Faith," thought the game-keeper,
"he must have supped with the
Luguets. Yes," said he aloud,
"eat, and be off to bed."</p>

<p>Barbette did not wait to be told
twice. She emptied the soup into
a bowl, swallowed half of it with a
good appetite, and gave the rest to
her dog.</p>

<p>Then she went out, fastening the
latch as well as she could, and Michou
turned over in his bed, where
he was soon asleep again, and nothing
else happened to disturb him,
as Jeannet that night did not return
home.</p>


<h4>XVIII.</h4>

<p>The night was terribly cold, and
the following morning the sky was
dark and heavy from the snow that
fell unceasingly; so that our superb
wood of Val-Saint, so delightful in
summer, looked horrible and desolate
enough to make one think of
death and the grave, all around
was so still and quiet in its white
winding-sheet. Michou, who had
nothing to do after he sent off the
workmen, rose later than usual, and
was rather astonished to see Jeannet's
bed still vacant. It was the
first time the dear boy had slept
away from home without giving
warning. He knew him too well to
think that it was from want of attention:
what could have happened?</p>

<p>He thought again of Perdreau,
whom he had seen roving around
the premises the night before; and
for the first time in his life the
game-keeper felt a thrill of terror.</p>

<p>"The good-for-nothing is capable
of anything," thought he; "he
may have watched for Jean-Louis
in some out-of-the-way place to
harm him."</p>

<p>But after this reflection, he reassured
himself by thinking of Jean-Louis'
extraordinary strength and
great height, which surpassed Isidore's
by at least a head.</p>

<p>"That puppy has no more nerve
than a chicken," said he. "Jeannet
could knock him down with
one blow; and as for drawing a
pistol, he would be afraid of the
noise."</p>

<p>However, good Jacques hurried
with his dressing, so that he might
go to the Luguets', to inquire after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_749" id="Page_749">[Pg 749]</a></span>
Jean-Louis. While doing so, he
looked at his big silver watch,
which hung on a nail by his bedside,
and saw with astonishment
that it was nine o'clock.</p>

<p>"This is something strange!"
said he; "it is the first time in ten
years I have slept so late."</p>

<p>He went to the door, but, as he
put out his head, he was driven
back by a whirlwind of snow which
struck him in the face, and at the
same time a man presented himself
upon the threshold.</p>

<p>"M. Michou," said the new-comer,
who was no other than the
letter-carrier of the commune, "it
is unfortunate you have some correspondent
in this awful weather."</p>

<p>"That is true! You are not
very lucky," replied the game-keeper;
"for this is the first letter
you have brought me in two years."</p>

<p>It was from Jean-Louis, and contained
but a few words:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">M. Jacques</span>: Do not be uneasy
about me. I am in good
health, but I will not return before
three days, as I am going to Paris
on important business.</p>

<p>
"Your ever-faithful<br />
<span style="margin-left: 50%;">"<span class="smcap">Jean-Louis</span>."</span><br />
</p>

<p>"What the devil can that child
have to do in Paris?" thought Michou.
"Never mind, this letter is a
great relief; I would rather know
he was off there than here."</p>

<p>He gave the carrier a warm
drink, and conversed with him
some time before the hearth, upon
which burned a good armful of vine-branches.
Then, when he had
taken his departure, the thought
of Barbette suddenly entered his
head.</p>

<p>"What is she doing?" said he.
"The poor child has forgotten my
breakfast; I suppose she has also
slept late."</p>

<p>He opened the door; the snow
was not falling quite so thick and
fast, and the sky appeared less
sombre.</p>

<p>He left the house, and went to
the sheepfold, to see what had become
of his idiotic niece.</p>

<p>Alas! If you have listened to
me until now, you can well guess
what had taken place in that gloomy
night! And yet, upon entering the
enclosure, nothing at first foreboded
the misfortune which was about
to startle the good game-keeper.
The sheep bleated and tumbled
pell-mell, climbing on one another's
backs, browsing contentedly upon
the hay scattered here and there;
but down at the end of the sheepfold,
in a little corner, poor Barbette
was extended, stark dead and already
cold, the mouth half-opened
and the face rigid from its terrible
struggle. Close to her, with his
head laid across her feet, her dog
also slept, never more to be awakened.</p>

<p>It was evident the innocent
child had suffered fearfully. Her
poor body seemed longer by three
inches than before, as though the
limbs had been stretched in her
dreadful death-struggle. Her little,
shrivelled hands still clutched
bunches of wool that she must
have torn from the sheep in her
agony. With all that, she looked
tranquil and at peace, as if an
angel of the good God had come at
the supreme moment to bear away
her soul, exempt from sin.</p>

<p>Michou fell on his knees beside
the little dead body. He tried to
raise her, but she was so stiff he
had to move her like a wooden
statue. Certainly, many hours must
have elapsed since her death; the
dog, also, was frozen to the touch,
and as hard as stone. There was
no doubt these two creatures, so
attached to each other during life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_750" id="Page_750">[Pg 750]</a></span>
had met together a violent death.
Nothing more remained to be done
but to make the necessary declarations
and hold the inquest usual
in such cases. The good man
bent over the agonized face of the
child a few minutes; one or two
tears fell upon his gray beard, and,
while wiping them off with his coat-sleeve,
he recited a Pater and a De
Profundis; then he brought several
planks and bundles of straw, which
he placed around the poor corpse,
so that the sheep should not injure
it while playing around. He left the
dog lying on the feet of his mistress,
Barbette; and mere creature, without
soul, as the good God had made
him, he deserved this respect, having
died faithful as he had lived.</p>

<p>Jacques Michou left the sheepfold,
his otter-skin cap in his hand,
and on the threshold turned again
and made another sign of the cross.
His old heart was heavy with pain
from the shock; but he did not
dream for an instant of what we
know, and at that you must not be
too much astonished. The good
man was perfectly honest, and
could not at first conjecture that a
great crime had caused this extraordinary
death. He rather imagined
that Barbette, who had been
given to wandering around like all
innocents, had gathered some poisonous
weed, or drank by mistake
from a vessel in which remedies
were prepared for the sheep when
afflicted with the mange, which are
always composed of a decoction of
tobacco or other noxious preparation;
which cures, if applied externally,
but is certain death when
taken internally, if the directions are
not followed. Thus plunged in sad
and bitter meditation, he arrived, almost
before he knew it, at the village
of Val-Saint, and thought to
continue still further, to warn Dr.
Aubry. "He will be able to tell
me," thought he; "with his learning
he can say what killed the poor
child."</p>

<p>Just then he raised his head, and
saw that he was before the notary's
house, and recognized the doctor's
horse and wagon before the door.</p>

<p>"This is lucky!" thought he. "I
will find out all the sooner."</p>

<p>He entered without having to
knock, probably because M. Aubry,
who was always absent-minded, had
neglected to close the door, ordinarily
shut tight; so that the game-keeper
found himself standing in
the middle of Perdreau's dining-room
before any one had given notice
of his entrance.</p>

<p>Isidore was there, so wan, and
haggard, and wild-looking, you
would have doubted, at the first
glance, whether it was himself or
his shadow. There was nothing
terrifying in Michou's aspect; he
appeared sad and quiet, and only
wished to meet the doctor, that he
might relate his lamentable story.
But criminals see in every one and
everywhere justice and vengeance
ready to fall upon them. Isidore
no sooner recognized the honest
game-keeper, than he uttered a cry
of terror, and endeavored to escape.</p>

<p>That movement, the terrified
face, and, still further, we must believe,
the inspiration of the good
God, made Michou divine, in the
twinkling of an eye, what he had
not even suspected the moment before.
You will understand me if
you will only recall some remembrances
of the past; for surely you
must once or twice in your life have
experienced the same effect. An
event takes place&mdash;no one knows
which way to turn; all is dark;
suddenly a light breaks forth, shedding
its brilliant rays on all around,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_751" id="Page_751">[Pg 751]</a></span>
and in an instant everything is clear
to the mind: is it not so? To explain
how this great secret fire is
lighted I cannot, but to affirm that
it happens daily you must acknowledge
with me, no matter how poor
your memory may be.</p>

<p>The presence of Perdreau the
evening before in the neighborhood
of the wood of Montreux, his sombre
and agitated look at the time,
the preceding letter of Jean-Louis,
finally, that soup, destined for another
than Barbette, and eaten by
her&mdash;all this passed in a second before
the eyes of the game-keeper,
like so many actors playing in the
same piece. As the truth, in all its
horror, flashed before him, his face
became terrible, and Isidore, whose
eyes, starting from his head with
terror, glared fixedly upon him,
saw this time, without mistake, his
judge and the avenger of his
crime.</p>

<p>The two men looked at each
other a moment. Isidore advanced
a step, in the vague hope of reaching
the door. Michou stepped back,
his arms crossed, and barred his
passage.</p>

<p>"Let me go out," at last gasped
Isidore between his closed teeth.</p>

<p>"Wretch!" said the game-keeper
in a deep voice, "whom did you
come to poison at my house last
night?"</p>

<p>"Michou, you are crazy!" replied
Isidore; "let me out, or I will
call."</p>

<p>"Call as loudly as you please,"
answered Michou, standing straight
and firm with his back against the
door; "call Dr. Aubry, who must
be somewhere about. You will
tell him that I have come in search
of him to prove the death of Barbette,
whom you killed, cowardly
villain that you are!"</p>

<p>"Barbette! What do you mean?
You are drunk, Michou," stammered
Isidore, becoming each moment
more and more livid.</p>

<p>"Neither drunk nor crazy, you
know well, accursed wretch," replied
Jacques. "Your insults do not
harm me. Ha! you were not very
skilful in your crime, but you were
also mistaken. Jean-Louis is safe
and sound; you only killed a child
deprived of reason, and you will
finish on a scaffold; for if I were
allowed to kill you with my own
hand, I would not, so as not to
stain the hand of an honest man."</p>

<p>"Michou," said Isidore, his teeth
chattering with fear, "have mercy
on me; I will explain myself later.
I am sick.... My father is
dying.... You are not cruel....
Let me go out."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! you are a coward....
Faith, I am glad of it; it takes
from me the slightest compassion
for you. Traitor! scoundrel! you
were not so much afraid yesterday,
when you thought of killing a brave,
defenceless boy. To-day it is not
repentance that makes you tremble,
but the justice of men, who will not
spare you. You feel them on your
heels; you are not deceived. I
have you; try to stir."</p>

<p>And he seized him by the arm
with so vigorous a hand, the wretch
felt his bones crack.</p>

<p>"You hurt me; let me go!"
yelled Isidore, writhing under that
iron hand.</p>

<p>"Shut up! Avow your crime; did
you come, yes or no, to poison
Jean-Louis?"</p>

<p>"He had provoked me. I was
wild, I was mad&mdash;let me go...."</p>

<p>"You avow it, then; what poison
was it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; I know nothing
further.... Michou, in the name of
God, let me go...."</p>

<p>"Do you dare pronounce the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_752" id="Page_752">[Pg 752]</a></span>
name of God?" cried Michou, grasping
him still more firmly. "Do you
believe, then, in him, whom you
have blasphemed since you were
able to speak? You don't know
what poison you used? After all,
it matters little; M. Aubry will
know&mdash;yes, he and the judge also.
The case is clear, and, if I could
drag you myself before the police,
I would only leave hold of you
at the door of the prison."</p>

<p>Isidore, prostrated and speechless
from pain&mdash;for Michou, whose
strength was trebled, crushed his
arm with redoubled force&mdash;fell to
the ground in the most miserable
state that can be imagined.</p>

<p>"There," said Michou, pushing
him aside with his foot, "if I did
not still respect the mark of your
baptism, I would wish to see you
die there like a dog. Ah! you can
weep now! See to what your life
of debauchery and idleness has
brought you; but you are not capable
of understanding my words.
Listen; it is not you that I pity, but
the remembrance of an honest girl,
who, to the eyes of the neighborhood,
was your betrothed, the unfortunate
creature! In the name
of Jeanne Ragaud, I will save you
from the scaffold that you deserve;
but on one condition...."</p>

<p>"Speak, speak! I will do whatever
you wish," cried the wretch,
raising himself upon his knees.
"I promise you, Michou; but save
me!"</p>

<p>"Miserable coward!" said the
game-keeper with disgust, "your
prayers and your tears cause me as
much horror as your crimes. You
have not even the courage to play the
part of a murderer! But what I
have said I will do. Get up, if
you have still strength to stand on
your legs. Mark what I say. You
must disappear. I give you, not
three days, like Jean-Louis, but
two hours, in which I will go and
remove the body of your victim,
and warn the police. In two hours
I will have declared on oath that
Barbette was poisoned by you, and
the proofs will not be wanting.
Do what you please&mdash;hide yourself
in a hole or fly. In two hours, I
repeat, the police will be on your
track, and, if the devil wishes to
save you, that is his affair."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Isidore, rising.</p>

<p>"Your thanks is another insult,"
said Michou. He opened the door
himself, and pushed the wretch outside
with such a tremendous blow
of his fist that he stumbled and fell
across the threshold.</p>

<p>Owing to the bad weather, the
village street was deserted. Michou
saw Isidore disappear with the
quickness of a deer. He closed
the door again, and sat down, resting
his head upon his hands, to
gather together his ideas.</p>

<p>"My God," said the excellent
man, raising his eyes to heaven
with the honest look of a Christian,
"perhaps I have done wrong, but
thou art powerful enough to repair
the effect of my too great mercy,
and I have saved from a disgrace
that could not be remedied thy
servants, the poor Ragauds."</p>

<p>All this had not taken much
time, and Michou was meditating
upon the events of that terrible
night, when he felt some one strike
him on the shoulder; it was M.
Aubry.</p>

<p>"It is you, M. Jacques?" said the
doctor. "What are you doing here,
old fellow?"</p>

<p>"I was waiting for you, monsieur,"
replied he quietly, for he
had entirely recovered his self-possession.
"Is any one sick here?"</p>

<p>"Eh?" said the doctor. "It is the
old man, who was seized with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_753" id="Page_753">[Pg 753]</a></span>
fever yesterday, and is now delirious.
His brain is affected. It is an
attack which I anticipated; I don't
think he will recover."</p>

<p>"So much the better!" said
Michou.</p>

<p>"What do you say? So much
the better? It can be easily seen
he is not in your good graces.
Faith! I must say, if I were not
his physician, I would think the
same. I don't generally believe all
the gossip floating around; we can
take a little on credit, and leave
the rest; but, in my opinion, M. le
Marquis did not place his confidence
within the pale of the church
when he gave it to that old ape; he
may yet have to repent of it. Well,
and you&mdash;what can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"Come with me to the wood of
Montreux," said the game-keeper,
"and I will tell you on the way."</p>

<p>"Is the case urgent? Between
ourselves, Michou, if your patient
is not in danger I would like to
put it off until to-morrow. My
carriage is open, and Cocotte is not
rough-shod. It is beastly weather
to go through the forest."</p>

<p>"Alas! monsieur," replied Jacques,
"the patient who requires
you can wait until the last judgment,
for she is dead. But I must
carry you off all the same, as this
death does not seem natural to me,
and I wish your opinion."</p>

<p>"Let us be off," said M. Aubry,
without hesitating; "you can tell
me the whole story as we go along."</p>

<p>Which Jacques Michou did,
whilst Cocotte, with her head down,
trotted along, not very well pleased
to receive the snow full in her face.</p>

<p>The poor beast excepted, neither
of the travellers in the wagon felt
the horrible weather. The doctor,
while listening to the game-keeper,
looked serious and severe, which
was not at all his usual custom.
Michou had nothing to hide. He
related every detail of the mournful
story, without omitting any fact
or thought necessary to enlighten
M. Aubry. When he came to
speak of his terrible explanation
with Isidore and the wretch's crime,
the doctor swore a round oath,
which marked his disapproval, and
Cocotte received such a famous
cut with the whip, she started off
on a furious gallop.</p>

<p>"I did not think you were, at
your age, such a snivelling, sentimental
baby as that," said he in a
rage. "What were you dreaming
about? To have had your hand
on the villain, and then to let him
go! You deserve to be locked up
in his place!"</p>

<p>"Monsieur," replied Michou,
"what I did I would do again.
Have you thought that it would
also have been a frightful trial for
the Ragauds? Would they not all
have been called upon to testify?
And think for a moment what a
disgrace it would have been for
that unfortunate young girl, who
was on the eve of marrying the
scoundrel. No, no, M. Aubry, in
the bottom of your soul you cannot
blame me. Believe that the good
God will bring it all right; but such
a scandal in our province, an execution,
perhaps, in the square of
Val-Saint&mdash;what shame, what misery!"</p>

<p>"Jeanne Ragaud and her family
owe you a fine taper," replied the
doctor, a little softened. "There is
some truth in what you say; but, for
all that, I would have been better
pleased to have seen that dangerous
animal caged!"</p>

<p>"Be easy," replied Michou; "he
will never hurt any one else unless
himself. Without wishing to excuse
him, I am inclined to believe
he was out of his mind&mdash;pushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_754" id="Page_754">[Pg 754]</a></span>
to extremity by the great danger
in which Jeannet's discovery had
placed him. When a man is accustomed
to crime, monsieur, he
bears the consequences more boldly.
I saw Isidore Perdreau so completely
demoralized, his crime was
written on his brow, where I read
it at the first glance, and which
any one else could have done as
easily in my place. So be convinced,
neither God nor man can blame me
for letting him go, and I certainly
do not regret it."</p>

<p>"All very well," said the doctor;
"but that would not prevent me
from acting very differently if I
should catch him this evening."</p>

<p>"Nor I either," replied Michou;
"for if he should fall under my
hand this evening, I would see
clearly that the good God did not
wish him to be saved, at least in
this world."</p>

<p>As he finished speaking, they
stopped before the sheepfold, and
the doctor, together with Michou,
entered, their heads uncovered.
All was as Michou had left it, only
that the cold and the hours which
had elapsed had rendered the little
body still stiffer than at the moment
of discovery. The effects of the
poison began to appear, as great
black spots were visible on the
face of the dead girl, which gave
her such a suffering and pitiful
look, the tears fell from their eyes.</p>

<p>M. Aubry had not to examine
very much to be convinced that
the poor idiot had been poisoned
by taking a dose of arsenic capable
of killing three men. As this poison
is infallible against rats, nearly all the
country people obtain permission
to keep a small quantity on hand;
and nothing had been easier than
for Isidore to take a little from his
father's own kitchen, where the
servant complained of the ravages
of the mice among the cheeses and
other provisions. Thus, step by
step, everything was terribly brought
to light, and yet with much simplicity,
as is always the case with
events incontestably true; therefore,
it was easy for M. Aubry to
prepare his statements, affirmations,
and declarations according to his
conscience, in the report which he
read before the official authorities.</p>

<p>One very sad thing, but which
they scarcely thought of at the moment,
was to give a rather more
decent bed than the straw of the
sheepfold to the poor innocent victim.
But this they could not do, as
they were obliged to let her lie as
she was until the arrival of the district
attorney, the sheriff, and the
chief of police.</p>

<p>Michou would willingly have
watched by her side, but this was
not possible either. M. Aubry aided
him to construct a solid barrier
of planks; then they covered
the body with a blanket; and on the
breast the game-keeper placed, with
profound respect, a cross made of
branches. This devout duty accomplished,
Jacques Michou locked the
sheepfold, put the key in his pocket,
and left with the doctor to warn the
authorities.</p>

<p>You can imagine that in all this
coming and going much more time
had elapsed than the two hours
accorded to the fugitive. Michou,
who desired it from the bottom of
his heart, for the good reasons we
already know, and which he did not
regret, was not sorry at the delay.
M. Aubry, on the contrary, growled
and stormed, whipped Cocotte with
the full strength of his arm, and tried
to hurry up affairs with the greatest
diligence. But impossibilities cannot
be performed, and, with all his
efforts, the usual formalities in these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_755" id="Page_755">[Pg 755]</a></span>
sad circumstances were not fulfilled
until late in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Then the news spread from
mouth to mouth as rapidly as the
waves of our river during an inundation.
The curious assembled in
the public square, where the servants
of M. le Marquis, who never were
bothered with too much work,
were the first to appear. They
talked, they gesticulated, said heaps
of foolish things, mixed with some
words of common sense. Our master
learned from public rumor that
young Perdreau was suspected, and
that he had disappeared. It can
be easily understood that he was
indignant at such a calumny, and
generously offered to guarantee his
innocence. Mademoiselle wept,
Dame Berthe imitated her, and
these two excellent ladies wished
immediately to rush off to Jeannette,
to console her in this great
trial. But poor mademoiselle had
to be content with her benevolent
wishes, for neither coachman nor
footman, nor even a simple groom,
could be found; all had run off to
the wood of Montreux in search of
news.</p>

<p>As they were obliged to pass Muiceron
to reach the wood, you may
well imagine that more than one of
the hurried crowd lagged behind to
talk to the Ragauds, and thus they,
in their turn, heard of the terrible
affair. The consternation was unparalleled,
for there, as at the château,
no one would believe the wicked
rumors afloat concerning Isidore.
Jeannette, who cared but little for
her intended husband, and had desired
to be freed from her engagement,
was indignant as soon as she
thought he was in trouble, and defended
him warmly, which made
people believe she loved him devotedly.
The truth was, this little
creature's soul was generous and
high-strung, and, like all such natures,
she defended him, whom she
willingly would have sent off the
night before, only because she
thought he was unfortunate.</p>

<p>But days passed, and each one
brought new and overwhelming
proofs of the truth. The police
searched the neighborhood in vain,
and soon all hope of seeing Isidore
reappear (which would have pleaded
in his justification) faded from the
eyes of those who wished to defend
him. M. le Marquis, after having
conversed with M. Aubry, Michou,
and the judicial authorities, was
overcome with grief, and acknowledged
that he could not conscientiously
mix himself up with the affair.
As for old Perdreau, he never
recovered his consciousness, and
died shortly after. They placed
the seals on his house, where, later,
they discovered the documents and
correspondence which revealed his
wicked life; and now you can judge
if there was anything to gossip about
in a commune as peaceable and
tranquil as ours. In the memory
of man there had never been such
a terrible event, and nothing will
ever happen again approaching to
it, I devoutly wish.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle, who was not very
well, was seriously injured by all
this trouble; and as M. le Marquis
loved her dearly, and, besides,
heard the rumbling of the revolution
in the capital which he had so
long ardently desired, packed up,
and was soon off, bag and baggage,
for Paris, where he hoped to distract
poor mademoiselle, and drive
off mournful recollections.</p>

<h3>PHILOSOPHICAL TERMINOLOGY.</h3>


<h4>III.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">To The Editor Of The Catholic
World:</span></p>

<p>In my last letter, while criticising
an incorrect definition of the word
<em>act</em>, I made the remark that "the
gravity of bodies is not a <em>power</em>, as
some unphilosophical scientists imagine."<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
When writing these words,
I had to confine myself to a mere
statement of the scientific error;
but it occurs to me that in an age
in which most of the so-called men
of science are so little acquainted
with philosophy as to mistake effects
for causes, and yet so proud of their
achievements as to aspire to the
leadership of the public mind, some
precautions must be taken, lest our
philosophical terminology be infected
with such improprieties as
are now too leniently tolerated in
the language of science. It is the
abuse of one word that does the
greatest mischief in the department
of physics. This word is <em>force</em>.
Its frequent misapplication tends
to confound and falsify the whole
doctrine of physical causation. It
is therefore of great importance,
even in a scientific point of view,
to determine within what limits the
use of such a word should be restricted
in accordance with the laws
of philosophical terminology. Such
is the main object of my present
communication.</p>

<p>The theory of physical causation
deals with natural causes, powers,
actions, forces, movements, and the
results of movements. When these
terms are properly defined, all relations
between agents and patients,
between causes and effects, and
consequent phenomena, can be easily
expressed with philosophical
precision; but when the causes,
the powers, the actions, and the
movements themselves are all confounded
under one common name
of <em>force</em>, as it is now the fashion in
the scientific world to do, no one
need be surprised if such a course
ends in philosophical inconsistencies.
To show what great proportions
this evil has taken, innumerable
passages of modern writers
might be adduced. But, not to
perplex the reader with conflicting
quotations from different sources, I
will give only a few extracts from
one of the best representatives of
modern science. I have before me
the <cite>Correlation of Physical Forces</cite>,
by Mr. Grove. It is a well-known
little work, much esteemed by physicists,
and one which certainly
transcends the average merit of
many modern productions of the
same kind. Now, what is Mr.
Grove's notion of cause, of force,
of power, as compared with one
another and with the phenomena
of nature? The following passages
will show. He says:</p>

<p>"In each particular case, where
we speak of cause, we habitually
refer to some antecedent power or
force; we never see motion or any
change in matter take effect, without
regarding it as produced by
some previous change" (p. 13).</p>

<p>Here <em>force</em>, <em>power</em>, and <em>cause</em> are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_758" id="Page_758">[Pg 758]</a></span>
taken as equivalent; moreover, <em>motion</em>,
or a change in matter, is considered
as "produced" by a previous
change; which implies that a
previous change or movement is
the efficient cause of a subsequent
change or movement. Hence, according
to such a terminology,
movement, force, power, and cause
should be accepted as synonymous.
But philosophy cannot admit of
such a wholesale confusion.</p>

<p>"A force," says he, "cannot
originate otherwise than by devolution
from some pre-existing force or
forces.... The term 'force,' although
used in very different senses
by different authors, in its limited
sense may be defined as that which
produces or resists motion.... I
use the term 'force' as meaning
that active principle inseparable
from matter, which is supposed to
induce its various changes" (p. 16).</p>

<p>Here <em>force</em> is again confounded
with <em>power</em> and with <em>cause</em>, inasmuch
as "active principles" are
<em>powers</em>, and "that which produces
or resists motion" is a <em>cause</em>. We
are told at the same time that the
active principle is not a primordial
and essential constituent of material
substances, but an accidental result
of devolution from other active
principles residing in other substances.
Philosophy cannot admit of
such a phraseology; for, as the
active principle of a substance is a
constituent of its nature, if the active
principle of any substance were
thus communicated to it by accidental
devolution, such a substance
would have no definite nature of
its own, and would be nothing; and,
in spite of this, it would also be
capable of becoming anything, according
as its active principle might
originate from different pre-existing
forces. Now, we know that the
first elements of any given substance
have a definite nature, and a definite
active principle independently
of devolution from other substances;
and that, according to the results
of a constant and universal
experience, they are not liable to
exchange their nature for anything
else, but keep it permanently and
unalterably amidst all the vicissitudes
brought about by the interference
of surrounding bodies. It
is, therefore, plain that the "active
principle inseparable from matter"
cannot originate in devolution from
other pre-existing forces. But let
us proceed.</p>

<p>"The position which I seek to
establish in this essay," says Mr.
Grove, "is, that the various affections
of matter which constitute
the main object of experimental
physics&mdash;viz., heat, light, electricity,
magnetism, chemical affinity, and
motion&mdash;are all correlative, or have
a reciprocal dependence; that
neither, taken abstractedly, can be
said to be the essential cause of the
others, but that either may produce,
or be convertible into, any of the
others" (p. 15).</p>

<p>Every one, of course, will admit
that heat, light, electricity, etc., are
"correlative." I also admit that
they are not "essential causes" of
one another; but the fact is that
they are no causes at all; since
heat, light, electricity, etc., are only
modes of motion and "affections
of matter," as the author acknowledges,
and are therefore to be considered
as mere phenomena or
effects, of which the one can be the
condition, but not the cause, of the
other. I know that the popular
language admits of such expressions
as "heat causes dilatation,"
"light causes an impression on the
retina," "chemical affinity causes
combination," "movement causes a
change of place." But these and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_759" id="Page_759">[Pg 759]</a></span>
other similar expressions, though
used by scientific writers, and even
by philosophers, are by no means
philosophically correct. We shall
see presently that substances alone
have efficient powers, and therefore
no mode of being and no affection
of matter can display efficient causality.
Hence light, heat, electricity,
and the rest, are neither efficient
causes nor efficient powers; and,
inasmuch as they are affections of
matter, they cannot even be called
<em>forces</em> in a philosophical, but only
in a technical, sense, as we shall explain
hereafter.</p>

<p>As to the mutual "convertibility"
of these various affections of matter
into one another, I would observe
that, although the expression may
be correctly understood, yet, as interpreted
by Mr. Grove and by
other physicists, it cannot be
admitted. What do we mean
when we say that progressive motion,
for instance, is converted into
heat? We mean that in proportion
as the progressive movement of a
body is resisted and <em>extinguished</em>, a
correspondent amount of heat, or
of molecular calorific vibrations, is
<em>produced</em> by mutual actions and reactions.
In this sense the conversion
of one mode of being into another
is perfectly admissible, no
less indeed than the passage from a
state of rest to one of movement.
But Mr. Grove does not understand
it so. He thinks that the progressive
movement of a body is never
extinguished, but only transformed
by subdivision into molecular
calorific vibrations; and, therefore,
that the same accidental entity
which was to be found in the progressive
movement is still to be
found <em>identically</em>, though subdivided,
in the calorific motion. Let us
hear him:</p>

<p>"It is very generally believed
that, if the visible and palpable motion
of one body be arrested by
impact on another body, the motion
ceases, and the force which produced
it is annihilated. Now, the view
which I venture to submit is that
force cannot be annihilated, but is
merely subdivided or altered in
direction or character" (p. 24).
"<em>Motion</em> will directly produce <em>heat</em>
and <em>electricity</em>, and electricity, being
produced by it, will produce magnetism"
(p. 34). "Lastly, <em>motion</em>
may be again reproduced by the
forces which have emanated from
motion" (p. 36).</p>

<p>Such is Mr. Grove's theory of the
"convertibility of forces." It is
nothing but a wrong interpretation
of the old theory of the "conservation
of <i lang="la">vis viva</i>" by the modern
conception of "potential energy,"
which admits "forces stored up"
in bodies, and ready to show themselves
in the form of velocity, heat,
light, or any other kind of movement.
This notion and others of
a like tendency constitute the marrow
of the new physical theories,
and are the pride of our men of
science. Let us hope that a time
will come when these able men
will see the vanity of such fashionable
doctrines, and blush for their
adoption of them in their scientific
generalizations.</p>

<p>The conservation of <i lang="la">vis viva</i> is,
within certain limits, that is with
regard to ponderable bodies impinging
on one another,<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> an established
fact; but its interpretation
as given by advanced physicists is
a huge blunder. "It is very generally
believed," says Mr. Grove,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_760" id="Page_760">[Pg 760]</a></span>"that if the visible motion of one
body be arrested by impact on another
body, the motion ceases."
Of course, it is believed; and, what
is more, it is demonstrably true,
whatever Mr. Grove may say to the
contrary. Yet it is not true, nor is
it very generally believed, that "the
force which produces it (the motion)
is annihilated." When the
movement of a body is arrested, its
velocity is <em>extinguished</em>; but that
velocity was not the force which
<em>produced</em> the movement. When a
stone falls to the ground, its movement
is produced, not by its velocity,
but by the action of the earth
on it. Velocity is only the formal
principle of movement, and is itself
included in movement as a constituent,
not as an efficient power.
To say that velocity produces
movement is, therefore, to confound
formal with efficient causation, and
to admit that movement produces
itself. This is one of the conclusions
for which I hope, as I said,
physicists will blush hereafter.</p>

<p>But the force, we are told, "is
not annihilated, but merely subdivided
or altered in direction or
character." This cannot be. The
word <em>force</em> here means a quantity
of movement, which is nothing but
the product of the velocity into the
mass of the body. Now, the velocity
of a body is not subdivided
when the movement is arrested, but
is really extinguished. I say <em>extinguished</em>,
not <em>annihilated</em>; because
annihilation, as well as creation, regards
substances, not accidents.
Velocity is an accident; it is therefore
neither created nor annihilated,
but originates in a determination
produced by an agent, and ends by
exhaustion or neutralization under
the influence of an antagonistic
agency. I say, then, that the movement
of the body, though not annihilated,
is extinguished and not
subdivided. It is impossible to
conceive of divisions where there is
nothing divisible. On the other
hand, nothing is divisible which has
no extension and no material parts.
Now, where are the material parts
or the extension of velocity? Velocity
in each primitive particle of
a body is a simple actuality, which
can increase or decrease by degrees
of intensity, but cannot be taken to
pieces in order to be apportioned
among the other particles of the
body, and therefore the pretended
subdivision of velocities is a mere
absurdity.</p>

<p>Nor does it matter that force can
be "altered in direction or character."
We must not forget that <em>force</em>
is here a sum of velocities, and accordingly
cannot change direction
or character unless such velocities
are intrinsically changed. But they
cannot be changed with regard to
either character or direction without
some new degree of velocity
being produced or extinguished by
some efficient cause. For the character
of velocity is to actuate the
extension of the movement in proportion
to its own intensity. This,
and no other, is its character; and,
therefore, velocity cannot be altered
in character without its intensity
being increased or diminished by
action. And the same is to be said
of the change of direction, which
cannot be conceived without action.
Now, if action can modify motion,
and diminish to any extent its velocity,
it remains for our scientists
to explain how a certain action cannot
stifle movement and velocity
altogether.</p>

<p>They will say that the "indestructibility
of force" is the only
hypothesis consistent with the theory
of the conservation of <i lang="la">vis viva</i>,
and consequently that the two must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_761" id="Page_761">[Pg 761]</a></span>
stand or fall together. But the
truth is that the conservation of
<i lang="la">vis viva</i> needs no such hypothesis,
since it depends on a quite different
principle, viz., on the equality of
action and reaction.</p>

<p>When two billiard-balls impinge
on one another, they act and react.
Their molecules urge one another
(by their mutual actions of course,
not by their velocity), and become
compressed. All the work they do
up to the <em>maximum</em> of compression
is styled <em>action</em>. But reaction soon
follows; for, as compression brings
the neighboring molecules into an
unnatural position where they cannot
settle in relative equilibrium,
the molecular exertions tend now
to restore within the bodies the original
molecular distances; which
work of restoration is properly called
<em>reaction</em>.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> And since reaction
must undo what the preceding action
had done, hence the amount
of the reaction must equal the
amount of the action, and thus no
energy is lost; for the same quantity
of movement is produced in
one ball as is extinguished in the
other.</p>

<p>I do not wish to enlarge on this
topic, which is of a physical rather
than metaphysical nature. I only
repeat that the mistake of our physicists
lies in supposing that the
quantity of movement which is lost
by one body still exists in nature,
and passes <em>identically</em> into another
body; whilst the fact is that the
quantity of movement lost by the
first body is altogether extinguished,
and the quantity acquired by
the second body is a new production
altogether. To send an accidental
mode, such as velocity,
travelling about from one substance
to another without support, as an
independent and self-sufficient being,
may be a bright device of modern
progress; but when the time
comes for repenting of other scientific
blunders, this bright delusion
will, I am sure, be reckoned among
the most grievous philosophical sins
that science will have to regret and
to atone for in sackcloth and ashes.</p>

<p>These remarks go far to show
that the terminology of our modern
scientists concerning physical causation
is philosophically incorrect.
I have more to say on this same
subject; but to make things plainer
I wish to give beforehand what I
consider to be the true distinction
between cause, power, action, and
force, as implied in the causation
of natural phenomena. To do this
in the most simple and intelligible
manner, I lay down the following
propositions:</p>

<p>I. It is a principle philosophically
certain that the substance of all
natural things has been created by
God for his extrinsic glory&mdash;that is,
for the manifestation of his power
and other perfections. Accordingly,
every created substance has received
a natural aptitude and fitness
to manifest in some manner
and in some degree the power and
perfection of its Creator.</p>

<p>II. Therefore, every creature naturally,
<i lang="la">per se</i>, not accidentally, but
by the very fact of its creation, is
destined to act; for manifestation
is action, and consequently possesses
permanently and intrinsically
such an <em>active power</em> as is proportionate
to the kind and degree of
the intended manifestation. In
other terms, every created substance
is destined to be the <em>efficient
cause</em> of determined effects.</p>

<p>III. The power of created sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_762" id="Page_762">[Pg 762]</a></span>stances
is finite, and its exertion is
subject to definite laws. All finite
power, according as it is exerted
under more or less favorable conditions,
gives rise to effects of
greater or less intensity. Hence
different effects may proceed from
one and the same cause, and equal
effects from different causes, acting
under different conditions.</p>

<p>IV. The exertion of power is
called <em>action</em>, and its intensity, in
the material world, depends on the
distance of the agent from the patient.</p>

<p>V. The amount of the exertion,
or the quantity of the action, is
measured by its true effect, which
is the only true exponent or representative
of the degree of the exertion;
for, all matter being equally
indifferent to receive motion, the
amount of its passion must always
agree with the amount of the action
received; and thus the one is
the natural and necessary measure
of the other.</p>

<p>VI. The amount of the exertion,
as measured by the effect it is able
to produce, is what in the scientific
language can be styled <em>force</em> properly.</p>

<p>VII. The amount of the effect,
as measuring the amount of the exertion
from which it arises, or by
which it is neutralized, is again
called <em>force</em>, but improperly, and
only in a technical sense, as it is in
fact a mere measure of force.</p>

<p>These propositions are so logically
connected with one another
that, the first of them being admitted,
all the others must follow.
I might, therefore, dispense with all
discussion with regard to them;
yet, to help the scientific reader to
form a philosophical notion of
forces, I will endeavor to throw
some additional light on my sixth
and seventh propositions.</p>

<p>And, first, I observe that since
forces can only be measured by
their effects, the mathematical expression
of a force always exhibits
the quantity of the effect which such
a force is competent to cause; and
as such an effect is a certain quantity
of movement, hence forces are
mathematically expressed in terms
of movement. So long as physicists
preserved their old philosophical
traditions, a distinction was
kept up between force and movement.
A quantity of movement
was indeed called <em>a force</em>, inasmuch
as it was the true measure of
the action from which it had originated,
or by which it could be destroyed;
but such a <em>force</em> was not
confounded with the action itself.
The action was called <i lang="la">vis motrix</i>, a
motive force, whilst the quantity of
movement was called <em>vis</em> simply,
and was not considered as having
any efficient causality. Thus before
Dr. Mayer's invention of "potential
energies," the word <em>force</em>
was used with proper discrimination:
1st, as a quantity of action
actually producing movement; 2d,
as a quantity of action actually opposed
by a resistance sufficient to
prevent the production of movement;
3d, as a quantity of movement
and a measure of action.</p>

<p>A quantity of action followed by
movement was called a <em>dynamical</em>
force, and was measured by the
quantity of movement imparted in
the unit of time. Its mathematical
expression in rational mechanics
was, and is still, a differential coefficient
of the <em>second order</em> representing
the product of the mass acted
on into the velocity which the action,
if continued for a unit of time,
would communicate to it. As instances
of <em>dynamical</em> force, we may
mention the action of the sun on
the planets, of the planets on their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_763" id="Page_763">[Pg 763]</a></span>
satellites, of the earth on a pendulum,
on a drop of rain, etc.</p>

<p>A quantity of action not followed
by movement was called a <em>statical</em>
force, and was measured by the
quantity of movement into which it
would develop, if no obstacle existed.
Its mathematical expression
in rational mechanics is a differential
coefficient of the <em>first order</em> representing
the product of the mass,
whose movement is neutralized into
its virtual velocity. By <em>virtual</em>
velocity we mean the velocity which
the mass would acquire in a unit
of time, if all resistance to the
movement were suddenly suppressed.
As instances of <em>statical</em>
force, we may mention the action
of a weight on the string from
which it hangs, or on the table on
which it lies.</p>

<p>A quantity of movement, or the
dynamical effect of all the actions
to which a body has been subjected
for any length of time, was called a
<em>kinetic</em> force. As kinetic forces
cannot be destroyed except by actions
producing equal and opposite
quantities of movement, hence
every kinetic force can be taken as
a measure, not only of the amount
of action from which it has resulted,
but also of the amount of action
by which it can be checked. The
mathematical expression of a <em>kinetic</em>
force is the product of the moving
mass into its actual velocity. As
instances of this force, we may mention
<em>the momentum</em> of a cannon-ball,
of a hammer, of wind, falling water,
etc.</p>

<p>To obviate the many abuses
which this notion of kinetic force
has engendered, and to cut the
ground from under the feet of those
blundering theorists who reduce
all forces to movement, it is important
to remark that kinetic force
could be defined as "that quantity
of action which a moving body can
exercise against an obstacle until
its velocity is exhausted." This
definition would change nothing in
the mathematical expression of kinetic
forces; for the quantity of
the action which a moving body
can exercise against the obstacle is
exactly equal to the quantity of
movement, or momentum, by which
the body is animated. The only
change would be in the terminology,
which, instead of technical,
would become philosophical. As
instances of kinetic force thus defined,
we might mention <em>the quantity
of action</em> of a cannon-ball, of the
hammer on the anvil, of the wind
on the sails, etc.</p>

<p>The division of forces into dynamical,
statical, and kinetic has
been long recognized by all competent
judges as very good and satisfactory.
But our men of progress,
in the innocent belief that, before
they appeared on the scene, everything
in this world was darkness,
have changed all that. All forces
are now stated to consist in nothing
but "mass animated by velocity."
Dynamical forces are rejected, it
would seem, because they imply
what modern science cannot, or
will not, understand&mdash;<em>i.e.</em> real production
(they call it <em>creation</em>) of
movement. On the other hand,
statical forces are not masses animated
by velocity, and thus are set
aside because they originate no
real movement. Such is the consistency
of our progressional friends.</p>

<p>Yet so long as all effect will need
a cause, there can be no doubt that
statical forces must be real forces.
Two weights balancing one another
at the ends of a lever certainly act
on one another, as every one must
admit who observes the change
produced by taking away one of
the two. A weight which actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_764" id="Page_764">[Pg 764]</a></span>
prevents another weight from falling
surely exerts a positive influence
on it, and therefore displays
power and brings forth an amount
of action. So also, when a weight
is at rest on a table, gravity does
not remain dormant with regard to
it, but urges it toward the table
with unyielding tenacity. Hence
the table must continually react in
order to keep the body at rest. It
is evident, therefore, that the weight,
while at rest on the table, exerts its
powers and is engaged in real action;
for nothing but real action
can awaken real reaction. Again,
when we try to raise a weight, we
feel that we must overcome a real
resistance; and when we support a
weight, we feel its action upon our
limbs. Hence pressure is a real
force, though it be not mass animated
by velocity; and the same is
evidently to be said of traction, torsion,
flexion, etc. It is, therefore,
impossible to ignore statical forces.</p>

<p>That dynamical forces are likewise
indispensable in science I
think it would be quite superfluous
to prove. Rational mechanics is
wholly based upon them, and no
phenomenon in nature can be explained
without them. If modern
science finds it difficult to understand
the production of local movement,
let her consider that, after
all, it would be less damaging to her
reputation to confess her philosophical
ignorance than to deny
what all mankind hold and know to
be a fact.</p>

<p>From this short discussion we
may safely conclude, with the old
physicists, that there are in nature
dynamical and statical as well as
kinetic forces, and that the word
<em>force</em> should be uniformly used in
philosophy as expressing a quantity
of action measured by the quantity
of its effect, or by something equivalent.
But we have not yet done
with our advanced theorists.</p>

<p>It is curious that, after having reduced
all forces to "mass animated
by velocity," they have not hesitated
to introduce into science a force
which is neither mass animated
by velocity nor a common statical
force, but something quite different,
to which they gave the name of
"potential energy." The first to
imagine this spurious force was, if
I am not mistaken, the German Dr.
Mayer, one of the great leaders of
modern thought, who, considering
that a body raised from the floor
would, if abandoned to itself, fall
down and acquire a momentum
calculated to do an amount of work,
conceived the raising of the body
as equivalent to a communication
of latent energy destined to become
visible at any time in the shape of
movement as soon as the body is
left to itself. Such an energy, as
still unevolved, was called "potential
energy."</p>

<p>"If we define 'energy' to mean
the power of doing work," says a
well-known English professor, "a
stone shot upwards with great velocity
may be said to have in it a
great deal of actual energy, because
it has the power of overcoming up
to a great height the obstacle interposed
by gravity to its ascent, just
as a man of great energy has the
power of overcoming obstacles.
But this stone, as it continues to
mount upwards, will do so with a
gradually decreasing velocity, until
at the summit of its flight all the
actual energy with which it started
will have been spent in raising it
against the force of gravity to this
elevated position. It is now moving
with no velocity&mdash;just, in fact,
beginning to turn&mdash;and we may
suppose it to be caught and lodged
upon the top of a house. Here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_765" id="Page_765">[Pg 765]</a></span>
then, it remains at rest, without the
slightest tendency to motion of any
kind, and we are led to ask, What
has become of the energy with
which it began its flight? Has
this energy disappeared from the
universe without leaving behind it
any equivalent? Is it lost for ever,
and utterly wasted?... Doubtless
the stone is at rest on the top
of the house, and hence possesses
no <em>energy of motion</em>; but it nevertheless
possesses <em>energy</em> of another
kind <em>in virtue of its position</em>; for
we can at any time cause it to drop
down upon a pile, and thus drive it
into the ground, or make use of its
downward momentum to grind corn,
or to turn a wheel, or in a variety
of useful ways. It thus appears
that when a stone which has been
projected upwards has been caught
at the summit of its flight and lodged
on the top of a house, the energy
of actual motion with which it
started has been changed into another
form of energy, which we denominate
energy of position, or potential
energy, and that, by allowing
the stone again to fall, we may change
this energy of position once more
into actual energy, so that the stone
will reach the ground with a velocity,
and hence with an energy, equal
precisely to that with which it was
originally projected upwards."<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>Such is the theory. It is scarcely
necessary to say that the whole
of it is a delusion. First, the velocity
imparted to the stone is not a
working power, but only a condition
for doing work, as I shall presently
show; and, therefore, it cannot
be styled "energy."</p>

<p>Secondly, when the stone is
caught at the summit of its ascent,
and (according to the strange phrase
of the author) <em>is moving with no velocity</em>,
it possesses nothing more
than it possessed when lying on the
ground. Its elevated position is
only a new local relation, which
confers no power, either actual or
potential. It is indeed possible to
let the stone drop down; but then
its fall will be due to the action of
the earth, and consequently to extrinsic
causation, not to anything
possessed by the stone on account
of its elevated position.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the words "potential
energy" cannot be coupled with
one another without absurdity;
for "energy," according to all,
means <em>power to act</em>, whilst "potential"
means <em>liability to be acted on</em>.
Hence "potential energy" would
mean either a power to act which is
ready to be acted on, or a power
which is to be acquired by the body
through its being acted on. The
first alternative confounds act with
passive potency, and action with
passion; the second assumes that
the velocity to be acquired by the
body is a real working power,
which it is not.</p>

<p>Fourthly, it is against reason to
admit that "the energy of actual
motion is changed into another
form of energy." For where is the
causality of the change? The only
causality concerned with the modification
of the upward movement of
the stone is the action of gravity;
and this, being directly antagonistic
to the ascensional velocity, tends to
destroy, not to transform, it.</p>

<p>Fifthly, a stone created originally
on the brink of a precipice would
be ready to fall into it, although it
has never been thrown up; on the
contrary, a stone thrown up to such
a height as to reach the limits of
the moon's effectual attraction
would never come down again, notwithstanding
the enormous amount
of pretended "actual energy" ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_766" id="Page_766">[Pg 766]</a></span>pended
in the mighty ascent. Hence
the upward flight has nothing whatever
to do with any so-called "potential
energy." It is, therefore, a
gross delusion to hold that by allowing
the stone again to fall, "we
may change the potential energy
into actual energy," it being evident
that the actual velocity of the falling
stone is not a result of transformation,
but the product of continuous
action.</p>

<p>We cannot, then, adopt the phrase
"potential energy" in metaphysics.
The phrase means nothing; for
there is nothing in nature which
can be designated by such a name.
<em>Energy</em> is synonymous with <em>power</em>;
and power cannot be in a potential
state. To be in potency to receive
any amount of velocity is not energy,
but passivity. On the other hand,
the power of doing work is not a
mere <em>force</em>, as assumed by the modern
theory, but is something much
higher and better. Forces are only
variable quantities of action; the
power, on the contrary, in one and
the same body is always the same,
and yet is competent to do more or
less work, according as it is exerted
under more or less favorable conditions.
The stone that is hurled
against a pane of glass exerts, in
breaking it, the very same power
which it exerted before being hurled;
only the conditions of the exertion
are quite different, inasmuch
as its velocity brings it against the
glass at such a rate that, before its
movement can be checked by the
action of the glass, the stone has
time to outrun it, dashing it to
pieces. Yet it is <em>by its action, not
by its velocity</em>, that it does such a
work. Of course, its action is proportional
to its velocity, and its work
is proportional to the square of its
velocity; and thus the velocity serves
to measure both the work and the
action, but it does not follow that the
velocity is the active power. Velocity
is an accidental mode of being;
and <em>nothing accidental is active</em>.
This important philosophical truth
can be easily established as follows:</p>

<p>In all things the principle of being
is the principle of operation, as
philosophers agree; whence the
axioms, "By what a thing is, by that
it acts," and "Everything has active
power inasmuch as it has being."
Now, all substance has its
being independently of accidents;
therefore, all substance has its active
power independently of accidents.
On the other hand, accidents
give to the substance a <em>mode</em>
of being, and nothing more; therefore,
they also determine its <em>mode</em>
of acting, and nothing more. But
as to be in this or that state presupposes
<em>being</em>, so also to have a power
ready to act in this or that manner
presupposes <em>power</em>. Hence no accident
gives active power to the
substance of which it is the accident;
or, in other terms, accidents
are nothing more than conditions
determining the mode of application
of the active powers that pre-exist
in the substance.</p>

<p>Again, all natural accidents<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> are
reducible to three classes; as some
of them are <em>accidental acts</em> produced
by some agent and passively received
in some subject, others are
<em>intrinsic modes of being</em> resulting
from the reception of such accidental
acts, and, lastly, a great many are
<em>mere relativities</em> or relative modes.
Now, that relativities can act no
one has ever pretended to assert.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_767" id="Page_767">[Pg 767]</a></span>
That intrinsic modes of being can
act, is implicitly assumed by all
who consider velocity as an active
power; for velocity is an intrinsic
mode of being. Yet if we ask
them whether the <em>existence</em> of things
is competent to act, they will certainly
answer <em>no</em>; and they will be
right. But, I say, if existence cannot
act, still less can a mere mode
of existing act. For a mode of existing
is a reality incomparably less
than existence itself. Accordingly,
since they concede that not the existence,
but the thing existing, is a
principle of action, they must also
<i lang="fr">à fortiori</i> concede that the thing
modified, and not its mode, is a
principle of action. Finally, with
regard to the accidental act, it is
evident that its reception in the
substance cannot impart to it any
new activity, since its formal effect
simply consists in a new mode of
being, which, as we have just seen,
is not active. It is clear, then,
that no natural accident has active
power.</p>

<p>Omitting other reasons drawn
from theoretical considerations, and
which might be usefully developed
in special metaphysics, I will only
add an <i lang="fr">à posteriori</i> proof, which
physicists will probably find more
congenial to their habit of thought.
It consists in the fact that bodies
act on one another without being
animated by velocity, or without
their velocity having any share in
the production of the effect. Thus
a book at rest on a table acts on
the table; and a liquid, or a gas, at
rest in a jar acts on the jar. On
the other hand, the earth, though
not at rest, attracts bodies, not by
its diurnal rotation or by its annual
revolution, but by a power dependent
only on its mass; and the
same is to be said of the sun and
the planets. This shows that the
power from which the motive action
of bodies proceeds is not their velocity;
whence it follows that velocity
is only an affection of bodies,
and has no bearing upon the
active powers of the same, but only
on the mode of their application.
Now, since all the accidents which
have been supposed to involve active
power can be resolved into
kinds of movement, it must be owned
that such accidents have no real
activity; for all kinds of movements
consist of velocity, and velocity
does not act.</p>

<p>Hence, whatever scientists may
say to the contrary, heat, light, electricity,
etc., are not efficient powers,
but modes of movement, on which
the mode of acting of bodies depends.
When heat was thought to
be a subtle imponderable substance,
philosophers could consistently call
it an efficient power; but since it
is now decided that heat is only "a
mode of motion," how can we still
attribute to it what is the exclusive
property of substances? If heat is
only a mode of motion, a bar of
iron, when hot, has no greater
powers than when cold; it has only
a greater movement. So also, if
light is only a mode of motion, luminiferous
æther has no greater
power when undulating in the open
air than when at rest in a dark
room. In the same manner air,
when perfectly still, has the same
powers as when actually propagating
any variety of sounds. When,
therefore, physicists speak to us of
such movements as powers, let us
not be imposed upon by their phraseology,
if we wish to be consistent
in our reasonings, and avoid useless
and troublesome disputes.</p>

<p>Yet it was to be expected that our
physicists in their technical language
would confound heat, light,
and other modes of movement with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_768" id="Page_768">[Pg 768]</a></span>
forces and powers. The correlation
between such movements and
the actions of the bodies subjected
to them is, in fact, such as to allow
of the former being taken for measure
of the latter. Thus a given
amount of mechanical action may
give rise to a definite amount of
heat, and <i lang="la">vice versa</i>; hence the one
can be technically considered as the
equivalent of the other, inasmuch
as the one is the measure of the
other. But does it follow that action
and heat belong to the same
category? Certainly not. It is
not the action itself, but its mechanical
effect, that should be taken
as the true equivalent of the heat
generated. And when we are told
that "heat is expended in generating
mechanical movement," we
must not fancy that calorific movement
<em>causes</em> another kind of movement,
as the phrase seems to imply,
but only that, while the calorific
movement is diminished by a given
cause, the same cause generates the
mechanical movement. We should
always bear in mind that the language
of modern science, though
correctly expressing the correspondence
of effects to effects, is very far
from expressing as correctly the relation
of effects to causes. Physicists
should learn to distinguish between
efficient causes and conditions
determining the mode of their causation.
Heat is one of such conditions,
and to call it a <em>force</em> is to
endow it with efficient causality;
for the term <em>force</em> always conveys
the idea of causation. They should
either cease to describe heat as a
force, or, if this cannot be done,
explain more explicitly than they
do the technical restrictions modifying
the philosophical meaning of
the word. We can hardly expect
that they will follow our advice;
but, at any rate, it is to be hoped
that philosophers at least will take
care to follow it, and guard against
the corruption of their own terminology.</p>

<p>Besides heat, light, electricity,
and magnetism, there are many
other modes of being technically
called <em>forces</em>. Centrifugal force is
one of them; for, in fact, centrifugal
force, in spite of the name, is
nothing more than "that quantity
of movement which is extinguished
by centripetal action in the unit of
time."</p>

<p>The force of inertia&mdash;<i lang="la">vis inertiæ</i>&mdash;is
another technical or conventional
force. For it is plain that inertia
cannot act; and thus it is impossible
to conceive any true force of
inertia. But, technically, <i lang="la">vis inertiæ</i>
means "the quantity of the effort
by which a body, when enduring
violence from without, resists compression,
traction, or any other alteration
of its molecular structure."
This effort proceeds, not from inertia,
but from the active powers residing
in the molecules of the body;
and yet it has received the name of
<i lang="la">vis inertiæ</i>, because it develops itself
in the lapse of time during which
the body, <em>inasmuch as inert</em>&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>
incapable of leaving its place before
the whole mass has acquired a
common velocity&mdash;is still loth to
start, and thus compelled to struggle
against the invading body. Philosophers,
by keeping in sight this
definition of <i lang="la">vis inertiæ</i>, will be able
to solve many sophisms of modern
scientific writers.</p>

<p>Again, the weight of a body is
called a <em>force</em>, and is represented by
the product of the mass of the body
into a velocity <em>which it has not</em>, but
which it would acquire through the
action of gravity in a second of
time, if it were free to fall. If the
mass be called <em>M</em>, and the velocity
which it would acquire <em>g</em>, the pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_769" id="Page_769">[Pg 769]</a></span>duct
<em>Mg</em> will represent the weight
of the body. Now, when the body
is at rest on a table, the pressure
exercised by it on the table is said
to be <em>Mg</em>. Does this mean that
<em>the weight</em> of the body acts on the
table? Not at all; for the body
does not act by its weight, which is
not an active power. The truth is
that the table by its resistance prevents
the body from acquiring the
momentum <em>Mg</em>; and since this resistance
of the table must be equal
to the pressure exercised on it by
the body, hence the pressure itself
is also equal to <em>Mg</em>; and thus a
true force&mdash;a quantity of pressure&mdash;is
technically identified with the
weight of the pressing body. This
identification tends to give a false
idea of the nature of the fact, and
therefore should be carefully avoided
in philosophy.</p>

<p>Modern physicists have laughed
at a philosopher of the old school
(Arriaga), who, as late as 1639, "was
troubled to know how, when several
flat weights lie upon one another
on a board, any but the lowest
should exert pressure on the board."
It would have been more prudent
on their part to ask themselves
whether the question was one
which the modern school could answer
at all. If we ask how two
equal weights can exert equal
pressures on the board from <em>unequal</em>
distances, what can they answer?
If they wish to be consistent
with their notions, they can
only answer that "the actions are
transmitted from one weight to another
till they meet the board."
Now, this is a great philosophical
blunder; for actions are accidents,
and therefore cannot travel from
one subject to another. Neither
action nor active power are ever
transmitted; not even movement
is properly transmitted, but only
propagated by a series of successive
exertions from molecule to
molecule. Were we to admit in
philosophy any such transmission,
we would soon be entangled in innumerable
contradictions.</p>

<p>Mechanical work also is often
styled a <em>force</em>, though it is nothing
but the process by which a <em>force</em>
is exhausted. The notion of <em>work</em>
is very simple. A body moving
through space against a continuous
resistance is said <em>to do work</em>. Work
is therefore so much the greater
according as a greater <em>mass</em> measures
a greater <em>space</em> under a greater
<em>resistance</em>; and thus the work which
a given body can perform may be
represented by the product of three
factors, viz., the mass, the mean resistance,
and the space measured.
This is the philosophical and analytical
expression of <em>work</em>; and
mathematicians show that this expression
in all cases (viz., whether
the resistance be constant or variable)
is equal to half the product of
the mass into the square of its initial
velocity. Now the question
comes: Is <em>work</em> a force? It is
not difficult to anticipate the answer.
Since the adoption of the so-called
"living forces," or <i lang="la">vires vivæ</i>,
of Leibnitz, physicists have called
<i lang="la">vis viva</i> the sum of the works of
two conflicting bodies; and consequently
the work done by either of
the two was said to be one-half of
the <i lang="la">vis viva</i>. But, with all the respect
due to the memory of Leibnitz,
I would say that neither the
work nor the so-called <i lang="la">vis viva</i> is
a force in the philosophical sense
of the word. When a mass, <em>M</em>, animated
by a velocity, <em>V</em>, encounters
a resistance and begins its work, its
momentum is <em>MV</em>. This momentum,
while the work is being done,
is gradually reduced till it is finally
destroyed by the resistance. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_770" id="Page_770">[Pg 770]</a></span>
resistance is, therefore, equal to the
momentum <em>MV</em>. But the resistance,
according to the law of impact,
is always equal to the exertion
of the impinging body. And
therefore the amount of the exertion
of the impinging body is also equal
to <em>MV</em>; that is to say, the force by
which the work is done is an ordinary
dynamical force represented by
the usual dynamical momentum,
and not by the amount of the work
done.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>And here I must close this rather
long excursion into the field of mechanics.
But I cannot conclude
without calling the reader's attention
to the reckless tendency of the
phraseology which I have above
criticised. It seems as if the object
of a class of scientific writers
in these late years has been to banish
from science all secondary
causes, no doubt as a preliminary
step (in the intention of the most
advanced among them) for the banishment
of the First Cause itself.
The words <em>cause</em>, <em>power</em>, <em>force</em>, and
others of the same kind, have indeed
been maintained, as they
could not be easily dispensed with;
but they receive a new interpretation:
they have become "kinds of
motion," and have been identified
with the phenomena&mdash;that is, with
the effects themselves. Thus "movement"
is now everything; its
boasted "indestructibility" makes
it independent of all secondary
causes; and we are told that the
existence of "essential causes" can
no longer be proved by the phenomena,
and that "science" has
the right to reject them as metaphysical
dreams. Let us hear Mr.
Grove again:</p>

<p>"Though the term (force) has a
potential meaning, to depart from
which would render language unintelligible,
we must guard against
supposing that we know essentially
more of the phenomena by saying
that they are produced by something,
which something <em>is only a
word</em> derived from the constancy
and similarity of the phenomena
we seek to explain by it" (p. 18).</p>

<p>And again: "The most generally
received view of causation&mdash;that
of Hume&mdash;refers to invariable antecedence&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>
we call that a cause
which invariably precedes, that an
effect which invariably succeeds"
(p. 10).</p>

<p>And again: "It seems questionable
not only whether cause and
effect are convertible terms with
antecedence and sequence, but
whether, in fact, cause does precede
effect.... The attraction which
causes iron to approach the magnet
is simultaneous with, and ever accompanies,
the movement of the
iron" (p. 13). Yet he adds: "Habit
and the identification of thoughts
with phenomena so compel the use
of recognized terms that we cannot
avoid the use of the word
'cause,' even in the sense to which
objection is taken; and if we
struck it out of our vocabulary, our
language, in speaking of successive
changes, would be unintelligible to
the present generation" (<em>ib.</em>)</p>

<p>And lastly: "In all phenomena,
the more closely they are investigated,
the more are we convinced that,
humanly speaking, neither matter
nor force can be created or annihilated,
and that <em>an essential cause is
unattainable</em>. Causation is the will,
creation the act, of God" (p. 218).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_771" id="Page_771">[Pg 771]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not Mr. Grove alone that
entertains such views; I might
quote other English authors, and
many German, Italian, French, and
American writers whose opinions
are even more extravagant. But a
theory which pretends to ignore
efficient causality, no matter how
loudly trumpeted by scientific periodicals,
no matter how pompously
dressed in scientific books, no matter
how constantly inculcated from
professorial chairs, in the long run
is sure to fail. It bears in itself
and in its very phraseology its
own condemnation. It is vain to
pretend to explain away its inconsistencies
by alleging that "the habits
of the present generation compel
the use of recognized terms;"
the simple truth is that the abettors
of modern thought reap in
their inconsistencies the reward of
their vanity. Mankind will never
consign created causality to the
region of dreams, and we would
remind our scientific friends who
have not received a thorough
philosophical training of the old
adage, "Let the cobbler stick to
his last."</p>

<h3>GRAPES AND THORNS.</h3>


<p class="center">BY THE AUTHOR OF "THE HOUSE OF YORKE."
</p>


<h4>CHAPTER IX.<br />

THE VERDICT.</h4>

<p>The arrest was made in September;
in November the trial came
on. It would have been earlier,
but that witnesses were to be summoned
from England. It was understood
in Crichton that everything
was very soon to be in readiness,
and that the trial would be a
short one; one side announcing confidently
a speedy acquittal, the other
intimating, by a grave but equally
confident silence, their belief in a
speedy conviction.</p>

<p>"Dear Mother Chevreuse!" sighed
Honora Pembroke, who trembled
with terror and apprehension
as the day drew near, "how far
from your heart is all this bitterness!
How far from your wish it
would have been to see a man
hunted like a beast of prey, even if
he had done you a wrong! How
far from your peace is all this excitement!"</p>

<p>Far, indeed, would such an inquisition,
however necessary to the
ends of justice and the good of
society, have been from that sweet
and overflowing heart, where love,
when it could not make the wandering
steps seem to be searching
for the right path, uprose like a
flood, and washed out those traces
of error from remembrance. Far
enough, too, was all this trouble
from the changing form that had
once held so much goodness. One
might guess how Nature had taken
back to her motherly bosom the
clay she had lent for mortal uses,
and was slowly fitting it, by her
wondrous alchemy, for immortality;
purifying the dross from it, brightening
the fine gold. While this
tumult went on overhead, the crumbling
dust of that temple whose
ruin had brought such sorrow and
disaster was slowly and sweetly
going on its several paths to perfection;
stealing into violets, into
roses, into humble grass-blades, into
mists that gathered again in drops
to refresh its own blossoms and
foliage!</p>

<p>Who can say what countless
shapes of constantly aspiring loveliness
the dust of the saint may
assume before uniting once more
and for ever to form that glorified
body which is to hold, without imprisoning,
the beatified spirit, and
transmit without stain the sunshine
of the Divine Presence?</p>

<p>Yes; far enough from such a
progress was the feverish trouble
resulting from this sudden and violent
dissolution. Friends went to
cover anew with flowers and green
that grave over which the snows
of coming winter had let fall a
pure and shining mantle; but the
tears they shed were bitter, and
their flowers withered in the frost.
Voices of those she loved recalled
her virtues, and repeated her wise
and tender sayings; but they, like
all the world, found it easier to admire
than to imitate. At humble
firesides, where families gathered
at night, shivering half with cold
and half with fear, they blessed and
mourned the hand that had helped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_773" id="Page_773">[Pg 773]</a></span>
them and the voice that had
sympathized with and encouraged;
but their blessing was so encumbered
with human selfishness that
it cast the shadow of a malediction.
Pure indeed must be that
love in whose footprints hatred
never lurks!</p>

<p>On the day the trial began F.
Chevreuse lost courage. More fatigued
by constant physical labor
than he would own, he was still
more exhausted in mind. A devouring
anxiety had taken possession
of him. If he was less sure of
Mr. Schöninger's innocence than
he had been, no one knew it. Probably
he entertained no doubt on
that subject. But he was certainly
less confident that the accused
would be able to free himself entirely
from suspicion. He could
no longer be ignorant of the fact
that there was a very damaging
array of testimony against him.</p>

<p>"I must be allowed to be childish
for once, if it is childishness,"
he said. "I cannot perform my
duties till this is over. If a priest
is needed, go to F. O'Donovan.
Don't let any one come near me
but Mr. Macon. Above all things,
don't let any woman in."</p>

<p>We pardon this last request of F.
Chevreuse, for he was not in the
habit of speaking slightingly of women;
and it must be owned that few
of them have the gift of silence or of
ceasing to speak when they have no
more to say.</p>

<p>Mr. Macon was precisely the
friend he needed in these circumstances&mdash;quick-sighted,
clear-headed,
prompt, and taciturn. He was,
moreover, a man of influence, and
could obtain information in advance
of most persons.</p>

<p>"Make yourself quite easy, F.
Chevreuse," he said. "You shall
know everything of consequence
within ten minutes after it has happened
in the court-room."</p>

<p>The gentleman had in his pocket
a package of small envelopes, all
directed plainly to F. Chevreuse,
and each one containing a slip of
paper. When he seated himself in
the court-room, a boy stood beside
him ready to run with his messages.</p>

<p>In the priest's house, F. Chevreuse
had shut himself into his
mother's room. A bright fire burned
on the hearth, the sun shone in
through the eastern window, and at
the other side could be seen a window
of the church with the cipher
of the Immaculate Mother, white
and gold-colored, in the arch of it,
sparkling as if it had just been traced
there by Our Lady herself. All
was still, the length of the house
being between him and the street,
so that only a faint hum of life
reached his ears.</p>

<p>"It is hard to believe that misfortune
is to come again," he muttered,
glancing at the quiet brightness
of the scene. "And I will not believe
it. I will not think of it. In
the name of God, all vain and evil
thoughts begone!"</p>

<p>He drew a table near the fire,
placed several books on it, and,
seating himself, began in earnest to
translate a book which he had been
fitfully at work upon in the brief
pauses of nearer duties. It was a
relief to him to look thus into the
mind of another, and escape a
while from his own. "I am fortunate
in having this to do," he
thought, looking at the bright side
of the situation.</p>

<p>The habit of concentrating his
thoughts on the subject in hand
did much for him; and when Mr.
Macon's first message arrived, it
found him bending with interest
over the written page whereon he
had rendered well a happy thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_774" id="Page_774">[Pg 774]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is better than the original,"
he said to himself. "The
English is a large, loose-jointed
language, sprawling slightly, but it
is a sprawling Titan. It is rich and
strong. For such a work as this,
the French is a trifle too natty and
crisp. Come in!"</p>

<p>The door opened, and his messenger
stood there. Instantly all
rushed across the priest's mind
again. He stretched his hand for
the note the boy offered him, and
tore it hastily open. It was short:</p>

<p>"Nothing but preliminaries so
far. The court sits again at two
o'clock."</p>

<p>F. Chevreuse glanced at the
clock, and saw that it was already
noon. Two hours had passed like
ten minutes while his mind was
thus abstracted.</p>

<p>"Were there many people about
the court-house?" he asked.</p>

<p>The boy had been instructed to
give his notes without saying anything,
and to speak only when spoken
to; but he had not been told
how much to say when he was spoken
to. The temptation to relate
what he had seen was irresistible.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, father," he said, his
eyes glistening with excitement.
"There was such a crowd that I
could hardly get out. I had to
hold up the letter, and say it was
for you. Then they made way."</p>

<p>F. Chevreuse dropped his eyes,
and his face grew more troubled.
"Mr. Schöninger was not in court?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"No, sir!" The boy hesitated,
and had evidently something more
to say.</p>

<p>"Well?" said the priest.</p>

<p>"Somebody threw a crucifix in
at his cell-window to-day, and he
broke it up and threw it out again,"
the messenger said eagerly.</p>

<p>The priest's face blushed an angry
red. "Have they no more reverence
for the crucifix than to use
it as a means of insult, and expose
it in turn to be insulted?" he exclaimed.
"Was it done by a Catholic?
Do you know who did it?"</p>

<p>F. Chevreuse was putting on his
overcoat and searching for his hat,
to the great terror of the indiscreet
tale-bearer.</p>

<p>"I don't know who did it," he
stammered. "I guess it was some
boys. But that was this morning;
and now the police drive everybody
away from that side of the jail. I
am sure they won't do such a thing
again, father."</p>

<p>The priest perceived the boy's
distress in spite of his own preoccupation.
"Never mind, Johnny," he
said kindly, and tried to smile as
he laid his hand on that young
head. "You did no harm in telling
me; I ought to know if such
things happen. Come, I am going
out, and our roads are the same for
a little way. You are going to dinner?
Well, thank your father for
me, and say that I shall go only to
the jail, and directly home again."</p>

<p>"And what has he gone to the
jail for?" Mr. Macon inquired in
surprise when he received this
message from his son.</p>

<p>The boy answered truthfully
enough, but with a somewhat guilty
conscience, that he did not know,
and sat down to his dinner, which
he was unable to eat. His round
cheeks were burning like live coals
with excitement, and his heart was
trembling with the thought that it
was he who had sent the priest on
that errand.</p>

<p>"You must learn to bear excitement
better, my son," the mother
said. "It will never do for you to
be in court every day, if it is going
to make you lose your appetite."</p>

<p>Thus admonished, Johnny called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_775" id="Page_775">[Pg 775]</a></span>
back his courage. "Oh! I'm not
excited at all, mother," he said,
with a fine air of carelessness. "It
is only that I am not hungry. Why,
all the men in the court-house, except
the judge, were more excited
than I was; weren't they, father?"</p>

<p>The father and mother exchanged
a glance and smile. They were
rather pleased with the self-confidence
of this doughty young lad of
theirs.</p>

<p>Meantime, F. Chevreuse had
reached the jail, and learned that
the story he had heard was quite
true. Some boys, encouraged, it
was thought, by their elders, had
flung a crucifix into the Jew's cell-window,
which was not far from
the ground, and it had been tossed
out to them, broken in two. The
prisoner had complained that missiles
were being thrown in, when
the police had received instructions
to keep the place clear.</p>

<p>"I have not allowed any visitors
in the corridor for several days,"
the jailer said. "People crowded
here by scores. But you, of course,
can always go in. They are just
carrying in the dinner."</p>

<p>"I am not sure that I wish to
speak to him," the priest said with
hesitation, but after a moment followed
into the corridor. The
waiter set the tin dishes containing
food into the different cells, through
a hole in the door, and retired.
The jailer stood near the outer
door. F. Chevreuse approached
Mr. Schöninger's cell, not with the
eager confidence of his first visit,
but with an apprehension which he
could not overcome. Other footsteps
prevented his own from being
heard, and he stood at the grating,
unseen and unsuspected by the inmate
of the cell.</p>

<p>Mr. Schöninger sat on the side
of his bed, his face partly turned
from the door, looking steadfastly
out through the window. A silent
snow had begun to fall, tossed
hither and thither by the wind.
The jail was near the Immaculate
Conception, F. Chevreuse's new
church, and the stone Christ that
crowned the summit of the church
was directly opposite the window
of the cell. It stood there above
the roof of the building, with the
sky for a background, its arms outstretched,
and now, in the storm,
seemed to be the centre toward
which all the anger of the elements
was directed. The myriad flakes,
tumbling grayly down, like flocks
of rebel angels being cast out of
heaven, buffeted the compassionate
face as they passed, and, after falling,
seemed to rise again for one
more blow. They rushed from
east, west, north, and south, to cast
their trivial insult at that sublime
and immortal patience. A small
bird, weary-winged, nestled into
the outstretched hand, and the
wind, twirling the snow into a lash,
whipped it out, and sent it fluttering
to the ground. Nothing was
visible through the window but
that solitary form in mid-air stretching
out its arms through the storm.</p>

<p>On that Mr. Schöninger's gaze
was immovably set, and his face
seemed more pale and cold than
the stone itself. His hands were
folded on his knees, the rising of
the chest as he breathed was
scarcely perceptible, and not a
muscle of the closely-shut mouth
stirred. His large, clear eyes, and
the eyelids that trembled now and
then, alone relieved the almost painful
fixedness of his position.</p>

<p>Whether, absorbed in his own affairs,
the direction his eyes took
was merely accidental, or whether
the statue itself had drawn and
held that earnest regard, was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_776" id="Page_776">[Pg 776]</a></span>
easy to decide. But a Catholic,
ever ready to believe that images,
whose sole purpose is, for him, to
recall the mind to heavenly contemplations,
will suggest holy
thoughts even to unbelievers, must
also necessarily hope that no eyes
will for a moment rest on them in
entire unconsciousness.</p>

<p>F. Chevreuse, after one glance,
drew noiselessly back. Mr. Schöninger's
strong and resolute calmness,
which hid, he knew not what,
of inner tumult or repose, disconcerted
him. Besides, he had not
forgotten that those white hands,
so gently folded now, had within
a few hours broken in pieces the
symbol of man's salvation, and
flung them from him in scorn.
He would offer no explanations
nor assurances to one who seemed
so little in need of them. Sighing
heavily, he turned away, and
sought refuge again in his own
home.</p>

<p>Yet a faint gleam of light had
penetrated his sombre mood from
this visit, and, when he had closed
the door of his room, he stepped
hastily to the window looking toward
the church, and glanced up
at the statue above him. It had
been wrought in Italy, and brought
to America in the good ship <em>Cometa</em>,
and had on the voyage come near
being thrown overboard to lighten
the ship during a storm. Bales
and barrels of merchandise had
gone by the board, costly oils had
floated on the waves, costly wines
had perfumed them, but the heaviest
thing in all the freight, the stone
Christ, had been left undisturbed
in spite of the sailors. The captain
was a rough man, and cared
little for any form of religion; but
somewhere within his large, rude
nature was hidden, like a chapel in
a rock, a little nook still bright and
fresh with his youth and his mother's
teachings.</p>

<p>"If Jesus Christ did really walk
on the sea without sinking, then he
can keep this image of himself from
sinking, and us with it," he said.
"I'll put it to the test. If the ship
goes down, I'll never believe in any
of those old stories again."</p>

<p>And he held to his resolution
through a terrific storm, in spite of
a crew on the brink of mutiny, and
finally sailed into port with the sacred
image, which had, he believed,
miraculously preserved them. And
ever after, as they sailed, a little
image of Christ sailed with them,
fixed in the bows; and at night,
during storms at sea, the sailors, albeit
no Catholics, would bow their
heads in passing it, and mutter a
word of prayer for aid; and one
old sailor, to whom for thirty years
the land had been strange and the
sea a home, used to tell how, on
one terrible night of that long storm
when the stone Christ had been
their sole freight left, the crew, lashed
to mast and spar, and looking
every moment for destruction, had
seen a white form glide forth from
the hold, and, standing in the bows,
stretch out its hands over the waves,
which, with the gale, sank away to
silence before them, leaving only
the gentle breeze that had wafted
them on their way home.</p>

<p>"I leave him to you, O shadow
of my Lord!" the priest said.
"Speak to him! call him so that he
cannot resist you!"</p>

<p>He then returned to his work,
somewhat relieved. "No trial is
insupportable to him who has
faith," he thought. "And may be
all this trouble has come upon him in
order that he might lift his eyes and
behold that Christ whom he has denied
standing with arms outstretched
to receive him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_777" id="Page_777">[Pg 777]</a></span></p>

<p>But notwithstanding this faint
comfort, the second message did
not find F. Chevreuse so absorbed
as the first had. He could with
difficulty command his thoughts,
and was constantly lifting his head
to listen for an approaching step,
or starting at a fancied knock at
the door.</p>

<p>Near the close of the afternoon
the boy came, when the light was so
dim that the note could be read
only by taking it to the window.</p>

<p>"They have opened the case a
long way off," Mr. Macon wrote.
"They have proved that Mr. Schöninger
has a lawsuit in England
which involves a large fortune. It
costs him every dollar he can raise,
his opponents being an established
family of wealth and influence, who
have for years been in possession
of the property he claims. They
have proved that during the year
ending last April his lawyers received
from him fifteen hundred dollars
in quarterly payments, and that in
April they wrote that, without larger
advances of money, it would be impossible
for them to carry on the
claim. In May, then, he sent them
five hundred dollars, in June five
hundred more, and on the first of
September a thousand dollars. That
closes the business for this afternoon."</p>

<p>"And what is the impression
made?" F. Chevreuse asked Mr.
Macon, when that gentleman called
on him in the evening.</p>

<p>"The impression, or rather the
conviction, is that Mr. Schöninger
was in a condition to make a man
desperate in his wish for money.
An immense fortune might be secured
by expending a few thousands
then, and would certainly be lost if
he had not the few thousands.
They brought in a crowd of small
tattlers to show that about the time
he received this letter, and after, he
was in great distress and agitation
of mind; that he lost his appetite,
and was heard walking to and fro
in his chamber at night. Furthermore,
it is evident that the money
was obtained in some way after the
first of May, though it was not all
sent at that time. People naturally
ask where the money came from,
since he was not known to have any
in bank, and was supposed to have
sent before all he earned above
what was necessary for him to live
on."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" said F. Chevreuse
pityingly. "What a trouble
there was all the time under that
calm exterior! For I never saw
him otherwise than calm. Why,
people might comment on my walking
my room at night. I frequently
walk so when I am thinking, and
always when I say my beads."</p>

<p>"I do not imagine that Mr. Schöninger
was saying his beads," Mr.
Macon said rather dryly. "He
was undoubtedly in trouble. He
certainly had always an air of calmness,
but to my mind it was not an
air of contentment. He gave me
the impression of a person who has
some secret locked up in his mind.
This affair of the contested inheritance
explains it."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" F. Chevreuse said
again, and leaned back in his chair.
"He has got to have all his private
affairs dragged up for discussion,
and his looks and actions commented
on by the curious. That is
the worst of such a trial. A man
fancies that he has been living a
quiet, private life, and he finds that
he has all the time been in a glass
case with everybody watching him.
The simplest things are distorted,
and a mountain is built up out of
nothing, and that without any wrong
intention either, but simply by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_778" id="Page_778">[Pg 778]</a></span>
curiosity and misconceptions of
people."</p>

<p>Mr. Macon said nothing. He
respected the priest's charity, but,
for himself, he reserved his decision
till the judge should have pronounced.
He was not enthusiastic
for Mr. Schöninger, nor prejudiced
against him; he simply waited to
see what would be proved, and had
no doubt that the truth would triumph.</p>

<p>On the second day the trial progressed
rapidly, approaching a vital
point. Mr. Schöninger had not
slept the night before the death of
Mother Chevreuse, but had been
heard walking and moving about
his room till morning. Miss Carthusen,
whose chamber was next
his, gave this piece of information,
and added that the next morning
the prisoner looked very pale, and
scarcely tasted his breakfast. She
spoke with evident reluctance, and
subjoined an explanation which had
not been asked. "I noticed and
remembered it, because I had heard
of his suit in England, and was
afraid it might be going against
him."</p>

<p>She glanced nervously at the prisoner,
and met a look wherein a
softer ray seemed to penetrate the
searching coldness. Perhaps he was
touched to learn that one for whom
he had cared so little had, without
his suspecting it, sympathized with
him, and been kindly observant of
his ways.</p>

<p>On being questioned, she said
that Mr. Schöninger had not come
home the next night. They had
expected him, because he usually
told them when he was to be absent;
but did not think very strange of it,
as he was due early the next day at
the town of Madison, where he went
every week to give lessons, and
where he sometimes went overnight.
The last she saw of him that night
was at Mrs. Ferrier's. They had a
rehearsal there, and he had excused
himself early, saying that he had an
engagement, and left alone before
any of the company.</p>

<p>Being further questioned, she admitted
having seen that he took
with him from his boarding-house
the shawl that he habitually wore
on chilly evenings.</p>

<p>A shawl was shown her, and she
was asked if she recognized it.</p>

<p>"It was not easy to recognize any
one among all the gray shawls there
were in the world," she replied rather
flippantly, "but Mr. Schöninger's
was like that; she should think
it might be his."</p>

<p>As she went out, the witness
passed quite near the prisoner, and
looked at him imploringly; but he
took no notice of her. She paused
an instant, then, bursting into tears,
hurried out through the crowd,
clinging to the arm of her adopted
father. Lily Carthusen found herself
far more deeply involved than
she had intended. In a moment
of pique and jealousy she had entertained
and encouraged this accusation,
and even insinuated that
she could tell some things if she
would; but it was one thing to suspect
privately, and make peevish
boasts which attracted to her the
attention she so dearly loved, and
quite another to face the terrible
reality where a man was being tried
for his life and she swearing against
him.</p>

<p>Yet even while grieving over her
haste, and repenting it after a fashion,
her anger rose again at the
remembrance of that cold glance
which had averted itself from her
when all in the court-room could
have seen that she mutely begged
his pardon for what she had been
obliged to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_779" id="Page_779">[Pg 779]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope this will teach you to
guard your tongue a little," her
father said in deep vexation, as he
extricated her from the throng.
"It's about the last place for a
lady to come to. And, moreover, I
hope it will cure you of concerning
yourself about the pale looks and
bad appetite of young men who do
not trouble themselves about you."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, papa," says Miss
Lily; "since I've had a bad time,
be sure you add a scolding to it.
It's the way with you men."</p>

<p>Mr. Carthusen wisely kept silence.
He had learned before this
that the young woman who called
him father had a remarkable talent
for retort.</p>

<p>Where, then, did Mr. Schöninger
spend the night the priest's house
was entered? Not in Madison;
for he had driven himself there
early in the morning. He had
waked a stable-keeper at four
o'clock in the morning to give him
a horse and buggy to drive to Madison.
The man had wondered at
the prisoner taking so early a start,
even if he had to begin his lessons
at eight o'clock, and had thought
that something was the matter with
him. He looked pale; and several
times, while harnessing the horse,
the witness had glanced up and
seen him shivering, as if with cold,
though it was a beautiful May
morning. Mr. Schöninger had
seated himself on a bench near the
stable-door while waiting, and leaned
his arms on his knees, looking
down, and had not uttered a word
before driving away, except to say
that he would be back at seven
o'clock in the evening. He looked
like a man who had been up all
night.</p>

<p>Being questioned, the witness
testified that the prisoner wore at
the time he saw him in the morning
a large gray shawl, such as gentlemen
wear; and, on still further
questioning, he said that he had
observed there was a little piece
torn out of one corner. He had
noticed and remembered this, because
the shawl hung over the
wheel when Mr. Schöninger started,
and he had stopped him to tuck it
up. His first passing thought had
been that it was a pity to injure a
new shawl; his second, on seeing
the torn corner, that, after all, the
shawl was not a new one. He
would not, perhaps, have remembered
such trivial circumstances
but for what he heard immediately
after. Some one came in and told
him of Mother Chevreuse's death.
It occurred to him that Mr. Schöninger
must have heard of it already,
and that it was that news
which had made him so sober and
silent. He recollected, too, having
heard that F. Chevreuse and the
Jew were quite great friends, but
that the priest's mother did not like
they should have any intercourse.
He had observed, too, that Mr.
Schöninger's boots were muddy,
and wondered at it a little, as the
roads were not bad, and as the
prisoner had always been nice in
his dress.</p>

<p>When Mr. Macon visited F.
Chevreuse the evening of the second
day, he found the priest looking
quite haggard.</p>

<p>"You have written me the bad,
and the worst of the bad," he exclaimed
the moment the door was
shut on them. "There must be
something to counterbalance all
this nonsense!"</p>

<p>"On the contrary, there is something
to add," Mr. Macon replied.
"Johnny couldn't get through the
crowd at the last. They would
not make way for him."</p>

<p>"Well?" the priest asked sharply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_780" id="Page_780">[Pg 780]</a></span></p>

<p>They had seated themselves before
the fire, and the red light of
it shone up into one face turned
sideways, and full of shrinking inquiry
as it looked into the other
face, whose downcast eyes seemed
to shun being so read.</p>

<p>"Mr. Schöninger was somewhere
wandering about the city all that
night," Mr. Macon said. "He was
seen and recognized by two or
three persons, all of whom noticed
something odd in his manner. He
was seen in the lane back of the
house here as late as eleven o'clock,
and appeared to be going toward
the river, but came back to the
street on finding himself observed.
He was not at his boarding-house
nor at any of the hotels that night.
Moreover, the measure taken of the
tracks near your house corresponds
with the size of the boots he wore."</p>

<p>"I don't want to hear any
more!" exclaimed F. Chevreuse
passionately, and hid his face in
his hands.</p>

<p>His companion glanced quickly
at him, then looked into the fire,
and remained silent.</p>

<p>After a moment, the priest lifted
his face.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say that
the case is going against him?" he
asked in a low voice that expressed
both fear and incredulity.</p>

<p>"It looks a little like that now,"
was the quiet reply. "But we do
not know what to-morrow may bring
forth."</p>

<p>"I believe Jane was called to-day?"
F. Chevreuse remarked after
a moment.</p>

<p>The other nodded his head.</p>

<p>"I hope she behaved well?" he
added painfully.</p>

<p>Another nod. "Yes; as well as
one could expect her to."</p>

<p>"The Ferriers, too, and Lawrence?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but their testimony was
not of any great consequence."</p>

<p>The testimony of the Ferrier family
was, however, entirely favorable
to the prisoner, and they had
mentioned him with such respect
and kindness as to visibly affect
him, and to create a sort of diversion
in his favor. The wealth and
style of the party, the manner in
which they took possession, as it
were, of the court-room, with several
gentlemen clearing the path before
them, made an impression.
When they went out, the prisoner
looked at them with a faint smile
as they passed. Annette smiled in
return, and Lawrence bowed with
scrupulous respect and friendliness;
but Mrs. Ferrier, rustling in
voluminous silks, down which her
rich sables slipped loosely, leaned
over the bar, and, in the face of
the whole court and crowd of spectators,
shook hands with Mr. Schöninger,
and, in a voice audible to
the whole company, made with him
an appointment which hovered
strangely between the tragical and
the absurd.</p>

<p>"Come to my house the minute
you are out of this terrible place,"
she said. "Don't go anywhere
else." Then she flounced out, wiping
her eyes, and tossing her head
disdainfully at the judge, the lawyers,
and the crowd, whom she
held to be, severally and collectively,
to blame for these unjust and
impertinent proceedings.</p>

<p>"You know, mamma," Annette
said, "the judge has to listen to
everybody, and it isn't his fault if
people are accused. And Mr. Wilson
is obliged to make out his case,
if he can, and to ask a great many
questions. Some things that seem
to us trivial may have a good deal
of importance in a case like this.
You must remember that a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_781" id="Page_781">[Pg 781]</a></span>law-court
is quite different from a
drawing-room, where people cannot
be too inquisitive without being
checked."</p>

<p>"I shall take care that none of
them come to my drawing-room
again," retorted the mother with
spirit. "To think of that Mr. Wilson,
who has been at my house to
dinner, telling me to try to remember
something that he knew I had
forgotten or didn't want to tell!
You may depend upon it, Annette,
that man has a spite against poor
Mr. Schöninger. It is as plain as
day that he is raking up all he can
against him. I shouldn't be surprised
if the scamp were to hire
men to tell lies about him. He
looks capable of it. And then, to
question me about what Mr. Schöninger
had over his shoulder when
he came to my house, and what
time it was when he went away,
and to show me that trumpery old
gray shawl&mdash;if that is the majesty
of the law, I don't want to see any
more majesty. The object&mdash;and a
most ridiculous and slanderous object
it is, too&mdash;is to find out if
Mr. Schöninger, as fine a gentleman
as ever lived, broke into a
priest's house, and murdered a
lady and a saint, and stole a little
package of dirty one-dollar bills.
That's what they pretend to want
to find out; and why don't they
find it out in the proper way? It
needn't take 'em long, I should
think. But no! they must poke
their noses into people's private
affairs, asking every kind of impudent
question, and making you say
things twice, and then asking if
you are sure, and then telling you
that it's no matter what your opinion
is about things; as if I hadn't
a right to an opinion! They want
to make money, and dawdle out a
case as long as they can&mdash;that's
what they want. And as for the
curiosity of women, it's nothing!
It takes a man to cross-question."</p>

<p>"O mamma, mamma!" sighed
Annette, with smiling indulgence.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes; it's always 'O mama!'"
exclaimed Mrs. Ferrier excitedly.
"But I have common
sense, for all that. And if I'd had
the slightest idea how they were
going to act, I would have thought
out a good story before I came,
and stuck to it through thick and
thin."</p>

<p>"Why, mamma!" cried the
daughter in dismay, "you were
sworn to tell the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth.
If you had said anything else, you
would have committed perjury."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ferrier looked at her daughter
in astonishment not unmingled
with alarm. "I didn't swear any
such thing," she said, the tide of
her eloquence somewhat checked.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, mamma, we all took
the oath. When we held up our
hands and kissed the book, that
was the time."</p>

<p>"I never uttered a word," averred
the mother with decision.</p>

<p>"But the clerk said the words
for us, mamma, and we held up our
hands to denote, I suppose, that we
acceded to all he said."</p>

<p>"I heard him mumble over something,
I didn't know what it was,"
said the lady slightingly. "And so
somebody else swears for you, like
sponsors at a baby's baptism! Well,
if he does the swearing, then the
perjury is his."</p>

<p>"Good gracious, mamma!" cried
Annette, "I hope you haven't been
telling any lies!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ferrier looked at her daughter
in dignified reproof. "No, Annette;
I'm not in the habit of telling
lies, and I haven't told any to-day.
And I hope I haven't told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_782" id="Page_782">[Pg 782]</a></span>
any truths about that poor struggling
creature, who is, for all the
world, like a sheep among wolves.
I could never bear to see even a
wolf hunted, much less a man."</p>

<p>The three were driving home,
Lawrence seated opposite the
ladies. While Mrs. Ferrier was
talking, he leaned forward, with his
arms on his knees, and softly
smoothed the fur border of her
velvet mantle. He had those little
caressing ways when any one pleased
him. A faint smile now and
then touched his lips at some simple
or energetic expression of hers, but
his face was so averted that she did
not see it, and it would appear that
her simplicity did not displease,
though it might amuse him a little.</p>

<p>Presently he relinquished the
mantle border, and began, with delicate
approach, to touch the wrist lets,
stroking the dark fur softly,
and pushing his finger-tips into it;
and at length, when her attention,
fluttering abstractedly toward him
now and then, had become fixed on
him, and she held herself still, and
looked, with a half-surprised smile
of pleasure, to see what sweet and
childish thing he was doing, he
took her two plump and well-gloved
hands in his, and looked up at
his wife. "There's no danger of
her telling anything but the truth,
Annette," he said. "She is too
good and honest for anything else."
And he actually bent his handsome
head, and kissed Mrs. Ferrier's
hands, first one then the other!</p>

<p>There was a momentary silence.
Annette, startled by this unexpected
delight, could only look at her
husband with tearful, shining eyes.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Annette, she doesn't
make half as many mistakes as&mdash;as
I do, for instance."</p>

<p>He dropped his face, relinquished
the hands he had kissed, and began
again to play with the border of
Mrs. Ferrier's cloak, leaving the
two women to their talk.</p>

<p>But we have left F. Chevreuse
and Mr. Macon.</p>

<p>"That hateful shawl, who raked
that out?" the priest asked after a
while, questioning in spite of himself.</p>

<p>"The whole turns upon that,"
Mr. Macon said, rousing himself
from the brown-study into which
he had fallen. "It seems that Miss
Carthusen went up to the convent
to make the acquaintance of the
Sisters, and, while there, saw a
shawl thrown over a lounge in the
parlor. She examined it while
waiting for the Sisters to come in,
and found the corner torn. She
mentioned the fact to that Renford,
who is an amateur detective. The
fellow's great ambition is to become
a second Vidocq; he immediately
offered to undertake the case, with
the provision that, if he should succeed
in finding the criminal, he
should be regularly employed as a
detective."</p>

<p>"Where did the Sisters get the
shawl?" demanded F. Chevreuse.
"Have they got to be dragged in?"</p>

<p>"It would seem that everybody is
to be dragged in," Mr. Macon said.
"My wife got the shawl, she doesn't
know where, when she was collecting
for the convent. That is, they
say that she brought it; though she
cannot recollect any person giving
her such an article, nor recollect
even having seen it among the
packages. But her carriage was
piled full that day, and she had
called, perhaps, at twenty houses;
so it would not be strange if she
should forget."</p>

<p>"So those poor nuns have had to
go into court!" said F. Chevreuse,
much distressed by the news.
"Which one went?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_783" id="Page_783">[Pg 783]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! it wasn't a Sister; it was
Anita," said Mr. Macon. "My
wife went with the child, and stood
by her all the time. It was Anita
who took all the things from the
carriage while my wife was talking
with Sister Cecilia in the garden;
and the girl counted and examined
every package."</p>

<p>"She must have been terrified to
death, that poor little lamb!" exclaimed
F. Chevreuse, rising to
walk about the room. "I think I
should have been there with her.
I would have gone if I had known.
You keep too much from me, Mr.
Macon. I known that you and
others do this from kindness; but
you must remember that it isn't for
me to be cowardly and shrink like a
baby. I'm not sure but I should
feel better to be in the midst of it
all than to be shut up here suffering
the torments of suspense."</p>

<p>"You had a great deal better
have nothing to do with it," his
friend said decidedly. "You are
not needed. F. O'Donovan was in
court with Anita and my wife, and
there was a body-guard of Catholics
all about to make room for them
going and coming. It was hard for
the poor child; but what she felt
most was not being in a crowd, and
obliged to speak in public; she did
not appear to think of that; but the
thought that what she must say
might bring trouble on any one almost
overpowered her. She excited
a great deal of sympathy. While
she spoke, you could have heard a
pin drop in the room."</p>

<p>"After all," F. Chevreuse said,
catching at a consolation, "it won't
hurt any of them to see one of God's
snow-drops; and she is no more
tender than many a martyr of the
church has been."</p>

<p>Mr. Macon's brief story did not
give any idea of the sensation produced
in court by the appearance
of this child, who was as strange to
such a scene as if she had been, indeed,
a wild flower brought from
some profound forest solitude. Her
beauty, the dazzling paleness of her
face, from which the large eyes
looked full of anguish and fear, the
flower-like drooping of her form as
she leaned on Mrs. Macon's supporting
arm&mdash;all startled the most
hardened spectator into sympathy.
Careless and callous as they might
have been, feeding on excitement as
a drunkard takes his draught, ever
stronger and stronger as his taste
becomes deadened, each one seemed
to realize for a moment how terrible
a thing it is to see a human life at
stake, and to have influence to destroy
or to save it. If she had been
a relative or personal friend to the
accused, the impression would have
been less deep; but the fact that
she would have shown the same
painful solicitude for any one of
them may have stirred in their consciences
some sense of their own
heartlessness. They made way for
her, and listened in breathless silence
to hear what she would say.
Her very distress lent a silvery
clearness to her voice, usually so
low and soft, and every word was
heard as plainly as the notes of a
small bird chirping when its nest is
attacked.</p>

<p>"All I know, your honor, is this:
Mrs. Macon drove about Crichton
to ask for things for the convent;
and Mother Ignatia let me go out
to bring in the parcels she brought,
because it pleased me. I always
set down on a slip of paper a list of
the articles, and the day of the
month she brought them, and some
of the Sisters helped me, and looked
on. But this time no one but me
did anything, for it was the day after
Mother Chevreuse was killed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_784" id="Page_784">[Pg 784]</a></span>
everybody was in great trouble.
Mrs. Macon said, when she came,
that she had spent the night before
at Madison with her sister there,
and started early in her phaeton to
beg for us, and had heard nothing
of the news till she reached Crichton
late in the afternoon. Then she
drove straight to us; and, when she
got out of the phaeton, she ran to
Sister Cecilia, and they threw themselves
into each other's arms, and
began to cry. We were all crying,
but I went to take the parcels out
of the phaeton, because I wanted to
do something. And I made a list
of them, because I always had, and
I carried them up-stairs. And I
knew just how everything looked,
because I tried to think of my work
and not of Mother Chevreuse. And
I do know surely that the gray shawl
which was laid over our lounge was
brought that day. I saw the piece
torn out of the corner, and, when
they arranged it for a cover, they
turned the torn corner behind.
That is all, your honor, except that
Miss Carthusen came to the convent
one day, and, when I went into the
parlor, she was examining the shawl,
and she said she did it because there
was one like it missing out of their
house. And I hope," said this simple
creature, rising, in her earnestness,
from Mrs. Macon's arm, and
leaning imploringly toward the
judge&mdash;"I hope that what I have
said will not hurt anybody nor be
used against anybody. And I ask
Mr. Schöninger to forgive me if
what I have said displeases him;
for, if it should do him harm, I
shall be unhappy about it as long
as I live."</p>

<p>No one said a word as the girl
was led, trembling and half fainting,
out of the court-room. The
prisoner regarded her with astonishment
while she spoke, and when
she turned toward him her pitiful
face, and made her appeal for forgiveness,
he bowed, and a slight
involuntary motion of his hands
looked as if he would fain have
supported her drooping form.
Never had he seen so simple and so
impassioned a creature. An angel
taking its first flight out of the
white peacefulness of heaven, and
looking for the first time on the
miseries of earth, could scarcely
have shown a more shrinking and
terrified pity than had been displayed
by this young girl, drawn from
her peaceful convent home to the
arena where crime and justice
struggle for the mastery. And yet
that pure and tender child had
given him a terrible blow. Perhaps
he felt that her testimony was important,
simple as the story she
told seemed to be; for his face grew
deathly pale, and for the first time
during the trial he lost that air of
scornful security which he had sustained
so far. Averting his face
slightly, he seemed to be studying
out some problem, and, as he
thought, the faint lines between his
brows grew deeper, and those sitting
near him could see the veins
in his temples swelling and throbbing
with the stress of some sudden
emotion.</p>

<p>The next morning F. Chevreuse
went out to make sick-calls after
his Mass was over, and returned
quite convinced that his friends
had been right in advising him to
remain in-doors. Everybody he
met gazed at him, as if trying to
read in his face what thought or
feeling he might be striving to hide;
people turned to look after him;
and groups of excited talkers became
silent as he approached, only
to resume their conversation with
increased vehemence when he had
passed. He had been obliged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_785" id="Page_785">[Pg 785]</a></span>
check the wordy sympathy of some
and the angry denunciations of
others, who thought to please him
by wishing ill to Mr. Schöninger;
and more than once his heart had
been wrung by some loud lament
over his lost mother.</p>

<p>"You were right," he said to F.
O'Donovan when he went in. "I
will not go out again unless there is
need of it."</p>

<p>"Then I give you as a task this
forenoon to translate ten pages of
that book," his brother priest replied.
"It is needed, and should
be ready for the early spring sales."</p>

<p>F. Chevreuse laid aside his wrappings
with alacrity, glad to have a
task assigned him. "But I would
like to go into the church a minute,"
he said, making this request
with the humility of a child. "Not
to pray," he added quickly, as if
afraid of receiving too much credit
for piety; "I want to go into the
gable, and look down to the court-house."</p>

<p>He stopped for permission, and
his face was so worn and troubled
that his friend checked the slight
smile that unconscious display of
obedience had provoked.</p>

<p>"Go, by all means, but do not
stay long," he said. "The day is
very cold. And, besides, it will do
no good to watch there."</p>

<p>What he called the gable was a
long, low attic running the whole
length of the church, and lighted
by a small gable window at each
end. A steep stairway led up to
a chamber over the altar; but from
that the ascent was made by long
ladders, very seldom used. The
window over the altar gave a fine
view of all the eastern and northern
part of the city, and looked directly
into the square in front of the
court-house.</p>

<p>F. Chevreuse toiled wearily up,
feeling himself grown old, and stood
in the long, dusky room. The floor
was covered with wood-shavings
left by the builders, and spiders
had hung their webs in thick festoons
from beam to beam. One
side of the southern window, at the
further end of the church, was
gleaming brightly, where the sun
had begun to come in, and the
rafters near it glowed as if kindling
with fire; but the north window,
that felt scarce a touch of sunshine
in the winter-time, was covered
deeply with frost, piled layer on
layer through the cold night.</p>

<p>He put his face to the frame, and
breathed on it till the glittering
coldness melted, and a drop of
water ran down, then another, and
presently there was a clear spot in
the glass. He wiped this dry with
his handkerchief; then, covering
his mouth and nose, that his breath
might not freeze over the improvised
loophole into the outer world,
he leaned closer and looked out.
For the large panorama of the city,
spread out under a clear winter sky,
and shot through by the two sparkling
rivers, he cared not. Only one
spot attracted his attention, and
that was the court-house and the
square in front of it. Looking
there, he drew back, winked to
clear his eyes, which had, perhaps,
been dazzled by the sharp and tangled
lights and shadows of the
place; then looked again. The
square should have been white with
half-trodden snow, and dotted by
passers here and there; instead of
that, it was entirely black. But
the blackness was not of the soil
nor pavement; it was the swaying
blackness of a crowd. They thronged
the streets, pressing toward the
square, and stood on the steps of
the court-house, struggling to enter.
Even at that distance he could see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_786" id="Page_786">[Pg 786]</a></span>
that policemen were forcing them
back.</p>

<p>F. Chevreuse turned hastily away
from the window, and descended to
the church, heartsick at the sight.
He threw himself one moment before
the altar, then went into the
house. As he entered, Jane, who
was on the lookout, hid herself in
her room till he had passed through
the kitchen. Since the trial began,
they had not met. She felt sure
that he did not approve entirely of
her conduct, and he allowed her to
be invisible without asking any
questions.</p>

<p>F. O'Donovan looked at him
anxiously as he re-entered the sitting-room;
and, when he went and
leaned on the mantel-piece, hiding
his face in his hands, approached and
touched him kindly on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"It isn't your way, Raphael, to
break down so," he said in that
sweet voice of his, still sweeter with
pity and tenderness.</p>

<p>That name, the name of his boyhood,
when he and O'Donovan were
at school together; when he was so
overflowing with happiness that he
could never be still, but had to be
for ever at work or at play; when he
knew no more of care than what
the getting of his lessons involved,
no more of sin than the little faults
he recounted at his confessor's
knees and forgot the next moment,
and no more of sorrow than the
changing of one beloved professor
for another who speedily became as
dear. O'Donovan, the beautiful
boy, the youngest at school, had
been his pride and idol in those
days. He turned to him now, and,
in the old way the English boys
used to mock at him for, kissed his
friend and school-fellow on both
cheeks; at which the Irishman
laughed a little and blushed a good
deal.</p>

<p>"You're not much changed from
the boy you were," said F. Chevreuse.
"You had always a way of
seeming to coax, while you were
really commanding. Well, you're
almost always right. How the wind
whistles!"</p>

<p>It was a cutting north wind that
broke multitudinously against the
church, and seemed to splinter
there into separate sharp voices.
They went up from the narrow passage
between the church and the
house, they rang from the chimneys,
and sighed and whimpered about
the feet of the stone Christ, as if
some wounded creature, invisible
to man, had crawled there to seek
for pity.</p>

<p>"What a day!" repeated F.
Chevreuse, looking out. "December
is certainly an ugly month, and
January is a worse one. February
would be worst of all, but that it is
so near spring you can snap your
fingers in its face."</p>

<p>He seated himself at the table,
drew the books towards him, and
glanced round at the fire, as if to
assure himself that there was something
shining in his vicinity, then
took up a pen, and laid it down
again, shivering, not because he
was cold, but because he knew
there was so much cold about.</p>

<p>F. O'Donovan, seated near the
window, with his finger between the
leaves of his Breviary, to keep the
place, had observed his every movement.
He dropped the book on
his knee, and spoke in a gentle,
dreamy way that was the very essence
of soothing.</p>

<p>"Yes, this is now for a while one
of the cold spots on the earth; but
we have only to climb a little, in
spirit or in memory, to have a different
idea of December and everything
else. How many years ago
to-day is it that you and I saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_787" id="Page_787">[Pg 787]</a></span>
oranges ripening in the sun in December,
and roses blooming, and
people pushing back their cloaks
for the heat? It is an anniversary,
for I have some little reason to
remember the date. We were in
Rome. I had been shivering in a
bare, sunless room at the Propaganda,
when I looked up and caught
a glimpse through the window of a
bit of miraculous blue sky over the
roof of San Andrea's. It was four
o'clock in the afternoon, and time
for a walk. I called you, and we
started on a little exploring expedition;
for we had neither of us seen
much of Rome at that time. We
muffled ourselves well, and went
out into the Piazza di Spagna. I
recollect you saying, as we came to
those great stairs, that they must
have been modelled by some one
who had Jacob's dream-ladder in
his mind. You said, too, that one
reason why Rome is so much more
beautiful than any other city is not
because it is more artistic, but more
natural. Each part grew for itself,
instead of being cramped by some
dominating idea that spoilt all in
trying to direct all. You were delighted
with the perfectly cool way
in which a whole street would go
up-stairs or down-stairs. Well,
there was the whole side of a piazza
going up-stairs. We went up, past
the group of models, you know, who
stand there to be stared at; the
bearded old man who stands for S.
Peter or Moses, the brigand and
the brigand's wife, and the little
brown gypsies. The calendar said
it was December; yet in the piazza
below the air said it was April.
When we paused at the first landing,
and began to wish we had left
our cloaks at home, it was May, and
up in front of the Trinita de' Monti
it was mid-June. The fruit-sellers
left their large baskets of oranges
in the sun while they sat in the
shade and waited for customers;
there were baskets of flowers, with
heaps of half-open roses on the
stone rail of the balustrade, and
streams of rich verdure flowed wide
or trickled brightly between the
gray sweeps of stone. In the east
was that unimaginable blue that can
only be compared to a gem; in the
west, a dazzle of unclouded sunshine;
and between the two, Rome
floated in a silvery mist. You
leaned on the balustrade, and&mdash;wretch
that you were!&mdash;your first
thought was a pagan one. You
said that the goddess of beauty had
sunk into the midst of the city, and
left her drapery of cloud clinging
all about it, and that, when she
should withdraw, there would be a
vision in the sky, but Rome would
be nothing but ashes. That was
the best image that Raphael Chevreuse
could find, with the city before
him all a-bubble with the
domes of Christian churches. You
may recollect that I gave you a
very pretty lecture on the subject.
Then you pointed out to me a pillar
of smoke wreathing slowly up into
the sky, showing between the bold
front of the Pincian Hill and the
twin cupolas in the Piazza del Popolo,
with the distant forest and
mountain for a background, and
you said that we were nothing but
cloud-people living in a cloud, and
that the only realities were Moses
and the Israelites out there offering
up sacrifice in the wilds between
Egypt and Chanaan. Well, December
being too hot for us then,
we walked off toward Santa Maria
Maggiore. Do you remember
the great orange-tree, as large
as an apple-tree, that showed over
the convent walls, and how thickly
the golden oranges were set among
its green foliage; and the symbol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_788" id="Page_788">[Pg 788]</a></span>
over the convent door of two lions
trying to get at a bird that was safe
in the top of a palm-tree;<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> and the
vane that you said could have been
thought of nowhere but in Italy&mdash;a
rod with a cross at the top and a
bird's wing swinging round as the
wind changed? And when we
walked on among the ruins, what
superstitious young man gathered
dandelions, because gold-colored
flowers always brought him some
happy chance, he said; and then,
in the next breath, looking at those
mountains before us, swimming, it
seemed, in a sea of rosy-purple vapors,
broke out with a psalm,
"Montes exultaverunt ut arietes;
et colles, sicut agni ovium"? You
declared vehemently that the mountains
were dancing, and I had to
hold you to keep you from dancing
too. A pretty sight it would have
been to see a young Christian priest
twirling <em>pirouettes</em> among the ruins
of the temple of Minerva! Doubtless,
while we are in the midst of
the snows and frost of a northern
morning, the sun is just going down
over that same warm and glowing
scene. And, doubtless, too," said
F. O'Donovan slowly, coming to
the point he had started to reach,
"outside this pain and confusion
there is peace and happiness waiting
to come in and give us our soul's
summer in this world even. The
storms are short, but the peace is
long, and for ever waiting overhead."</p>

<p>"But life is not long," concluded
F. Chevreuse, "and it behooves me
to be about my work."</p>

<p>He drew the books toward him,
and began to work in earnest. He
had been comforted in one regard
that morning: he would not himself
be called into court, the only
points on which he could give
evidence being better known to
others. Jane and Andrew had
both seen the condition of his little
study, with its bolted window and
locked-up desk, after he left the
house that fatal night, and both F.
O'Donovan and Mr. Macon saw it
in the morning before he came
home. The other point, relating
to the sort of bank-bills he had
lost, was of no consequence, as the
bankers could not say what sort of
money Mr. Schöninger had paid
them. Every disposition was shown
to spare him unnecessary pain, and
they even strained a point for that
purpose.</p>

<p>He was not needed, indeed, and
the case was being brought rapidly
to a conclusion, as his first despatch
showed him.</p>

<p>"Old Mr. Grey, from the pond
farm, with his granddaughter, have
been brought in," Mr. Macon
wrote, "and by their help the story
has been made to assume form.
Mr. Schöninger returned to Crichton
that day past their place. He
got into a rough road and broke
his harness somewhere, and went
to their house to borrow a rope to
mend it. He had a shawl on his
arm when he went up to the door.
While the young girl was gone for
the rope, he folded the shawl, and
put it into my wife's phaeton among
the other packages. My wife was
then with old Mrs. Grey in the
house. Mr. Grey was at work in
the garden, and saw what was done.
The girl also saw the shawl on his
arm when he came, but did not notice
it afterward. It is likely to go
hard with him."</p>

<p>F. Chevreuse had a very red face
when he looked over this note.
But he handed it to F. O'Donovan
without a word, and resumed his
writing again. If he knew well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_789" id="Page_789">[Pg 789]</a></span>
what he was writing is doubtful.
That color did not leave his face,
and now and then he pressed his
hand to his forehead, as if confused.</p>

<p>"Mr. Schöninger has roused
himself at last," the next note said.
"He seems for the first time to
comprehend that he is in danger.
He looks like a lion. I hope he
may prove to have some of a lion's
strength, for his chances are small."</p>

<p>F. Chevreuse handed the paper
to his brother priest, who had been
out and come in again, and watched
his face while he read it.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me frankly your
opinion of this?" he said then.</p>

<p>F. O'Donovan dropped his eyes,
having, evidently, no mind to be
frank on the subject. "I cannot
have a settled opinion on a question
of which I have heard but one
side," he said. "I have been in
court this morning, and talked with
some people there, and the chances
at present seem for a conviction.
But we cannot tell the strength of
the defence as yet."</p>

<p>In spite of his reserve, there was
no mistaking his belief in the prisoner's
guilt.</p>

<p>F. Chevreuse shut his book decisively.</p>

<p>"Since I am not needed here, I
may as well go and see the bishop,"
he said. "I was to have gone this
week to settle important business
with him, but he excused me on
the supposition that I would not be
allowed to leave Crichton. Can
you take care of my people a few
days longer?"</p>

<p>"A week longer, if you wish."</p>

<p>"Four days will be enough&mdash;two
to go and come, two there. You
will know where to telegraph for
me, if I should be wanted. I will
go straight to the bishop's house,
and stay there."</p>

<p>"How glad I am that you did
not say 'episcopal residence'!"
remarked his companion.</p>

<p>F. Chevreuse was already making
his preparations for the journey.
He glanced up rather imperiously
from the valise he was packing.</p>

<p>"Why should I say it?" he demanded.
"Never used such an
expression in my life. And this
reminds me that you have been
criticising me before to-day, calling
me superstitious, and I don't know
what else. In one little corner of
my mind I have been thinking the
matter over ever since, and have
arrived at these conclusions: superstition,
being nothing but erratic
faith, should be treated with great
tenderness; and, besides, you will
recollect that I was at that time
reading the pagan classics; furthermore,
Rome herself was not
born in the faith, but is a converted
pagan, and she stands there, a
Christian Juno, with all Olympus
kneeling about her feet; and well
so, for any form is good that is capable
of holding a Christian soul.
Still further, I have concluded that
young O'Donovan, whose hair still
looks, across the room, quite black,
should show a becoming reverence
for Chevreuse, who has long since
ceased to count his white hairs and
begun to count his black ones. I
said an elder soldier, not a better.
Did I say better? Good-by. God
bless you!"</p>

<p>And he was off, glad of the noise
and speed of the cars, of the changing
faces and scenes, of anything
that would help to ease his mind
by a momentary distraction. Yet,
in spite of every effort, the thought
haunted him of Mr. Schöninger
rousing himself to do battle for his
life. Call up whatever image he
would to entertain his mind, that
one intruded. He pictured to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_790" id="Page_790">[Pg 790]</a></span>
himself the first dawn of apprehension
in the prisoner's face rapidly
intensifying to a flash of angry terror,
the reddening or the whitening
color, the gathering storm of the
brows. He tried to guess what he
would do and say, by what grand
effort he would at last fling off in
scorn the accusation which he had
not believed could cling to him&mdash;if
he should be able to fling it off.
That doubt was like a thorn, and
he hastily called to mind something
to banish it. He remembered what
F. O'Donovan had been saying of
Rome, and tried to recollect something
of that old picture-book part
of his life, to see again in fancy its
shady streets and sunny piazzas,
to enter in spirit some dim church
starred around with lamps, and lined
with precious marbles; but when
he had laboriously fashioned the
scene, a hand was outstretched to
put it aside like a painted curtain,
and again he saw the Jewish gladiator,
alive and alert, fighting desperately
for his life.</p>

<p>"You can see that I have run
away to escape disagreeable scenes
and talk," were his first words on
reaching his destination. "And
now to business."</p>

<p>It was quite understood, then,
that no one was to tell him anything
relating to the trial, nor mention the
subject to him; so that when, on the
evening of the third day, he started
for home, he knew no more of the
progress or result of it than he had
known on leaving Crichton.</p>

<p>There were but few passengers
that evening, and F. Chevreuse established
himself in a corner of the
car, put his ticket in his hat-band,
that he might not be disturbed by
the conductor, leaned back and shut
his eyes, that he might not be talked
to by any one else, and took out
his beads to exorcise troublesome
thoughts and invoke holy ones. It
was a saying of his that the beads,
when rightly used, had always one
end fastened to the girdle of Mary,
and were a flowery chain by which
she led the soul directly to the
throne of God.</p>

<p>They proved so to him in this
case, and one after another the Joyful
Mysteries were budding and
blossoming under his touch, when
presently he found himself somewhat
disturbed by the voices of two
men who were talking behind him.
At first the sound reached him
through the long vista of that heavenly
abstraction; but soon the
distance lessened, and then a single
word brought him down with a
shock.</p>

<p>"He fought hard at last," one
said, "but it was of no use. Everything
was against him."</p>

<p>It needed not another word to
tell the priest who and what were
meant; but other words were spoken.</p>

<p>"His defence was a mere mass of
sentimentality," the speaker went
on. "He owns to having walked
the streets the whole night of the
murder, but he says that it was from
distress of mind. He had to decide
before the next day whether he
would abandon all hope of the fortune
for which he was contending,
and lose with it all that he had expended,
or else throw into the chasm
the few hundreds he had retained
that an accident might not find him
penniless. He declared that the
state of his mind was such that he
could not sleep, nor keep still, nor
stay in the house. Now, that part
of the story would not have been
so bad if he had not been seen near
the priest's house, hanging about
there, and going away when he was
observed, and if he had not declared
that, when he went away from Crich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_791" id="Page_791">[Pg 791]</a></span>ton
in the morning, he had not heard
of the murder. The tracks were not
a strong point, for Newcome makes
everybody's boots just alike, and
there are a good many men in
Crichton who have as neat a foot
as Schöninger. But the rest of the
defence was nonsense. The shawl
was what convicted him. It was
his shawl; he owned it; and the
fragment found in Mme. Chevreuse's
hand just fitted the torn corner,
thread for thread. I could see that
he was confounded when that came
up. He says he left the shawl in
Mrs. Ferrier's garden in the evening,
and went for it early in the morning
before anybody was up, and that he
found it just where he had left it.
He owned, too, that he put it slyly
into Mrs. Macon's carriage. He
said he knew her and what she was
collecting for; had heard all about
it at Madison. When he left his
broken harness&mdash;which, by the way,
was not broken, it appears, but only
unclasped somewhere&mdash;and went to
Mr. Grey's, he took his shawl over
his arm absent-mindedly, and found
it a nuisance while he was going
through the woods. Seeing Mrs.
Macon's carriage there full of parcels,
some gray blankets among
them, it occurred to him to add his
shawl to the pile without putting
any one to the trouble of thanking
him. He said that he believed those
nuns to be very good women, and
that he felt a respect for them for
the sake of F. Chevreuse, who had
been very polite to him. Fancy a
Jew taking off his shawl to give it
to a nun, and that to please a priest!
The story is too ridiculous, you
see. Oh! it is clear. There never
was a clearer case of circumstantial
evidence. No one could have
a doubt. But the verdict is too
hard."</p>

<p>"You think it should not have
been murder in the first degree?"
another voice asked.</p>

<p>"It should not," was the emphatic
reply. "It is almost an outrage
to make it so. But people became
ferocious the moment it was clear
that he was guilty, and I believe
they would gladly have taken him
out and hanged him to the first tree.
The fact undoubtedly is that he was
pressed for money, and meant to help
himself to the priest's. Mme. Chevreuse
heard him, and started to
alarm the house, and I think he
gave her an unlucky push. But
nothing of that sort would content
the prosecution nor the people.
They must have it that at the very
best he killed her wilfully when
he found that she had recognized
him. The female servant testified
that there was a candle overturned
in the priest's room, which must
have gone out in falling. Madame's
first thought would naturally be to
light a candle. Still, that is not
sure. That same servant wished to
show that the prisoner had a spite
against the priest's mother, and the
Carthusen girl had the same story;
but if people had been calm, their
gossip would have made no impression.
Schöninger's lawyer tried to
prove that madame's death resulted
from the fall; but there was a bad
bruise...."</p>

<p>F. Chevreuse gasped for breath.
"For God's sake, stop!" he cried
out, half turning toward the speaker,
then sinking instantly into his
seat again.</p>

<p>A perfect silence followed. The
priest was struggling with his feelings,
and regretting not having
withdrawn before his self-control
gave way, and the gentlemen behind
him were recovering the shock
of learning who their neighbor was,
and feeling their way to a solution
of the difficulty. One of them had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_792" id="Page_792">[Pg 792]</a></span>
an inspiration. "Let's go and
have a cigar," he said; and F.
Chevreuse was left to himself.</p>

<p>But his solitude was full of terrible
images, and in that few minutes
all his relations with the Jew had
been changed. He would not have
said to himself that he believed the
man guilty, and he would have said
that, guilty or innocent, he wished
him no harm; but what his imagination
had utterly refused to do in
connecting Mr. Schöninger with his
mother's tragical fate the plain talk
of this stranger had accomplished.
He could no longer separate the
two; and the sight of the Jew, or
the sound of his name even, would,
in future, call up associations intolerable
to him.</p>

<p>"You know all, then?" was F.
O'Donovan's greeting when they
met.</p>

<p>The face of F. Chevreuse showed,
indeed, that he had no questions,
or few, to ask.</p>

<p>"The law has decided," he said,
"and, for the present at least, I
cannot question its decision. They
know better than I how to arrive
at the truth. At the same time, I
never will say of a man that he is
guilty till he has himself told me
that he is, or till I have the evidence
of my own senses. And now,
what have you to tell me about my
people? Is it well with them?"</p>

<p>"It is well," was the echo.</p>

<p>The people had, indeed, settled
into their usual quiet mode of life
again with surprising readiness, as
often happens to those who, giving
themselves entirely up to an excitement,
exhaust its force the sooner.
The conviction and sentence of Mr.
Schöninger had not only given them
a satisfying sense of justice vindicated,
but had impressed them with
awe. The suddenness of his fall,
when they had leisure to contemplate
its accomplishment, was
startling. But a few weeks before,
he had walked their streets with a
step as proud as the proudest, and
there was not one among them,
whatever his prejudices, who was
not pleased to receive his salutation;
in a few months longer&mdash;months
of misery and disgrace&mdash;he
would be called on to suffer the
extreme penalty of the law.</p>

<p>Some of them remembered, too,
when all was over, the defence the
prisoner had made, if defence it
could be called, when he was permitted
to speak for himself. They
were bitter words, full of fierce and
haughty defiance and denunciation
and at the time their sole effect had
been to provoke still further against
him the popular rage; but, for
some reason, there was a thrilling
pathos in the recollection of them,
perhaps because they had been uttered
in vain, and because they
showed with what horror he contemplated
his impending doom.</p>

<p>"You seek my destruction because
I am a Jew, not because I
am a criminal," he exclaimed;
"and you condemn me without
proof. But do not flatter yourselves
that I shall perish so. Do
not believe that I shall fall a victim
to your insane and presumptuous
bigotry. It may triumph for a
time, but the triumph will be
short."</p>

<p>Not a very pleasant sort of address
to be listened to by a judge
who had tried to be impartial, and
meant to be honest, nor to a jury
who were fully convinced of the
speaker's guilt, and who had moreover,
as juries are likely to have, a
more than judicial sense of their
own dignity. Yet, for all that,
there was not one of them who
would have liked to face again those
flashing eyes and that white hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_793" id="Page_793">[Pg 793]</a></span>
pointing like a flame where his
words should fall. They were rather
afraid of the man, and looked
with equal uneasiness toward the
execution of his sentence and the
possibility of rescue or escape, or
of revenge even, which he had
seemed to threaten.</p>

<p>For the present, however, the
prison was strong and well guarded,
and the convict, being in solitary
confinement, had no means of communicating
with any friends he
might have outside. He was still
in Crichton, the state prison being
near the city jail; and still, if he
chose, he could look out from his
grated window and see the Christ
in air stretching out arms of loving
invitation to him.</p>

<h3>THE RELIGIOUS POLICY OF THE SECOND EMPIRE.</h3>


<p>[The following is the translation of a
remarkable memoir presented to Napoleon&nbsp;III.
by one of his Ministers of Public
Worship. Its authenticity is guaranteed
under oath by Leon Pagès, and the
date of its presentation seems to be about
the year 1860. It furnishes the key to
the religious events of the second period
of the reign of Napoleon III., and shows
how a government calling itself Catholic
plotted against, and was gradually destroying
the liberty of, the church. The
perfidy and falsehoods contained in the
document speak for themselves. The
programme detailed in the second part
of the same was only too faithfully carried
out, not only to the ruin of the emperor,
but to that of France also. It began
to be put in practice in the year
1860, and was persevered in until the
day when all power was taken from the
hands of its authors and abettors. The
key-note to the whole insidious production
is contained in the opening sentence&mdash;viz.,
that no matter what is done by
the Catholic Church, it must be for the
sake of obtaining influence over souls,
not for their spiritual and eternal welfare,
but for mere temporal and selfish
ends&mdash;for worldly power. To the Catholic
reader this one remark will be sufficient
to place him on his guard. We
copy from the <cite>Revue du Monde Catholique</cite>.&mdash;<em>Translator.</em>]</p>


<h4>I.</h4>

<p>The essential tendency of Roman
Catholicism has been, is,
and always will be, the spirit of
secular domination, the inevitable
result of transforming a man, the
Pope, into the infallible and absolute
vicar of Jesus Christ on earth.</p>

<p>If, before the Revolution of '89,
the clergy were Gallican&mdash;that is to
say, national&mdash;it was because it had
sufficiently attained that end of
temporal rule. It was the first
order of the state; it possessed
great wealth; it had its own organization,
and enjoyed considerable
privileges; its religion was the exclusively
dominant one. What else
could it ask, unless it wished to
displace royalty itself? The clergy
then was much more French and
royalist than Roman, solely because
it had such enormous interests at
stake in the soil and in the constitution
of the kingdom.</p>

<p>Again, if we study carefully the
so-called maxims and liberties of
the Gallican Church, we quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_794" id="Page_794">[Pg 794]</a></span>
recognize that between the kings
and the clergy these liberties constituted
a sort of commutative contract
entered into almost wholly at
the expense of the Papacy. The
bishops, generously treated by royalty,
in return consented to sacrifice
to royalty many of the Roman
pretensions, which, however, were
consequences of the spiritual supremacy;
and, with more reason,
they allowed the sovereign to settle
all matters of purely political independence.
In the Gallican Church,
the king rejected Papal infallibility,
because it necessarily implied his
temporal supremacy; and the bishops
to whom the doctrine would
perhaps in any other country have
been acceptable, rejected it likewise
because it would have disturbed
their privileges and their possessions,
which they owed to royalty.
It ought to be added that all
this was according to the ancient
traditions of the land, which had rendered
better service to the church
than any other, and which never desired
any foreign interference in its
own affairs. But certainly both the
French clergy and bishops would
have gone back to the pope and to
ultramontane ideas, unless their independence,
peaceful and magnificent,
had been assured them.</p>

<p>After the Revolution of '89, the
clergy, deprived of its possessions,
its privileges, its constitution, reduced
to the condition of salaried
functionaries, feeling its utter dependence
on the state, felt the necessity
of creating for itself a new
influence by detaching itself from
administrations over-neutral in its
regard. For a short time it saluted
Napoleon I. as the <em>restorer of
the altar</em>; then it submitted to his
powerful hand; but it hastened to
desert him when conquered, calling
him <em>the persecutor of Pius VII.</em>
It came to the support of the Restoration,
because of the recollections
of the past, and, above all, because
it hoped therefrom the re-establishment
of many immunities which
the Restoration did not dare,
in opposition to public opinion, to
concede to it. This is the reason
that, under the Restoration, it came
to pass that the clergy was more
occupied in caring for itself than
for royalty, so much so that it is
from this epoch that the first efforts
of return to ultramontanism date
their origin. No excuse can be
offered for Louis XVIII. and for
Charles X. for having allowed the
Concordat of 1801 and the organic
articles to remain in force, and for
not having given to the church an indemnity,
as they did to the exiles.</p>

<p>Under Louis Philippe, the clergy
was not deluded; it understood
very well that a parliamentary and
democratic government would never
permit it to work for the re-establishment
of its power. Consequently,
and under the pretext that
the church, accepting all <i lang="la">de facto</i>
governments, ought not to mix in
the risks and responsibilities of
politics, the clergy proclaimed its
absolute neutrality, which was but
another name for a complete separation.
Hence nothing is easier
of comprehension that it quickly
gave up all Gallican ideas, to rally
to the support of ultramontane doctrines.
Isolated, without influence,
without wealth, cramped in its
sphere of activity, it had no interest
in upholding the independence
of the state against the Holy See,
whilst everything invited it to defend
once more the famous thesis
of the Catholic Church, directing
kings and peoples, and giving to
the clergy the influence of a class
superior to all others. The anti-Gallican
demonstration, aided by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_795" id="Page_795">[Pg 795]</a></span>
the politicians of legitimacy and
of the Catholic party, who had
adopted as their watchword <em>free
education</em>, began to develop itself
rapidly in the episcopate, amongst
the inferior clergy in the seminaries
and religious orders, and even in
the halls of the two chambers.
Everything was prepared for the
solemn return to Rome, when the
Revolution of 1848 burst forth.</p>

<p>The religious party as well as the
legitimists, its auxiliary, at first accepted
that revolution because it
destroyed the upstart, usurping, and
Voltairian party. It afterwards
strove with energy to form a coalition
of all the elements of public
order, so as to escape from the
power of the demagogues; it was
this same motive which influenced
its votes in favor of the president;
it thus struck a blow at the democratic
and social republic. But
when it believed that Napoleon III.,
who had become successively dictator
and emperor, would consent
to play the part of another Charlemagne,
<i lang="la">Episcopus ad extra</i>, it became
devoted to him and enthusiastic.
But the emperor had no such
thought; he only wished to attach
the clergy firmly to the Empire by
honorable laws ensuring its safety
and liberty. By so doing he supplied
one of the greatest social
needs, without, however, departing
from a wise public policy; but he
had no intention of handing the
state over to the church. The clergy,
on its part, easily imagined what
he desired. Hence we see in 1852
(and this must not be passed over)
more earnestness and greater sympathy
in that portion of the episcopate
which was notoriously ultramontane.
It was that portion
which had been the best initiated
by Rome into its projects of encroachment,
which carried them out
with the greatest zeal, and which
consequently sought to conciliate
the good-will of the sovereign and to
engage him to pursue a course of
liberal toleration.</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that it immediately
insinuated how exceedingly
becoming it would be to enter
into what was called a compact
between the church and state&mdash;viz.,
the negotiation of a treaty which was
to replace the organic articles.</p>

<p>Now, as has been said at the beginning
of this memoir, Roman Catholicism
aiming necessarily at temporal
rule, the moment seemed so
much the more favorable to advance
in that undertaking, as the government
seemed to give its consent so
easily thereunto. The law of free education
already existed. The emperor
appeared unwilling to make use of
the prohibitions of the organic law
regulating public worship and of the
law concerning religious congregations
of men; consequently, provincial
councils were quickly organized
and congregations were multiplied.</p>

<p>The design of gaining possession
almost entirely of primary education
was avowed by bringing the influence
of the <i lang="fr">curés</i> to bear on the
various municipal offices, and, by
forcing the Christian Brothers to
refuse to receive from their rich
pupils any compensation whatever
for attending their schools, which
had been built and were supported
by the municipality: in this way
the Brothers received from the state
a compensation of 3,000,000, at the
expense of the lay schools.</p>

<p>The famous decree of 1852 was
then proposed to the emperor, but
without explaining its import.
This destroyed the ancient and
wise legislation of the council of
state, and allowed the almost unlimited
extension of authorizations to
establish congregations of women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_796" id="Page_796">[Pg 796]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of the lively opposition
of the majority of the bishops and
of the secular clergy, the Roman
liturgy was then inaugurated and
presented to the emperor as a simple
matter of material unity in
Catholic worship; care was taken
not to avow that this was a deadly
blow against the customs and constitution
of the Gallican Church,
the triumph of Romanism in France,
and a tax of more than six millions
on the manufactures and municipalities
of the Empire. All this was
necessary in order to obtain a brief
from the Pope in 1858 obliging the
clergy to recite in its liturgy the prayer
<i lang="la">Domine salvum</i>, which had been
excluded from the Roman Breviary.</p>

<p>Whilst, on the one hand, the clergy
sought to gain possession of the
people through the medium of primary
education, which was solicited
for the religious congregations by
all the charitable confraternities
(of S. Vincent of Paul, of S. Francis
Regis, of S. Francis Xavier, etc.,
etc.), through a multitude of foundations
of religious charity, on the
other it strove also to enlist in its
favor the children of the higher and
middle classes of society through
the numerous and immense educational
institutions of a superior character,
founded either by the bishops
or by the religious orders of Jesuits,
Carmelites, Marists, Dominicans,
etc. Thus the law of 1850, hostile to
all state education, brought forth
its fruits.</p>

<p>As to the education of girls, it
was and it is almost exclusively in
the hands of religious, from the
country infant schools and protectories
up to the most splendid educational
establishments of Paris;
on this point it is impossible for the
lay element to contend with the religious
element, which, either really
or apparently, will always present
far better guarantees to families for
morality and self-devotion. But the
point worthy of consideration here
is that this convent education, directed
by the inspiration and opinions
of the clergy, is not at all in
sympathy either with the existing
government or with public opinion.</p>

<p>This is the reason why the
episcopate and Rome have always
resisted any inspection on the part
of the state into their institutions,
except a purely nominal one, alleging
that these religious congregations
could submit only to ecclesiastical
inspection. In the regulations
made in 1852 too much was
yielded on that point.</p>

<p>It can be affirmed with truth to-day
that there is no class of society
which is not to a greater or less degree
entangled in the meshes so
admirably laid by the congregations
and associations called <em>benevolent</em>
or <em>charitable</em>. They gain
entrance even into the army, under
the pretext of giving gratuitous
instruction and spiritual conferences;
they gather together working-men
of every condition; they
establish a kind of freemasonry,
and of equality amongst citizens of
every rank; through their trusty
friends and adherents they are represented
in all the branches of the
government; they have possession
of the child and of the man in his
prime of life, of the poor and of the
rich; they are everywhere. This
enormous fact becomes a most
convincing proof, if we consider the
exact meaning of the name of these
congregations, associations, and
works of every kind, and of the end
each of them proposes to obtain.
It is almost certain that, directly or
indirectly, the Catholic idea permeates
them all; and as the direction
of that Catholic idea belongs more
than ever to Rome, the conclusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_797" id="Page_797">[Pg 797]</a></span>
is natural that all these means of
action so skilfully organized form
a kind of secret government, the
helm of which is in the hand of the
Roman cardinals, prefects of the
congregations.</p>

<p>The present religious agitation
proves the truth of this assertion.
The society of S. Vincent of Paul
has thought and acted exactly in
the same way as the convents, seminaries,
and religious orders; from
one end of the scale to the other
there is but one opinion, and the
pamphlet of M. de Segur can be
found in the <i lang="fr">salon</i> of the nuncio as
well as in the workshop&mdash;yes, even
on the bench of the lowest primary
school.</p>

<p>But it was not enough to have
thus securely encircled lay society
with so many arms employed for
the benefit of the religious element.
It was necessary to be certain that
these arms would always be used
conformably to the end in view&mdash;viz.,
the Roman Catholic supremacy.
The bishops and secular
clergy might perhaps grow restless
under this ultramontane domination;
they might perhaps, although
desiring the development of religion
and of their own personal
condition, either moderate a too
quick movement towards, or, for the
sake of their own independence,
even oppose themselves to the
absorption meditated at Rome.
Therefore, the effort was made, especially
since the beginning of
1852, to crush out even a show of
resistance from the bishops and
secular clergy; and the <em>Univers</em>,
the avowed organ of the Holy See,
whilst praising the emperor and attacking
violently the parliamentary
or liberal Catholic party (de Falloux,
de Montalembert, Lacordaire,
etc.), undertook to establish
a system of ecclesiastical compression,
which in the end triumphed.
M. Veuillot became the <em>lay pope
of the French</em>; with as much audacity
as talent, he set forth the
doctrines of the spiritual and temporal
supremacy of the Holy See;
he thundered against the schism of
the Gallican Church, and against
any compact which bound the
priest to the state.</p>

<p>And at the same time the Papal
nuncios in France surrounded the
bishops with an almost intolerable
servitude. Near each of them they
had devoted ecclesiastics, who spied
into and denounced their actions.
Any bishop suspected of favoring
independence or resistance was
the object of those thousands of
cunning tricks which Rome has
under its command because of the
powers it can either grant or refuse
to the episcopate.</p>

<p>Any priest of some eminence
who did not go over to the ultramontane
party was made the object
of threats and calumnies,
which, it was said, <em>would break his
episcopal cross</em>. Things came to
such a point that a Minister of Public
Worship, frightened at the bold
and dogmatic tone in which a
nuncio pronounced his <em>veto</em> on the
episcopal nominees, was forced to
make an energetic declaration concerning
the rights of the emperor,
and to tell that nuncio to bear it
in mind.</p>

<p>At the same time, also, Rome
endeavored to render the episcopate
subservient to itself by interfering
in the administration of
dioceses by granting the inferior
clergy the right of addressing the
prefects of the apostolic congregations
on all matters which concerned
conscience, liturgy, or dispensations.
So that the bishops,
humiliated, and with their jurisdiction
lessened, had no other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_798" id="Page_798">[Pg 798]</a></span>
resource left them to recover their
authority than to show themselves
ultramontanes, and so gain the
good graces of the Holy See.</p>

<p>Provincial councils, wherein zealous
men domineered, only served
to consummate that ruin of our ancient
church and of all opinions
which still bound the French clergy
to their native land.</p>

<p>More yet was wanted. The better
to secure the dependence of the
episcopate, the gradual substitution
of the regular for the secular clergy
was dreamt of. This was the reason
why monasteries of religious congregations
were multiplied, under
the pretext that there was need of
auxiliary priests to help the <i lang="fr">curés</i>
and their assistants. They built
churches, took possession of the
pulpits and confessionals, directed
the different confraternities; they
thus set aside and banished the
parochial clergy. In a few years,
things going on in this manner,
what would hinder the Pope from
saying to the bishops: "You have
no further need of seminaries to
recruit your clergy; look at the
numerous religious houses, from
which you can take your <i lang="fr">curés</i> and
assistants." And then what would
happen? The clergy of France
would no longer possess any national
character whatsoever. It
would be exclusively a Roman
army, under the command of the
generals of each congregation.
Episcopal authority would be completely
annihilated, and the church
in France would be under the absolute
command of the Pope. In
that case, only the most violent
struggles&mdash;a veritable civil war&mdash;could
alone save the concordat and
the independence of the state!</p>

<p>Nay, even now the Pope, abusing
the liberty granted, affects to look
on France as a province of his Catholic
empire. He freely promulgates
the acts and laws of his personal
administration, and rules here,
just as directly as he would at Ancona
or Perugia, the affairs of the
episcopate and of the church according
to the famous ultramontane
formula: "The clergy of France is
first Catholic, then French."</p>

<p>Nothing better proves the exactness
of these views than the study
of the causes and the progress of the
existing religious agitation about the
Italian question. The greater part
of the episcopate cared but little
for internal demonstrations; the
Pope brought the energetic appeal
of two encyclical letters to bear
upon them. Each bishop was harassed,
forced, menaced in the
name of his Catholic conscience, in
the name of his obligation of obedience
to the Pontiff. Three months
were required to wring from each
and all the wished-for pastoral letter.
And what do the leaders of
the ultramontane party say to-day?
"The French Church has spoken,"
cries the Bishop of Poitiers; "she
is unanimous."</p>

<p>Yes, by dint of the most violent
siege. It began by bending the
episcopate under the imposed doctrine
of the infallible superiority of
the Pope. That subjection was accomplished
by all the stratagems of
the administrative power of Rome
over spiritual matters and diocesan
affairs; and when, in consequence,
it was certain that there would be
no resistance on any question whatsoever,
even were it the political
question of the Romagna, they boast
that the free opinion of the Catholic
world has been given; they place
the Pope under the protection of
the universal church, which is
judged to have spoken and acted
freely. This is a strange use of
power and of trickery!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_799" id="Page_799">[Pg 799]</a></span></p>

<p>To recapitulate. Rome, as it
never goes out of the path leading
to its end, has wished and wishes to
create its own supremacy in France,
which has been so long prevented
by royalty allied to the French
clergy.</p>

<p>It has found a clergy not attached
to the soil and to the state by great
interests of wealth and influence.</p>

<p>Profiting by the situation, it has
wished to reduce the clergy into
bondage after a precise fashion by
the intrusion of all of the doctrines
of the ultramontane church, and, to
obtain its end, has employed all the
powers of polemics, of spiritual administration,
and of the regular
clergy.</p>

<p>The clergy conquered, it has
marched on to possess itself of all
classes of society through the medium
of educational institutions, of
confraternities and congregations of
every kind, and has established an
organization as vast as it is formidable.</p>

<p>Henceforth Rome rules the clergy
and the Church of France, and,
through the clergy and the church,
it means to rule the country.</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p>Such is a true picture of the religious
situation.</p>

<p>However, if the French clergy
seem unwilling to oppose any further
external resistance to the doctrines,
plots, and encroachments of
Rome, it must not be forgotten that
very many of its members in conscience
are far from approving what
they call the excesses of ultramontanism,
because they fear for their
own safety and for that of the true
religion.</p>

<p>A great part of the episcopate realizes
the fact that the effort is being
made to reduce them to the condition
of simple vicars apostolic,
whose jurisdiction could be recalled,
and to suppress the <i lang="la">proprium
jus episcopûm</i>. They foresee that
the nation will never go back on
the civil and political progress
made in order to place itself under
any theocracy whatsoever.</p>

<p>Consequently, they are not convinced
of the strength of the proposed
ultramontane arrangement,
which may be set forth in these
terms: "Be no longer a French
episcopate; acknowledge your absolute
dependence on the Pope;
and, in recompense, we will have <em>all</em>
together the religious government
of France." Such a plan would
expose religion to many and inevitable
conflicts, in which it would be
either swallowed up by worldly
views, or would be gravely compromised.</p>

<p>As a rule, we may also add that
the clergy has no idea of separating
itself from the emperor, who is the
highest guarantee of social order,
and whose religious loyalty it well
knows.</p>

<p>Finally, to sum up all, it clearly
sees that it must live and die in the
bosom of France, where it was
born; and that, if it does not enjoy
the advantages it did in times past,
it yet receives from the state whatever
constitutes its sphere of activity,
its security, and its existence.
For the national clergy to quarrel
angrily and irrevocably with the emperor
and with the nation is a thing
easier said than done, the more
so as it hates the religious orders,
and has no other support whatsoever
for its own independence except
the laws and good-will of the
government.</p>

<p>It sees only too well what would
become of it if the government,
judging it irrevocably hostile,
should all at once suppress all
sympathy towards it, should cut off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_800" id="Page_800">[Pg 800]</a></span>
from it all sources of liberality and
of toleration, and should brand it
before the country as alien to the
national feelings and blindly obedient
to ultramontane passions. Here
is the key-note to the disagreements
which now exist amongst the clergy.
The dispute and the declaration of
1682 are buried in the past. The
controversy is not a theological one
at all. It is exclusively one of our
own day, exclusively political, exclusively
social; and, if the ultra-montanists
of to-day are the same
as those of past times, the present
Gallicans are by no means like
those of the time of Louis XIV.
We must live either in our own age
or the life of the middle ages; we
must be either French or Roman.
Such is the true state of the question.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances, what
is to be done?</p>

<p>Must we, by abruptly changing our
whole system of government, expel
the religious congregations of men,
modify the law concerning education,
apply all the organic articles,
and reach such a point that the law,
fully carried out, will look very
much like persecution? No; for
then the sincerity of the sovereign
might be called into question on
account of his passing so quickly
from a generous and affectionate
protection to all the rigors of prohibition;
it would inflict a deep
wound on the entire clergy and on
a vast multitude of honorable Catholics;
it would give rise to the suspicion
that, in spite of all to the
contrary, a return was being made
to Voltairian prejudices; and perhaps
it would necessitate a defence
against an anti-religious reaction
which would consider all its excesses
justifiable.</p>

<p>The measures to be taken ought
not to surpass the limits of the
abuses to be suppressed, and to
be carried out in behalf of the respect
due to the supreme power,
for the welfare of public tranquillity
and of religion well understood.
Besides, it is well known that public
opinion acts as a kind of police
over the faults of the clergy. As
often as the clergy departs from its
true sphere of action and strives to
encroach upon the powers and independence
of society, it creates a
circle of resistance and opposition
which subdues it. To-day men
are frightened at what they think
are the outbursts of revolutionary
passion, but which in reality are
only the energetic manifestation of
public opinion rebelling against the
wishes of those in favor of theocracy.
Preserve the uprightness of
the religious sentiment of the nation;
use no violence; borrow
from our public law what is necessary
to put a stop to insupportable
encroachments; in this way separate
the course of religion as sincerely
practiced from the arrogance and
calculations of the Roman propaganda&mdash;such,
I think, is a course of
action well adapted to the necessities
of the hour, and will obtain the
approbation of the country.</p>

<p>Taking these general notions for
a basis, perhaps the following
measures would be most opportune:</p>

<p>1st. Except in cases of local necessity,
which is to be well proven,
to tolerate no other new establishment
of religious communities of
men, whether it be a question of
conventual houses, churches, chapels,
even under the pretext that
they are to act as auxiliaries
in the sacred ministry, or whether
it be a question of institutions for
public instruction and works of
public charity. The hospitality so
generously granted by the emperor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_801" id="Page_801">[Pg 801]</a></span>
to communities of men, although
prohibited by law, will, in this way,
remain inviolate. "You are numerous
enough, and France has not
been given to you to drain;" this
is a sensible answer, which cannot
incur the reproach of exclusion.
Besides, why will not those who
force themselves into the religious
communities enter and recruit the
ranks of the secular clergy, the parochial
clergy? Where is the necessity
of increasing the regular
clergy which belongs to the Roman
government? There are at present
in France 68 associations or
congregations of men, 19 only of
which are authorized as teaching
and charitable communities. They
have under their charge 3,088 institutions
or schools, they number 14,304
religious and have 359,953 pupils.</p>

<p>2d. Henceforth exercise the greatest
severity in granting permission
for the establishment of congregations
of women, only granting the
same when the actual undeniable
necessity of public charity or primary
education requires it; demand
certain proofs that they have
sufficient resources for their support;
do not easily grant permission
for the conversion of local
communities into communities subject
to a superioress-general, which
inundate France with their annexed
establishments. True it is that <i lang="la">de
facto</i> congregations cannot be stopped;
but, as they are not recognized
by law, they know that every one
of their members remains subject to
the common law; and the <i lang="la">de facto</i>
congregation, which collectively
has no civil existence, can therefore
neither receive gifts nor legacies,
neither can it act as a corporation.
At present there are in France
236 communities of woman subject
to superioresses-general, which
have, besides the 236 principal foundations,
2,066 secondary or annexed
establishments; and about 700 congregations
or communities under
local superioresses (each of these
last forms a distinct establishment,
governed by its own superioress,
and independent of the establishments
of the same religious order
established elsewhere); to which
we must add about 250 religious associations
of women not yet recognized,
but existing <i lang="la">de facto</i>.</p>

<p>3d. As to what concerns the
<em>authorized</em> communities of men or
women, let the council of state
exercise the greatest severity in
the matter of gifts, legacies, and
charitable donations it permits
them to receive. Here we must
consider not only the condition and
protests of families demanding a
reduction of such donations, but we
must also examine into the necessities
of the community so rewarded.
There is no reason why we
should procure for them the means
of a useless or abusive extension,
by authorizing them to receive
what is necessary to defray expenses
they ought never to have incurred.
Communities once established
will remain what they are, if the
fruitful source of liberality which
they provoke and seek for be
wanting to stimulate the natural
tendency of these communities to
extend themselves indefinitely.
The spirit of rivalry which exists
amongst them, the lust of propagation
and of power, all drive them
on towards an incessant development.
Once entered on this path,
they must have money, and they
put their wits to work to find out
and appeal for help, for donations,
and for alms. If the regulations
concerning such gifts and legacies
were more severe, if the principle
were established that such liberality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_802" id="Page_802">[Pg 802]</a></span>
which is only an encouragement to
the extension of expenses and of
establishments, would no longer be
tolerated, an abrupt stop would be
put to the excess of which we to-day
complain.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that these
congregations, authorized or non-authorized,
have always the means
of evading the law and of receiving
gifts secretly. This cannot be prevented
when the affair is conducted
cunningly, and the congregations
are not without skilful counsellors or
numerous adherents ready to aid
them in everything. But even in
this case, the amount of these evasions
or of manual gifts which deprive
families of the livelihood obtained
for them by their author
is easily appreciable. Whence, for
example, have the immense resources
of the religious orders, vowed
to poverty, proceeded, which they
must have consecrated to their numerous
and vast establishments?
The real estate of the Jesuits surpasses
twenty millions. How did
they buy or build them? Certainly
from private donations. Now, this
being a fact, does it not follow that
there is an obligation on the state
not to tolerate any new establishments,
which would necessitate new
appeals to private charity, and the
certainty that by such a prohibition
it would act wisely?</p>

<p>4th. Maintain, as far as possible,
without destroying the liberty of
choice in the municipal councils,
<em>lay</em> primary education. If, through
the intelligence and firmness of the
prefects, a stop be not put to the
incessant plottings of the clergy,
forcing the townships to entrust
their schools to the Christian Brothers,
there will be soon no lay
teachers, except in such poverty-stricken
localities as the brothers
disdain to take. Here we must
remark that an effort is being
made to multiply congregations of
so called <em>Little Brothers</em>, who install
themselves in isolated country
places, whilst the Christian Brothers
can only form an establishment in
which <em>three brothers</em> will be in the
same school. Townships not having
resources and population sufficient
to receive the Christian Brothers
will then be attended to by these
<em>Little Brothers</em>, called after Lamennais,
S. Viator, Tinchebray, etc.,
and so it will come to pass that lay
teachers will be entirely suppressed.
As these teachers to-day, modest
and useful public officers, are devoted
to the emperor, and render
notable service in the rural districts,
considering that universal suffrage
is the law of the land, we would be
very much weakened if all primary
instruction passed into the hands
of congregations which depend
more on Rome than on France.
Nay, more, it would be wise henceforth
not to recognize as places of
public utility any congregation of
men for primary education. There
are at present in France 49,639 <em>lay</em>
schools for boys and girls, attended
by 2,410,517 children; and 14,602
<em>conventual</em> schools, attended by
1,342,564. Moreover, we must remark
that in the academies of
young girls directed by congregations,
in the free primary schools
entrusted to them, as well as in the
secondary schools wherein their influence
reigns, we meet histories
compiled to glorify monarchies of
divine right, to exalt religious supremacy,
to lower indirectly the
civil and political principles acquired
since 1789. Truly these
establishments, so numerous, are, to
a greater or less degree, real branches
of the legitimist and Catholic
party. On the contrary, it is in our
imperial lyceums, in our municipal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_803" id="Page_803">[Pg 803]</a></span>
colleges, in our lay schools, that we
find a more robust and popular instruction
given, which fosters the
national sentiments in the hearts of
the children. Where is it that you
hear the cry cordially given, <i lang="fr">Vive
l'Empereur</i>? Certainly not in the
congregational establishments.</p>

<p>5th. Uphold with energy state education,
because it is the true national
education; place its institutions,
by a sufficient budget, in a condition
to enlarge their capacity, to
perfect their staff and their means
of instruction&mdash;this is the key to
the events of the future. The Catholic
legitimist party understood
this only too well in demanding under
Louis Philippe, with so much
ardor, liberty of education, monopolized
by the university, and in 1850,
under the presidency, in having the
law on public instruction passed.
Later, under the dictatorship, it had
the hardihood to dream of the total
abolition of state education, in order
to hand it over to the clergy
and to the congregations; but the
emperor, fully instructed on the intent
of such a measure, refused his
consent. But it remains a fact,
however, that, thanks to the law of
1850, granting to every French citizen
liberty to teach, the Catholic
legitimist party has been enabled
to perpetuate in the young generations
that division of castes and of
ideas which would have disappeared
under the system of a united
university education. It has been
enabled, through the pupils brought
up in congregational houses, to give
continued existence to its own social
and political doctrines. This
is a great evil, no doubt; but, great
as it is, it is impossible to think of
suppressing the law which guarantees
the liberty of the family. That
would necessitate an immense struggle,
a bloody one, and one contrary
to justice. There remains, then,
but this one escape, as equitable as
it is prudent; everything concurs
in it: let us strengthen and favor
state education, which fits one for
any career in life, which is the most
solid and most patriotic, whilst, at
the same time, let it be made religious,
moral, and paternal.</p>

<p>6th. As far as it can be done without
forcing things too far, let us put
in execution the organic regulations,
which place salutary checks on the
encroachments of the Papal power
over the clergy and the state; in
other words, let us tolerate no new
attack against our civil legislation
and our political constitution, whether
in writings or in the pulpit.</p>

<p>Place the office of the nuncio in
France under the same regulations
as any other embassador of a friendly
power, and do not allow him to
correspond at all, in the Pope's
name, with the French bishops, nor
allow him to perform any act of
jurisdiction, nor allow him to have
the least say in the choice of bishops.</p>

<p>With a firm hand prevent any
act of the court of Rome from
either being received, published,
or distributed in France without
the authorization of the government.</p>

<p>Choose resolutely the bishops
from pious and honorable ecclesiastics,
but such as are known for their
sincere attachment to the emperor,
and to the institutions of France.</p>

<p>Suppress all religious journals,
the need of which no one dreamt
of before the invasion and agitations
of the ultramontane party.
The clergy has its discipline, its
bishops, its priests, its pulpits, its
mandates, its pastoral letters, and a
complete government. There is
no necessity at all of adding the
polemics of the press to the ordinary
means of publicity for this
ecclesiastical government. Besides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_804" id="Page_804">[Pg 804]</a></span>
the whole of that press has always
been the instrument for spreading
the doctrines and designs of the
Roman theocracy, or parliamentary
Catholicism. To-day it supplies
the most energetic nutriment towards
a religious agitation. Suppress
this focus of excitement,
which is spreading into every presbytery,
and the clergy will remain
quiet. The <em>Univers</em> has upset the
heads of all the younger clergy by
preaching religious supremacy, and
the harm done by it will not be
effaced for many a long year.
To impose the protection of the
church on the state; to sap all civil
and political liberties; to undermine
all lay institutions; to attack
incessantly every European alliance,
except that with Austria and
the Catholic states, thus to introduce,
above everything else, and
everywhere, the influence, the ideas,
and the power of Rome&mdash;such is
the work of religious journals supported
by the legitimist party.</p>

<p>Encourage, finally, the public
study of the ancient French liberties,
and profess everywhere and
with spirit the conservative principles
of the independence of the
state alongside of that of the Papacy.</p>

<p>7th. Moreover, persevere in a
course of loyal protection for the true
interests of religion and of deference
towards the clergy. Nothing would
be wiser, and, at the same time,
nothing more just, than to increase
the honor paid to the inferior
clergy, who in almost the whole of
France experience the direst privations.
In this way they would be
attached to the government. If
the episcopate, through weakness
or any other motive, abandoned the
emperor, he would be compelled to
conciliate the inferior clergy, who
ask nothing better than to have a
little more ecclesiastical independence,
and who sometimes suffer
from episcopal despotism. At all
events, it is of great importance
that the religious part of the nation
be amazed at the noise occasioned
by these Roman quarrels, or remain
indifferent concerning them,
seeing the national worship always
tranquil, protected, and honored.
For this reason it is very useful
that the grants of the budget be increased
towards the construction
and repairing of churches, presbyteries,
and diocesan buildings.</p>

<p>8th. Finally, perhaps it would be
opportune for the government to
turn its attention to those large lay
associations, such as those of S. Vincent
of Paul, of S. Francis Xavier,
etc., which, by their administration
and the nature of their works, are
really in the hands of the clergy
and of the legitimist party. The
conferences of S. Vincent of Paul
to-day are more than nine hundred
in number; they penetrate every
rank of society, and even into the
lyceums and colleges, where they
affiliate even the children under the
title of <em>aspirants</em>. They are connected
to a principal conference in each
department of the country; they
are governed by a general council
of that society, which has presented
to the Holy Father at Rome a report
on the general condition of
the French conferences. It is a
formidable association, which, as it
has at its disposal so many members
and such resources, forms, as it were,
a secret and complete government.
Our laws do not at all admit the
independent organization of such
associations. Recognizing the
charitable and Christian end of the
Society of S. Vincent of Paul, the
benefits which undoubtedly are to be
attributed to it, the excellent spirit
of many of its members, it is im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_805" id="Page_805">[Pg 805]</a></span>possible
not to perceive the intentions
of the men who have the privilege
and inspiration of its government;
it is impossible, also, not to
grow uneasy at the existence of so
vast and so skilful an organization,
through which thousands of citizens
can receive such or such an impulse,
or such or such a word of command.
Disinterested benevolence can easily
pass to such a society of propagandists;
and charitable societies,
in order to exist and to do good,
have no need of going beyond their
own district, nor of affecting a spirit
of affiliation and of a cemented union,
which up to the present time
has only existed in secret revolutionary
societies. Is it not to be
feared that they will in some sort
replace the ancient Catholic associations
of the Restoration, which
were then named "Jesuits in short-tailed
coats, or the Congregation"?</p>

<p>There can be no doubt at all that
there is no one who now enters
these societies solely for love of
charity or to satisfy his taste for religious
exercises; they are so numerous,
so well filled up from all
ranks of society, that a powerful,
compact interest is thereby established
which offers inducements for
the welfare of families and for any
career in life. The Society of S.
Vincent of Paul, which, as we have
seen, initiates the children in our
lyceums and colleges, has entered
into the polytechnic school and into
every branch of the civil administration.
It is developing in the
army, in the magistracy, at the
bar; everywhere, in fine, it manifests
its secret influence, and unites
all its members by the bonds of
mutual support. To be a member
of the Society of S. Vincent of Paul
to-day is not merely to make an
act of religious adhesion; it is to
enter into a secret world, strongly
organized, acting on all sides upon
the opinions and the affairs of society;
it is to gain active and influential
protectors, and to secure for
one's self all the avenues leading
to success in the different chances
or walks of life. The democrats
would have desired to establish a
republican unity of interests. The
clerics and ultramontanes, allied to
the legitimists, <em>have</em> established the
mutual support of the S. Vincent
of Paul Society. What an immense
lever this could become in
hostile hands to move political
ideas! Yes, we must repeat, the
power of these associations is such
that men enter them for purely
temporal motives. They influence
the determinations of families more
than one dreams of; and it is a very
strange spectacle to see a considerable
number of our civil officers
enrolled under their banners, whilst
their children, avoiding the state institutions,
receive their instruction
from the Jesuits, the Carmelites,
the Marists, the Dominicans.</p>

<p>This memoir has been composed
in a spirit of pure frankness and
truth. We have wished to dissemble
nothing. Yet if the matters
treated of in this memoir be serious,
we know full well that they do
not constitute a fatal danger for the
country. We can face them coolly.
The material and moral power of
the government of the emperor is
immense. The majority in France
cares very little for clerical pretensions,
and will never bow before
the theocratical doctrines of Rome
nor before the intrigues and lamentations
of the coalesced political
parties. The country has too
much trust in the national interests,
and too great faith in the principles
of modern society, not to crush, by
the very manifestation of its opinions,
all this laborious restoration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_806" id="Page_806">[Pg 806]</a></span>
men and of the theories of the
past. But as these are elements of
agitation and disorder, it is the
duty of a provident government to
watch attentively. "Prudence begets
safety."</p>

<h3>GRACE SEYMOUR'S MISSION.</h3>


<p class="center">CONCLUDED.
</p>

<p>September was painting the
leaves in the wooded valleys of
Gloucestershire, and the fields were
just bared of their golden crowns.
A noble mansion, where generations
of Howards had reigned, was waiting
for its little lord to come from beyond
the seas. In old days, the Howards
had been among the truest and
bravest of the champions of the old
faith; even now their head branches
had not thrown off their allegiance
to the church, but the glory
of the martyr had paled before the
renown of the statesman and the
fame of the soldier, in the eyes of
at least this offshoot of the great
Catholic house. Since the reign
of James I., these Gloucestershire
squires had been the main stay of
the Low-Church party, and the family
tradition had remained the
same to the days of Elizabeth Howard,
little George's mother.</p>

<p>One bright day a rather awkward
travelling-carriage drove up to the
oaken door of Howard Hall, and
George Charteris, with his little
cousin, dashed up the steps. Grace
and her father followed; they were
but visitors, with no authority and
no influence. Only one day did
they remain there, the young lawyer
escorting them back to London;
the child was left to the care of the
elder Charteris and his family.</p>

<p>The young man had not let time
pass without making good use of it,
and he had already been once refused
by the beautiful girl, whose
influence over him seemed so
strange and unaccountable to himself.
Her father had said he was
well satisfied at his child's conduct,
as she was not one to speak hastily
and then repent her words; but
George Charteris did not give up
all hope.</p>

<p>Grace and Mr. Seymour lived
very quietly, even poorly; the guardian
of their little George allowed
them a scanty sum out of the estate,
on his own responsibility, and on
the condition that it should be subject
to the child's good pleasure
when he should have attained his
majority. Mr. Seymour had serious
thoughts of going abroad to study
for the priesthood, and Grace's
peculiar religious state had suffered
no alteration since her departure
from America.</p>

<p>Among the new convert's self-imposed
tasks of charity was a weekly
visit to one poor family, whose
drunken son was their shame and
endless burden. Dependent upon
him for a precarious living, his old
parents, both crippled by an accident
on a farm where years ago they
had been employed, lodged in a
miserable den, which, through a
large-heartedness that is oftener
seen among the poor than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_807" id="Page_807">[Pg 807]</a></span>
rich, they had shared with two
sickly orphan children, the only
ones left of a family of seven, carried
off with father and mother
by the small-pox. Whatever the
drunken man brought home was
shared with these desolate little
ones; whatever was given in charity
was brought to feed them and keep
in them the little life they had ever
had. Four more helpless beings
perhaps hardly existed, and all dependent
upon one whose conscience
was dead, and whose animal nature
hideously survived the paralyzation
of his soul's organism. Mr. Seymour
and his daughter came upon
them by the merest chance, and
ever after remained to them the
firmest friends, the most gentle benefactors,
they had ever dared to
dream of. But the zealous convert
was anxious to do a greater good
than the mere corporal works of
mercy implied by his visits to these
forlorn creatures. In moments
when his demon was not on him,
the unhappy son of these poor people
sometimes listened to Mr. Seymour's
earnest appeals to his buried
conscience. With good results for
a few hours the poor family had at
first to be satisfied; then, as they
hoped their infatuated son would
gradually reward the efforts of his
kind adviser, he would suddenly
grow more brutish than before, and
more irreclaimable. His companions
would jeer at the "gentleman
missioner," in those days when
gentlemen were the worst preachers
because the worst violators of temperance;
and the old people would
sometimes tremblingly speak to their
benefactor of danger and of trouble
to come, if he persisted too openly
in his religious and moral advice.</p>

<p>But the zeal that burnt within
Edward Seymour was no faint light
to be extinguished by the first tainted
breath of danger-fraught opposition;
bravely he spoke and advised
and remonstrated, waiting
only for a few preliminaries to be
arranged, in order to leave for a
quiet scene, where in prayer and
study he was to prepare himself for
tasks as dangerous and as thankless
as were his present occupations.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, his daughter, the domestic
angel of his silent, shrine-like
home, thought and read and
pondered deeply, her love for her
one companion in life bringing to
her heart a longing desire to be at
unity with him, to be a sister and a
sharer in his faith, and, above all, a
partaker in his sacrifice. For she
could not bear to see him suffer in
earthly comforts, and not feel that
she, too, bore a part of his burden;
she longed to believe as he did, if
only to suffer as he did; for as long
as she stood aloof from his inner
life, she felt, after all, but as one
who should watch sympathizingly
on the shore while another human
being was battling with the crested,
storm-tossed waves beyond. Once
or twice, with her father, Grace had
gone to a quiet service in a lowly
house, where a priest made a temporary
chapel whenever he could
spend a few days in town. His
coming was a joy to a faithful knot
of friends, and before his impromptu
altar many ranks and stations
in life were represented, from the
brilliant owner of lordly estates to
the poor Irish artisan and the
old women who reigned, then as
now, over the London apple-stalls.
Among the silent, earnest worshippers
of this "tabernacle in the desert"
was one whose thoughts had
been singularly attracted towards
Grace. He saw her sit by her father's
side, grave and attentive, a
sad, wistful look on her pale face,
never joining in the simple devo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_808" id="Page_808">[Pg 808]</a></span>tions
which evidently were so familiar
to her companion, but often
fixing her hopeless, passionate gaze
upon his faith-illumined features.
Sometimes Grace would suddenly
feel, like to the rush of a falling star
through the purple sky of night, a
glimmering perception of at least a
possibility of truth existing in this
persecuted religion. Perhaps the
very persecution roused her pity and
her sympathy, and held within itself
a fascination uneasily resisted by a
noble mind.</p>

<p>Had the faith of her father been
presented to her under its gorgeous
exterior of uncurtailed ritual and
acknowledged supremacy, her heart
might have turned away from the
glittering triumph; but now, were
the followers of this condemned
Catholic faith not exiles and wanderers,
threatened with prisons and
fines, hunted down by prejudice
and malignity, oppressed with the
worst oppression&mdash;social and political
ostracism? How could her
heart help going out towards them,
and crying blindly in the darkness
that it felt for them and pitied their
woes and admired their self-sacrifice?</p>

<p>The day we have alluded to was
one of those on which such awakenings
were stirring in her soul,
and the fight between the world
and God was beginning for the
holding of this stray prize, whose
purchase had been made, centuries
ago, upon the cross of Calvary.</p>

<p>The good priest, who knew of her
state through his conversations with
her father, took care to infuse a
little wholesome and clearly-defined
doctrine into the short discourse
he gave after Mass. It was
not without its effect, and Grace's
eager, thoughtful air did not escape
the notice of her silent observer,
who was not long in persuading
the pastor to make him acquainted
with Mr. Seymour and his daughter.</p>

<p>He was a young, tall, athletic
man, a thorough Saxon, with blue
eyes that were truth itself, and a
lion-like form that seemed the very
embodiment of unconquerable endurance
and indomitable bravery.
One thought instinctively, on looking
at him, of the word "standard-bearer,"
as if that, and that alone,
were a description meet for him,
moral and physical in one; the only
adequate word wherewith to blazon
forth his glorious perfection of
man and child combined. As reverent
towards God, as loyal towards
women, as though he were
of those who "always see the Father's
face," he was as uncompromising,
as frank, as firm towards
the world of daily shoals in whose
treacherous midst he lived as if
temptation were a mythic fear, and
the possibility of sin a sealed book
to his heart. The child of persecution,
the royal offspring of danger
that could not appall and repression
that could not crush, Edmund
Oakhurst was like the mountain-bred
hunter who, reared amid
the sterile crags of unscalable
Alps and sea-girt coasts, leaps from
rock to rock, regardless of chasm
and torrent, and angry tides rolling
over the stone where a moment
ago his venturesome but ever-sure
foot had lightly rested. The eagles
might scream round his head, the
sea roar at his feet, the sky darken
and the frail bark toss, he cared
little, for a brave heart and a bold
hand, with God for a guide&mdash;are
they not equal to resisting the
world's treacherous assaults? Such
is a slight sketch of the young man
who now stood before Grace, bashful
yet bold, and looked up into
her eyes with such wondering ques<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_809" id="Page_809">[Pg 809]</a></span>tions
mutely brightening his own.
Her father was pleased with the
stranger, and together they soon
fell into a conversation on the position
of the faith in America, and
of the contrast between its present
state and that of triumphant supremacy
it had enjoyed in that hemisphere
when Spain was the queen
of nations.</p>

<p>The young man went home with
Mr. Seymour, and it was evening
ere they parted. Grace was silently
entranced. The faith that
had such children as that, and
could draw to itself such an one as
her father, must it not have some
unsuspected vitality which could
be none other than <em>truth</em>? Often
and often their new friend came
again, and each time he came the
young girl felt a solemn enthusiasm
for all things great and noble
distil from his every word and
glance, and wrap her round in a
bewildered dream, the voice of
which seemed to sing for ever in
her ears, "Go and do thou likewise."
Lights broke in upon her
from unexpected places; books she
had laid down in hopeless reverence,
deploring that to her their
spiritual beauty was incomprehensible,
yet sure that their beauty of
language must be the veil of the
hidden shrine, she now took up
again, and, reading, began to understand.
Her father, whose labors
among the poor Edmund Oakhurst
now joined, was too silently
happy to notice, save by gentle, unobtrusive
aid, the renovating work
going on in his child's soul, and
seemed to brighten under this new
and blessed influence. Soon his
daughter spoke openly to him, and,
not many months after the quiet
meeting at the chapel, she was under
instruction. He delayed his
already formed plans, to be at her
side at this moment, and, together
as ever, the two prayed and read
and studied, till life seemed to
Grace too full and happy for earth.</p>

<p>George Charteris had ceased
visiting his relations much, especially
after having once or twice
met Edmund Oakhurst. The contact
with his accustomed circle of
by no means very intellectual or
very sensitive friends had soon
worn off the interest his better nature
had once taken in the thoughtful,
earnest life of the convert and
his daughter. He, however, very
good-naturedly continued to write
to them, giving accounts of little
George's health and general goings-on.</p>

<p>One night Edward Seymour and
his young friend sat alone by the
dying fire, while the cold drizzle
without veiled the window, and the
damp seemed to soak in through
every chink and cranny in the
poorly furnished room. Both men
wore their great-coats, but they
hardly seemed to notice the cold.</p>

<p>"It is nearly eighteen months
now since we came," said Mr. Seymour,
"and I am not off to France
yet. However, in less than a
month that last step will be taken,
and I shall be at peace."</p>

<p>"And the favor I have asked you
will be mine&mdash;so you assure me,"
hesitatingly answered Oakhurst.</p>

<p>"I only bid you try yourself, and
see if I am not right," said his
friend. "Nothing would make me
happier; and as to her, I have already
told you that she believes it
was through your influence that
God made the truth plain to her."</p>

<p>"But if she should think that I
take her at a disadvantage; or if
she should marry me because, being
unprotected, she would be grateful
for a home&mdash;or rather, a husband,
for the <em>home</em> is hers&mdash;or, worse than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_810" id="Page_810">[Pg 810]</a></span>
all, suppose she thought I was so
poor as to need the little she has to
give?"</p>

<p>"My dear boy, these are groundless
fears. She thinks of nothing
but of God and of his leadings in
these matters; she never <em>has</em> looked
at things from her childhood up
with the world's eyes, and I think
the mere idea of the possibility of a
man's marrying for money would
be to her absolutely monstrous and
ridiculous. Remember how quiet
and lonely her life at home always
was, and say if she <em>could</em> be so
worldly-wise?"</p>

<p>"It is true. After all, I wrong her;
it is unworthy of me to dream of
such things; only I feel so utterly
beneath her in mind and soul, so
simple in the deep things she hides
in her heart, so unlearned in the
marvellous paths through which she
has been led."</p>

<p>"My son," said Seymour gravely,
"do not wrong yourself. I never
dreamed that I was worthy of her
mother, but I knew that, all unworthy
as I was, God had chosen
me for her guardian; so it is now
with you, for she is her mother
over again. But whenever was a
treasure given to the worthy only?
Think you Mary was worthy of being
the mother of Jesus, or Joseph
of being the spouse of Mary? Are
any of us worthy of being sons of
God and heirs of heaven? Above
all, am I worthy to be a priest of
the Most High? But the question
lies not there; it lies in God's will,
God's decrees, God's call to us, his
children. Is the slave worthy to
bear the priceless crown, whose
gems flash in his dark hands, in
some eastern procession? But the
king has deputed him to bear it,
and his obedience stands for worthiness."</p>

<p>"Mr. Seymour," said the young
man earnestly, "you are right, and,
if it be my blessed lot to be your
child's guardian, God will give me
grace to find favor in her sight
first, and never betray her trust in
me for ever after. I will ask her."</p>

<p>He did ask her a few days later,
in simple, manly phrase, and she
answered him in silence. Her
heart was too full for speech, and
he loved her too well to dispute
her first, though unspoken, behest.
But after a few moments, she knelt
down, and hand-in-hand they prayed,
without telling each other why
and for what, and yet each seemed
to know.</p>

<p>In the evening of the same day
Mr. Seymour and his friend were
to go to the cottage of a poor family,
where sometimes a little, informal
meeting used to take place&mdash;a
forerunner of the crowded temperance
gatherings our more fortunate
age can boast.</p>

<p>Once more the father and daughter
stood close together, waiting
for Edmund Oakhurst. The pale
moon looked in at the narrow casement,
the street was slippery with
recent rain, and the wind was damp
and cold. Within burned one low
candle on the table before the fireplace,
where the coals were blackening
into ashes, and every now
and then throwing out a tongue of
dim, red flame, only to make the
black emptiness more noticeable.</p>

<p>"I will have the fire all right
when you come back, darling,"
said Grace, "and some hot wine
and water ready for you. Mind
you keep that cloak well about
you. O my love! I cannot bear to
think we have so few days before
us still!"</p>

<p>"Almost a few weeks, Grace,"
said her father cheerfully.</p>

<p>"It seems to me as if they were
days," reiterated the girl; "but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_811" id="Page_811">[Pg 811]</a></span>
I know it is right. My mother
would say so, if she could speak to
us from her home in the spirit-land.
Kiss me, my father, my own!"</p>

<p>There was almost a despairing
wail under that quick exclamation.
Seymour felt strangely moved, but,
unwilling to weaken his child's fortitude,
he kissed her and soothed
her in the most cheerful way he
could, yet tenderly keeping her
hands clasped in his. Edmund
Oakhurst was not long, and the two
men were soon ready to start.
Grace took the candle, and led the
way down the dark stairs. She
motioned her lover to go out first,
and then, detaining her father, said
in a voice broken by uncontrollable
emotion:</p>

<p>"My own precious father, bless
me before you go."</p>

<p>He caught her in his arms, and
laid one hand on her head, murmuring,
"God bless you for ever, my
child, as your father does now.
Don't give way, my love, my little
treasure, and think of me while I
am gone. We will have a nice
evening together when we come
home, my pet." And he gave her
a fervent, solemn kiss, and pressed
her hands to his heart.</p>

<p>In silence she let him go, but a
passionate prayer burst from her
lips as soon as he had crossed the
threshold. She shaded the flickering
light with one hand, while she
stepped forth and strained her eyes
after him as far as sight could follow.
When he disappeared behind
a corner, a sob broke from her, and
she turned wearily to go up the
stairs. A cloud scudded across
the face of the moon, and the shrill
laugh of a woman sounded clear
and cutting down the street. Grace
went back to the little room, where
the fire was sullenly going to sleep,
waking up now and then in a fretful,
spectre-like glare and a weird
rustle, then leaving utter darkness
behind once more. The girl shuddered;
she knew not what ailed her.
Thoughts came in upon her, maddening
her, and she paced up and
down the small enclosure with
rapid, unsteady steps. She had
never felt like this before; when
her mother lay dying, she had stepped
lightly and softly, her mind
clear, her loving heart calm, though
crushed. What meant this fever,
this horror of something vague,
this dread that made her heart beat
as the wind creaked the wooden
stairs and shook the ill-fitting casement?
A crucifix hung on the
wall, a Bible lay on the table; to
both she looked for comfort and
peace, but the one seemed alive
with ruddy blood-stains, and the
other opened at these words: "I
said, In the midst of my days I shall
go to the gates of hell; I sought
for the residue of my years.... I
hoped till morning; as a lion so
hath he broken all my bones: from
morning even to night thou wilt
make an end of me."<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> Grace closed
the book with pale cheeks and
scared expression, and flung herself
on her knees before the burnt-out
fire. She sank to the ground, and
a kind of mist seemed to dull her
senses; yet it was not sleep. A
child awoke in the room overhead,
and began its wailing, peevish cry;
otherwise the stillness was intense.
The moon climbed the sky so that
its light went beyond the range of
the low window; the radiance came,
however, wan and misty, up from
the street. The clock in the passage
ticked, and Grace found herself
unconsciously counting its pulses;
and when she tried to break off,
a spell seemed upon her that compelled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_812" id="Page_812">[Pg 812]</a></span>her to count on. Again she
paced the room, and then, as if
impatient of this unaccountable
restlessness, she began to make
things ready for her father's return.
This occupied her some time, and
she lingered over the homely task as
if in it lay a talisman to shield her
against this nameless fear, this importunate,
impalpable horror, that
seemed to her almost a <em>presence</em>.
She said aloud, to cheat her own
belief, "I must be ill; this is fever;"
but her mind was pitilessly alive,
and refused this interpretation.
She sat down to read; philosophy
would surely drive away the unholy
phantom. But the pages grew dim
before her eyes, and, though unclosed,
those eyes saw nothing of what
was before them. Twenty times
she rose up to look at the passage
clock; the time lagged, she thought,
as if it dreaded to become the present.
The fire burnt brightly again,
and hot wine and water were ready
on the table. A few flowers that
stood in a common cup on the
mantel-piece she took down and
laid gracefully in a shallow saucer,
placing it on the table, in green
and scarlet contrast with the white,
transparent flagon, and the quaint
old silver ewer. Then she thought,
as if forcing her mind to leave her
unnamed dread behind, of the many
vicissitudes this piece of Howard
plate had seen; of the drinking
bouts of old at which it had figured
in the days of the reckless cavaliers;
of the mediæval honors it might
have won at jousts and tournaments;
for its date was carved on a
small shield up-born by a griffin and
a monk, and went far back into
the XVth century. But this speculation
was disturbed by sounds of
horrid revel in the street, and
Grace shiveringly met the old horror
face to face again. Something
half human seemed to brood over
the place; the room seemed tenanted,
and, though brave, the girl was
thoroughly unnerved. She opened
the door, the clock ticked, and she
saw it was growing late. From the
impatience of two hours ago she
rushed back into a shrinking dread
of the lateness of the time, now it
had come. Her father was still away&mdash;why?
Had he not looked forward
to a quiet evening after his work of
charity was done, and would he not
have hurried home, that she might
not have to wait long after the usual
hour? The shadowy terror that
all the time had obstinately kept <em>his</em>
form as a sort of centre round
which it could turn and play in
fantastic dreams and ever-changing
pictures, crept nearer to her heart
now, and strangled it with a more
certain fear, a more defined vision.
Then a cold wind seemed to blow
all round her, and she looked up.
It was only the open door into the
passage that was swinging on its
grating hinges, and letting in a rush
of air from the outside. Yes; but
whence was the cold air that wrung
the frail door? Was not that a
sound on the stairs? Her first impulse
was to rush out, and meet her
father; her second, a scarcely
shaped wish to prolong the yet
doubtful present. Irresolutely she
stood and listened; there were
voices on the stairs&mdash;whispers.</p>

<p>Then a slow tread came lingeringly
up, and through the half-open
door she saw Edmund Oakhurst.
She knew it all now. Had he rushed
up with maddening speed, as if
human feet were not swift enough
for his errand, she might have hoped.
As it was, she saw it all; and
when he spoke, she only answered:
"Yes."</p>

<p>He stood silent then, and, taking
her hand, waited for her to ask him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_813" id="Page_813">[Pg 813]</a></span>
where she must follow him. She
passed her other hand over her
forehead, and then pointed to the
table, with a sort of pathetic smile
that wrung her lover's heart.</p>

<p>"He was to have had a nice
evening, he said," she murmured
in a dreary tone. Oakhurst hardly
knew whether or no to answer.</p>

<p>"Come, show me," she said
again, taking her shawl, and wrapping
it round her, and then, taking
the crucifix from the wall, she
kissed it and passed it to Edmund.</p>

<p>"My only father now," she
whispered to herself. They went
down the old stairs in silence, the
frightened landlady standing at the
door, trembling like an aspen-leaf.</p>

<p>"Tell me," said Grace when
they were in the street, "how was
it? Did he fall?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he fell," answered he,
hesitating; she saw it.</p>

<p>"You can tell me all," she said
dreamily; "he was getting short-sighted;
from study, you know.
Did he stumble? Or was it something
struck him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he was coming out of the
house&mdash;standing near the door&mdash;it
did not hurt him much, and he was
insensible."</p>

<p>"And was it all over at once?"</p>

<p>"Before we could get him to the
hospital."</p>

<p>"Was there a doctor?"</p>

<p>"One came, and accompanied
him to the hospital. But he said
nothing could be done."</p>

<p>"Did he speak?"</p>

<p>"Not once; but he opened his
eyes and looked around, as if seeking
something. I said 'Grace,'
and then a light came to his eyes,
but otherwise there was no recognition.
I hardly think he knew
me."</p>

<p>"I had his blessing before he left
me, thank God!"</p>

<p>Silence fell upon them, and Grace
sobbed softly now and then. She
thought of the grave under the
elms, and of the meeting of those
two&mdash;those to whom she owed her
being&mdash;and then of her own lonely
heart left behind to drag out its
weary vigil. Her self-possession
was returning, and when she
reached the hospital, it was no
wailing, unconscious maniac whom
they led to the couch of the calm
sleeper, but a grave, silent woman,
wrapped in the majesty of sorrow,
armed with the shield of peace.
She stood a few moments steadfastly
by the bed, then dropped on her
knees, and kissed the white, still
hand. A gash had scarred the high,
broad forehead, but its horror had
been obliterated as much as possible,
and she felt no shrinking. Her
long, piercing gaze had made her
more strangely calm; a half-smile
came to her lips as she thought of
the shuddering girl who had stood
in formless terror, trembling at
every shadow, a few hours since;
she could hardly believe that it was
herself, so much had the reality of
awful grief sobered in her the wild
instincts of dimly perceived danger.
The blow had come, and with it
the grace; the balm had been poured
in almost by the same hand that
had dealt the wound, and the burden
laid upon her had found more
than strength enough whereon to
rest and weigh. Crushed she
might be, but had not the same
silent teacher she gazed upon now
been as crushed as she by a widely
different yet kindred loss, and had
not his soul risen again from under
the flail with ten times more sweetness
in its fragrance, and more
strength in its tempered fibre?</p>

<p>She turned and whispered to
Edmund. He inclined his head,
and, speaking authoritatively, said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_814" id="Page_814">[Pg 814]</a></span>
to the bystanders that the body
must be, at Miss Seymour's wish,
carried to her lodgings. She then
left, and he accompanied her home,
promising to return with her father's
corpse.</p>

<p>In a short time muffled steps
and hushed voices were heard, and
the strong man was borne again to
the home he had left so cheerfully
only a few hours before. Edmund
and Grace were alone. All night
through they watched, and a few
candles burned round the sleeping
form. Towards the gray of the
morning, when common sounds
began to be heard again, and the
city woke up once more to its never-intermitted
round of strange, wicked,
checkered life, the girl, rising
and kissing the brow of her dead
father, turned to Edmund with a
sad look of inquiry.</p>

<p>"Edmund," she said slowly, "you
never told me what struck him."</p>

<p>"An iron bar," he answered,
with a frightened, startled look.
She gazed full in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I do not believe," she said
calmly, with sad reproach trembling
in her voice, "that you have
told me untruly, for that you could
not do; but, through kindness and
compassion, I <em>know</em> that you have
not told me <em>all</em>."</p>

<p>"What more is there to tell?"
he stammered.</p>

<p>"You know," she answered;
"for God's sake, tell me!"</p>

<p>He looked at her with strange
meaning. "You do not know what
you are asking, Grace. I had hoped,
if I had had my way, to keep
from you much that would cause
you unnecessary sorrow; and you
could have left town, and even the
country, so as to more completely
take from you all association with
this terrible grief. But you seem
to pierce every veil, and I am not
practised at concealing. But, O
Grace! it will break your heart!
It well-nigh breaks my own to think
of it!"</p>

<p>"I know there is something very
dreadful in the background," she
said; "but I have prayed all night
for strength to bear it, and I wish
to know it now. Do not hide one
thing from me, as you hope for
heaven, Edmund."</p>

<p>He paused, and then, thinking
that it would be best to get the
shock over at once, said, intently
watching her the while: "Grace,
your father was called of God to
be a priest. But God made him a
martyr first; for such a murder <em>is</em>, in
truth, a martyrdom."</p>

<p>She quivered from head to foot,
but, recovering herself, she said:
"I had suspected something like
that."</p>

<p>"How, Grace?"</p>

<p>"I thought I heard some whispered
words that were hushed as
soon as I went in to that awful
place where he lay, and I had seen
you flush, and blanch, and hesitate
when I questioned you. It was
God's will. Tell me everything.
But who"&mdash;and her voice broke
here&mdash;"who could have been so
lost as to hate <em>him</em>?"</p>

<p>"You know, when we left you,"
hurriedly began the young man,
"we went straight to that meeting.
Some were there who are as good
as cured, and some others came
from curiosity, or brought by their
friends. A few were not sober.
Your father said some prayers, as
usual. Then he spoke to the men,
as you know he can speak, very
simply, very earnestly. There was
a disturbance at the door. While
he was speaking, half a dozen men,
furious with drink, and roaring and
swearing like demons, tried to get
in. A few opposed them, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_815" id="Page_815">[Pg 815]</a></span>
the struggle the rickety door came
down, and the long, old-fashioned
iron hinge came loose from the
rotten wood. One of the men
took it up&mdash;it was Drake, the son
of those poor old cripples. Another,
who was of our men inside, wrenched
it from him, and your father
came down near the door to try
and quiet the men. Those of the
better sort grouped round him,
fearing violence from the men in
the front. I was close to him. I
saw a man stoop, and the next
minute Drake passed something to
a comrade of his, who stole behind
us, while he himself made a rush
at me. I was still grappling with
him, when there was a cry. The
men sprang apart, and I heard
your father say, 'O God!' just as
he fell. I flung Drake to the
ground with such force that he was
stunned, and his head sounded dead
on the stone floor. The men on
our side had already caught the
murderer, with the long iron hinge
in his hand. It had struck your
father on the back of the head,
near the ear, and the scar on the
forehead was made by falling forward.
The police did not come
till it was all over, and then they
marched off Drake and the other
man&mdash;Eldridge is his name, so I
was told afterwards. I heard
Drake say, with a horrible oath,
that it was lucky for your father he
had escaped so long; and the murderer
grinned as he heard this remark.
They seemed sober enough
the minute it was over. Drake recovered
very soon. The other men
seemed stupid with horror. Grace,
was it not a martyrdom?"</p>

<p>"Edmund," she answered solemnly,
"it was the noblest death
he could die, the only one befitting
him. Die for the good
of others! die for the spread of
holiness, for the honor of principle!
die that God might be better
known and better served!&mdash;it was
what he lived for; it was what he
would have chosen to die for, had
he had the choice. O my father!
half my soul has gone with
him, and my life shall be one eager
longing to be made worthy to follow
him. Edmund, is it not grand,
is it not heroic? Has he not a
glorious crown wherewith to meet
my mother in heaven?"</p>

<p>Edmund could not help wondering
at the quaint suggestions, which,
to his less imaginative nature,
seemed even extravagant; but when
was enthusiasm ever less than extravagant,
and when was it more
meet than in this case of a glorious,
God-ordained death?</p>

<p>After a pause, Grace resumed:</p>

<p>"If I had known this sooner, I
should have gone to Drake's parents.
I shall go now. You watch
while I am away."</p>

<p>And before Edmund could speak,
she was gone.</p>

<p>They were sitting over the embers
of a mere apology for a fire,
these two forsaken cripples, with
the little, starveling children cuddled
together like frightened rabbits
at their feet. When the door
opened, and Grace appeared, pale
and worn, they shivered, and leaned
one upon the other, as if they
would gladly have fled from her,
had they been able. They were
dumb, and seemed to have no instinct
but fear within their bosoms.
The children stared with great
round eyes, and crept further away.
Grace went up, and knelt down before
the old couple, taking the woman's
fingers in her own, and saying
softly:</p>

<p>"You are not afraid of me?
Did you think I was angry? I
have come to tell you I am not, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_816" id="Page_816">[Pg 816]</a></span>
<em>he</em> would not be, could he speak to
you. Won't you say something to
me?"</p>

<p>The old woman said something,
but her teeth chattered so it was
unintelligible. The old man gave
a feeble, idiotic laugh, and, for the
moment, Grace was startled. But
she soon saw that horror had turned
his brain, and that he was now
beyond the possibility of suffering.
His wife seemed verging on the
same state. Grace took out some
money, and put it into the poor old
crone's hand. "You shall live on
here, just as usual," she said. "I will
help you; never mind. Take care
of your husband, and remember I
am not angry with you."</p>

<p>The old woman mumbled something
under her breath, but appeared
quite stupefied yet. "God
bless you!" said Grace sadly, turning
from this unsatisfactory couple,
and going gently up to the children.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me where Eldridge
lived?" she said. "And if
he has a family?"</p>

<p>The children, also, seemed deaf
and dumb for a time; but at last
the promise of a silver piece drew
forth from the recesses of their
memory the address of Eldridge's
wife. It was not far off. Grace
left the hovel, and took her way
down courts and by-streets till she
reached the house where the murderer's
wife lived. Up many stairs,
and through many passages, inquiring
her way, Grace went, and
at last knocked at the right door.
Only a sound of sobbing was heard
within. She said to herself, "This
is no hardened woman;" and at
once her resolve was formed. She
gently opened the door; a woman
sat by the dingy window, her head
buried in her hands, and bent down
to her knees. She rocked herself
to and fro, and moaned at regular
intervals. A child lay in a cradle
near her, but she did not heed it.
The bed stood at one end of the
room, tossed and untidy; the poor
little utensils of the wretched home
were flung about in disorder, and
some dark stains on the deal table
gave out a strong, sickening odor.</p>

<p>Grace went up to the woman,
and touched her on the shoulder.
The woman looked up. Her face
was wild and sad, the hair strayed
over the cheeks and forehead, matted
with tears, and the expression
was awful in its utter despair.
Grace said:</p>

<p>"You are very unhappy; I am
come to comfort you, if you will let
me."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" said the woman
vacantly.</p>

<p>"A friend to all who are in trouble,"
answered Grace, with a sob
in her voice; "and I thought, if I
came to you, it might relieve you."</p>

<p>The woman seemed to try and
gather her faculties together. "I
do not remember you. The visiting
ladies is not like you."</p>

<p>"But you will let me visit you?
Perhaps I can do you more good
than they can."</p>

<p>"No, no; you are very kind, lady,
but 'tan't no use."</p>

<p>"I know what your trouble is,
but there is comfort even for that
sorrow. He may repent; have you
any influence over him?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. Grace
pointed to the cradle.</p>

<p>"And has that no influence upon
him? To-day, when he is sober,
it may have. Take the baby, and
go and see him. If you do him
good, it will make you happier; if
not, you will have done your
duty."</p>

<p>"Duty!" flashed out the miserable
woman. "What have I ever
done but my duty, and to him as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_817" id="Page_817">[Pg 817]</a></span>
used me more as a beast than a
woman?"</p>

<p>"Hush! hush! God may touch
him yet. Do not despair!"</p>

<p>"Not despair! Lady, it's easy
for you as is a lady to say sech
things! God be merciful to me, I'm
driven mad with despair!"</p>

<p>"Will you tell me what it is that
troubles your poor heart?" said
Grace, who saw that the unhappy
woman must speak out or die.</p>

<p>"Won't I?" was the answer, fearfully
prompt. "I married that
man three years ago down in Devonshire,
and I a farmer's daughter,
with a home as never knowed the
want of anything. And he fooled
me with his handsome face and
talk of Lunnon, and his fine trade
there. Trade, indeed! It was the
devil's trade, if any! And because
I listened and liked him, my father
he swore he'd disown me. I
ran away, and we was married at
the nearest church. First night,
he came home drunk. He never
left off being drunk, and often I
thought I'd leave him; but father,
he wouldn't have taken me back,
and I didn't want for to be called
names! Here in Lunnon we lived
sometimes here, sometimes there,
worse than this often, and he always
drunk. He had heaps of
money now and then. I know,
lady, where it come from; but he
never gave me any, and I don't
know as I could have touched it if
he had. But for days he left me,
and I had to beg or starve; he
would not have cared if I'd done
worse. Then come home drunk,
and swear because there was nothing
to eat. He beat me and kicked
me, and, when he come home,
wouldn't let me sleep at night.
Other men came, too, and spoke
about bad things in whispers; but I
heard. They would drink here till
they all slept heavy on the floor,
and the brandy spilt over their
clothes. Then baby was born, and
I felt as if I could kill it first; for why
bring it up to be like its father?
Three days after it came, my husband
struck me terrible, and I
nearly died. He gave brandy to
the child, and I in a faint. Baby
was like to die, and I were glad of
it. And so it went on&mdash;baby better,
but me worse, and drink, drink, till
he sometimes went tearing mad,
swore he saw devils, and called
for more drink and more. A few
months ago, Drake came&mdash;a man
my husband knew&mdash;and he and the
other laughed and said 'some one'
shouldn't trouble them long. They
had money, in gold, last time I saw
Drake. That was four days back.
Then my husband, he came home
drunk still, and every night it was
the same, till last night, when he
did not come home at all, but left
me not one half-penny, for he had
drunk the last in that brandy he
spilt on the table."</p>

<p>The woman paused and shuddered.</p>

<p>"My God, my God!" she moaned,
"that I should come to this,
with my father's home, so peaceful-like,
and me not daring to go
back. Well, the last I heard of
that man were when, at twelve
o'clock last night, a neighbor rushed
in and says to me, says she, 'Mrs.
Eldridge, your old man's been and
done it!' And as I looked at her,
stupid-like, she says, 'He's killed
that preaching gentleman as used
to try and get all our men to leave off
spirits.' And I fell back on the bed,
and knowed nothing for hours."</p>

<p>Grace had listened throughout
the pitiful story with calm, patient
interest; she now said soothingly:</p>

<p>"Come, Mrs. Eldridge, it is a
fearful blow, but God tempers the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_818" id="Page_818">[Pg 818]</a></span>
wind to the shorn lamb, does he
not? Tell me, you have not tasted
anything since yesterday; is it not
so? You must be faint, and, if we
would bear up against sorrow, we
must not lose our health. I have
brought you money, but I think it
is better I should send for some
things for you, as you will hardly
care to go out and be seen just
now."</p>

<p>"Indeed and indeed it's true,"
sobbed the poor creature; "but you
are a world too good, miss."</p>

<p>"I will read to you while you
are waiting; it will soothe you,"
said Grace, as she went to the door,
and called a girl from one of the
multitudinous cavities of this warren-like
house. She gave her money
and instructions, and turned back
into the room. The child in the
cradle awoke. Grace took it up.
The mother shuddered, saying:
"Better it should die, lady, than
live to be like its father."</p>

<p>The girl looked curiously down
at the infant's poor, pinched face,
and then answered:</p>

<p>"Let God settle that; it is not
for you or I to question his doings
towards children. I remember my
little brother when he was like
this."</p>

<p>"Ah! miss, no doubt he had a
different father."</p>

<p>Grace turned pale, and did not
answer. The woman was silent,
but seemed merged in her own
grief again. Then, with the child
on her lap, the young girl began to
read out of a Catholic Bible she had
in her pocket. She thought Mrs.
Eldridge would never know the difference,
and she preferred her father's
gift to herself to all the
Bibles she had had during his pastorship.
The poor woman seemed
entranced. When Grace paused,
she said:</p>

<p>"Them visiting ladies never does
that, but they brings tracts and
groceries. But how peaceful-like
that do sound jest like our parson's
daughter as used to read to
mother at home."</p>

<p>"How old are you, Mrs. Eldridge?"
asked Grace.</p>

<p>"Going twenty-four, miss. But,
ah! I was a different woman when
I got married. If you had a-seen
me then, lady, you would not believe
it was me."</p>

<p>And, in truth, the poor, wasted
face looked old, and hungry, and
thin, as if the spirit had aged so
that it grew jealous of the once
comely mask without, and withered
it remorselessly with watching, and
weepings, and sharp care. The
little messenger came back to the
door, bearing with her creature
comforts, whose taste had long
been unknown to the drunkard's
wife. Then Grace rose to leave
her, saying, "You shall not want, my
poor friend; and whenever you
wish to see your husband, I will try
and manage it for you. If there
is any possibility of saving him, it
shall be done. While there is life,
there is hope&mdash;of the soul as well
as of the body. He might repent
and be a help and an example to
you. And then, no doubt, his
wicked companions tempted him
much, and the sin was perhaps not
all his own. So look to God, and
try and bear up, and I will come
again."</p>

<p>She left the house with a pure
joy at her heart, praying to God
that he would keep her for ever in
the path on which she had entered,
and feeling that, in her weak measure,
she had been permitted to bring
herself a little nearer to the ideal
of her dead father's life. She had
laid upon his tomb a garland worthy
of him, she had said words his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_819" id="Page_819">[Pg 819]</a></span>
spirit would have approved, and
done a deed such as he himself
would have bidden her do.</p>

<p>Back again to the dark, silent
chamber of the dead she went, and
found her watchful lover there; but
she did not tell him that she had
sought out the murderer's wife.
That day came various torturing
details, but she allowed Oakhurst
to spare her much of their sorrow,
and throughout the legal proceedings
she never had to appear.
The murder caused some stir, as
the victim was an American citizen
and the father of the young heir
of the Howards. George Charteris
visited his cousin, and offered her
his services in every way, professional
or friendly, that she might
choose. She was touched by his
ready sympathy, but wisely refused
his <em>professional</em> assistance.</p>

<p>"You see, George," she said, "it
would seem ungenerous to have
one so nearly related to him to
plead against his murderer; besides,
I would rather save the unhappy
man from his due punishment, if it
can be done."</p>

<p>"What, Cousin Grace!" he
echoed, unable to understand her.</p>

<p>"It seems strange to you, I know;
but I have not lived with my father
all my life without knowing well
how full of Christian charity he always
was when any personal injury
was done to him, and I am
following his will, no less than the
Christian precepts, when I say I
would spare his unhappy murderer
as much as lays in my power."</p>

<p>"My dear child, this is perfect
quixotism. A fellow who should
have been hung long ago!"</p>

<p>"I know you think differently;
it is natural you should. You
judge things by another standard,
and from another point of view.
Looked at in the light of the Gospel,
things are very different, dear
cousin. Do not let us speak about
it. If it is romance to you; it is
life and truth to me."</p>

<p>"For George's sake! Think what
it will be when he learns it by-and-by!"</p>

<p>"You will not tell him now?"
she asked in sudden alarm, clasping
her hands. "Oh! do not, do not!
My mother gave me that boy to
watch over and guard from sin
with my very life, but God has
willed that his angel should be
alone to watch him; yet I must ask
you, if you have any influence, do
not breed thoughts of wicked revenge
in his mind&mdash;oh! do not, for,
if you do, not only he will suffer, but
it will fall back upon you all as a
curse. God has made this to happen
in his childhood, as if on purpose
to hide it from him; do not,
for pity's sake, run counter to the
evident decrees of Providence."</p>

<p>Reluctantly George Charteris
promised his cousin he would exert
his influence to keep the father's
murder a secret from the child.
And so passed the terrible weeks
of waiting, Grace ministering almost
daily help to the wretched
murderer's wife, and Edmund seeking
to soothe her whom he loved
so tenderly and so reverently. A
priest was found to give a quiet
blessing to the unconscious form
they both had loved so well, and
then the dark earth hid the body
away, and sowed one more seed for
the mystic coming harvest, which
shall clothe the valley of judgment
with such marvellous blossoming
beauty.</p>

<p>When the final conviction of the
prisoner and his sentence of capital
punishment were made known,
Grace was the first to break the
news to the wretched wife, and the
only one to soothe these dire tid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_820" id="Page_820">[Pg 820]</a></span>ings
with suggestions of hope and
mercy. The poor woman still refused
to visit her husband, and it
was more the shame of his crime,
and the ignominy of his approaching
death, than any spark of feeling
left within her bosom for the man
who had wooed and won her, that
tortured her heart and bowed her
head. Grace tried repeatedly to
soften her, to melt the terrible callousness
which was alive only to
the earthly aspect of her grief; but
for many weeks she tried in vain.
The wild, horror-struck eyes of the
unfortunate creature would fasten
themselves upon her as she spoke&mdash;burning
orbs, with unspeakable defiance
in them, as if, from this day
forth, the felon's wife felt herself
to be a hunted creature, with the
brand of her husband's sin undeservedly
scathing her future life
and that of her unconscious child.</p>

<p>When Grace hinted of a possible
pardon, the poor thing stared with
a frightened expression that only
seemed to say: "And I must be
his slave again," as if the thought
of her own bondage were the only
thing on earth that could move her.
But at last, being appealed to in
the name of her own self-respect,
she seemed to have a dawning sense
that her present course was hardly
the one to elevate her once again
into the sphere of tranquil content
whence her husband's degradation
had, three short years ago, so fatally
withdrawn her. The dikes of her
soul burst suddenly, and the flood
of sweet memories of past days,
and of the happy hours spent in the
old farm-house, of the flood of womanliness
and pity, of the sensibility
of the mother, of the forbearance
of the Christian, broke over her in
saving waves, each teaching the
same lesson in their infinite variety
of tenderest human voices. She
rose, took her child in her arms,
and followed her young protectress
nearly as far as the prison. Grace
would go no further, but agreed to
wait till the interview with the condemned
man was over. The woman
came out weeping and softened.
Her husband was at least not
obdurate, and expressed sincere regret
for what he had been led to
do. He bade his wife implore of
the unknown lady who had so generously
befriended them to accept
the blessing he was not worthy to
give, but which nevertheless was
the last and only tribute a dying
man could offer. Grace shuddered
as this message was conveyed to
her through tears and sobs, but her
companion was too greatly busied
with her own griefs to notice it.</p>

<p>One evening, as Edmund Oakhurst
sat, with his promised wife, in
the room the presence of the dead
had hallowed to their simple, trusting
hearts, he was astonished at
her unusual agitation, and at the remark
she quietly made as the expression
of it.</p>

<p>"Edmund, I am going to get a
reprieve for Eldridge, and that may
lead to a commutation of sentence.
He is very penitent, I hear, and, for
his wife's sake, I should wish it."</p>

<p>"But, Grace," replied her lover,
with characteristic common sense,
"if he is penitent and well-prepared,
it would be safer even for his own
soul's sake that he should suffer
the full penalty of the law."</p>

<p>"We are no judges of that, Edmund,"
she answered, her bright
eyes turning, with suppressed enthusiasm,
towards the open window,
all bathed in wintry sunlight. "God,
I think, must mean otherwise for
him, or else he would never have
put this idea in my mind. I have
thought of it ever since he lay
there" (pointing to the centre of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_821" id="Page_821">[Pg 821]</a></span>
the room, where the dear dead had
rested), "and his spirit seemed to
whisper it constantly to my heart,
as if it were some message of God's
mercy, of which he vouchsafed to
make us the bearers to the rulers of
earth."</p>

<p>"Grace, I thought your training
would have led you a different way.
I thought you would be the first to
see God's hand in the established
law. Darling, this is sentimentalism.
You can forgive the wretched man,
and pray for him, and help the
forsaken ones he leaves behind,
without hindering the law in its
operations. You will have fulfilled
the Christian duty of forgiveness,
without interfering with another
sphere of equally binding duty on
the community."</p>

<p>"I think you might be right in
an ordinary case, Edmund, but
God seems to put this beyond common
rules, to me."</p>

<p>"Is that not pride, Grace?"</p>

<p>"I trust not," she replied, gently
but firmly; "it is a call, a command
from God, just as my father's conversion,
and my still more unexpected
one, were calls from on
high&mdash;direct calls that took our
hearts by storm."</p>

<p>"Grace, dear, I cannot help
thinking it presumptuous in you
to dream of these things; you
make them miracles almost!"</p>

<p>"Surely not, Edmund. Supposing
a king were to send for his
servant, and give him some important
order to transmit, which, in
the ordinary course of things,
should have been conveyed through
his prime minister; do you think
the servant would be justified in
feeling proud, or the person who
received the order in feeling hurt,
at the unusual way in which the
king had been pleased to act?"</p>

<p>"Grace!" exclaimed Edmund,
"you talk just as your father used!
He always made me feel that he
was right. I will not attempt to
influence you any longer; I will
leave the matter in the hands of
God, and pray that you may be
guided by him. If I were you, I
would speak with a priest, though!"</p>

<p>"I have, dearest," answered
Grace, looking less rapt, and perhaps
mingling with her high
thoughts a little unconscious human
spice of innocent triumph.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said her lover, and, smiling,
he relapsed into silence. After
incredible efforts and unflagging
energy had been spent upon the
task, Grace succeeded in getting her
father's murderer first reprieved,
then re-sentenced to transportation
for life. The shock of this news,
the utter stupor of gratitude into
which he was thrown, even though
the name of his benefactress still
remained a mystery to him, wrought
a miracle in his nature, and sobered
him for life. Faith came to the
help of solemn thankfulness, and the
husband and wife secretly became
Catholics before leaving England.
Grace, for some inexplicable reason,
positively refused to see Eldridge,
even at his wife's most earnest request.
The fact was that she had
once been face to face with him, in
days when neither dreamed of the
strange relations they were fated to
bear to each other, and she feared,
in her humility, lest he recognize
her now. But Edmund, fully aware
as he was of how matters stood,
resolved that, without wounding
his betrothed's sweet lowliness, he
would yet reveal to the recipients
of her charity the inestimable sacrifice
she had made of her natural
feelings for the sake of the "new
commandment" of love and forgiveness
taught by Christ's Gospel.
So while the four stood in a group<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_822" id="Page_822">[Pg 822]</a></span>
just before the departure of the convict-ship&mdash;Grace
far apart with the
mother, and her back turned to the
convict&mdash;he slipped into the hand
of the murderer a folded paper, saying
something under his breath of its
being of some little pecuniary use
to them in their new home, and
adding with a half-smile:</p>

<p>"<em>She</em> knows nothing of it, but her
name is written inside. Do not
open it till you are on board."</p>

<p>Grace, meanwhile, was comforting
the mother, whose little boy was in
her arms for the last time, as Grace
had wished to have it brought up
under her own care.</p>

<p>"I have a little brother, you
know," she said, "and, while I cannot
fulfil my mother's trust with
regard to him, I will lavish all my
care on your child, and, please God,
in a few years, when your husband
earns his freedom, you shall see the
boy again in my country, where
nothing but good will ever be known
of any of you."</p>

<p>So the ship sailed, and the convict's
hand clasped the paper nervously.
The mother was holding out her
arms to her little boy, who struggled
and cried in Grace's embrace. The
man, standing on the deck, touched
his wife's shoulder, and passed the
paper to her. Had any one been
close enough, he might have seen
the swarthy cheek pale to a sickly
hue, then flush as suddenly again.
Those on shore only saw his face
swiftly hidden in his hands, and his
whole frame rock violently. Simultaneously
the woman dropped on the
deck, and Grace thought she must
have fainted with the grief of leaving
her child behind. Indeed, she was
too much occupied with the little one
to notice the ship minutely. The
poor babe wailed and then struggled
by turns, and it was no easy
work to keep it quiet till the small
party could find a coach to take
them home. Edmund took care to
look unconcerned and innocent,
and, thanks to his betrothed's sweet
unsuspiciousness of disposition, as
also to the circumstances we have
mentioned, his secret was kept until
a passionately grateful letter from
the poor convict reached her in her
own home across the ocean. Edmund
was her husband by that time,
and she could not find it in her heart
not to forgive him!</p>

<p>But we are slightly anticipating.</p>

<p>A few days after the departure
of the convict-ship, George Charteris
called on his cousin, to report
to her about certain arrangements
which he had volunteered to take
on his own hands. He had now
completed them, and had found a
responsible and aged companion for
Grace on her homeward voyage.
The old lady was going out to some
relations settled in Virginia, and
was delighted to find a young girl
of refinement and of good family to
bear her company on her somewhat
tedious journey.</p>

<p>Edmund had begged Grace Seymour
to consent to be married before
they left England; but the girl
had some unaccountable longing
for her own land, which, though he
smiled at as childish, he nevertheless
was too chivalrous to combat.
He was to follow speedily, with
George Charteris as groomsman,
and an older friend, a priest bound
for some of the Indian missions.</p>

<p>So the ocean was crossed once
more, and in her own home, the beautiful
marriage-gift she brought her
husband, Grace Seymour was married.
Mr. Ashmead, whom, with
characteristic courtesy, she would
not exclude from her quiet, unattended
wedding, told her solemnly, as he
walked by her side to her mother's
grave under the thick-shaded elms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_823" id="Page_823">[Pg 823]</a></span>
that he had had a secret once, which
he wished to tell her now.</p>

<p>In grave wonderment she turned
her eyes upon him. "My child,"
he said sadly, but with no shame
flushing his clear cheek, "I once
dreamt to have you for my own,
and I waited from the moment I
saw you first, standing here, bending
down to look into the unfilled
grave, till I saw your mind unfolding
and blossoming, as in a cloistered
garden, all alone; but when I
knew that your faith was disturbed,
my heart bled for you and for myself,
for I saw that I had no spell
wherewith to give you back what
you had lost. And since the day
your father left us, the dream
faded as a thing that God had ordained
not to be. So now, though
our faiths are widely different, and
though the memory of those times
is very dear to me still, I can take
your hand in all a father's freedom,
and give you and your husband a
father's blessing. Let us be friends
for ever, Grace, will you?"</p>

<p>She had listened to him with a
bright blush and attentive expression;
she now took his hand, and
said earnestly: "Yes, Mr. Ashmead;
God bless you!"</p>

<p>The years sped on. Edmund
Oakhurst soon owned estates that
would have thrice bought the old
homestead of his wife's early days;
his fields were the fullest, his experiments
the most successful, his
men the best cared for, his profits
the largest, his prosperity the most
steady, in the whole country around.
People left off calling him the
"Britisher," and spoke respectfully
of him as the "Squire"; even his
religion was favorably regarded in
consideration of his position and
his well-known generosity. Children
like himself rose up around
him, and the convict's child seemed
only like the elder brother of the
rest. Things gradually changed,
and Catholic schools and colleges
made their appearance in the land.
Oakhurst thought it more prudent
to send his sons and his so-called
nephew to American centres of
Catholic education, rather than to
the more advanced universities of
France; but he reserved for home-teaching
the nameless refinement
he wished to stamp on his children.
His wife was the worthy successor
of her mother, whose sweet presence
had once been so dear to the
villagers of Walcot; only <em>her</em> silent
influence was now directed to that
end which, after death, had become
that of her mother too.</p>

<p>When, fifteen years later, the man
who had left England a convict
landed in America an emigrant, he
found his oldest boy studying for
the priesthood, and fast and enthusiastically
outstripping his companion
and rival in theological learning,
Oakhurst's own second son.
Again another change and another
joy had been added to Grace's life,
when her brother, on attaining his
majority, came over with his uncle,
George Charteris, now a tolerably
well-behaved married man, and
paid her a long visit within the
walls of the old home, untouched
and unchanged from what he recollected,
save by accumulation of
mosses, and a denser growth of
creepers round the gables and the
porch.</p>

<p>They have all gone to their rest
now, these friends with whom we
have been treading the past&mdash;all,
save the sons of Grace and Edmund,
and their only daughter,
who afterwards married George
Howard's son and heir. The
old name that had been alternately
the watchword of Catholicism
and Low-Churchism in Glou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_824" id="Page_824">[Pg 824]</a></span>cestershire
veered round again in
their persons to its first allegiance,
and contributed unwavering steadfastness
to the sum of heroic courage
shown forth by that army
whose chiefs in England are called
Newman, and Manning, and that
modern S. Bernardine of Sienna,
Frederick Faber.</p>

<p>Walcot, too, though of Puritan
breeding, knows the sound of Catholic
bells now, and the priest's
house is the unchanged old Seymour
cottage, while the pastor
himself is the English convict's
child.</p>

<p>Edmund Seymour's sacrifice had
sown the first grain of which Grace
Oakhurst's children reaped a hundred-fold.</p>

<h3>THE PRINCIPLES OF REAL BEING.</h3>


<h4>III.<br />

INTRINSIC PRINCIPLES OF PRIMITIVE BEINGS.</h4>

<p>We have shown in a preceding
article<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> that every primitive being
proceeds from three extrinsic principles&mdash;the
<em>final</em>, the <em>efficient</em>, and, if
we may so call it, the <em>eductional</em> or
<em>pro-material</em> principle; that is, the
term out of which the being is
educed, which term, as we there remarked,
holds the place of the material
principle still wanting.</p>

<p>We are now ready to prove that
every primitive being has also <em>three
intrinsic principles</em>, not more, and
not fewer&mdash;a truth the knowledge
of which is of the utmost importance
in philosophy, as it enables
the student to point out without
hesitation everything that may enter
into the constitution of primitive
beings, with the gratifying certainty
that, when he has once reached the
said three principles, his analysis
is perfect, and can go no further.
But as our proposition is altogether
universal, its demonstration will
need the employment of arguments
drawn from the most abstract of all
philosophical notions; and our
readers must bear with us if we fill
a portion of the following pages
with dry, though not abstruse, reasonings.
The determination of the
first constituents of things needs
precision, not ornament, as it is
nothing more than the drawing of
the outlines by which the whole
building of metaphysics is to be encompassed.</p>

<p>Our first proof is based on the
following consideration. Of every
existing being two things are cognizable:
the first, <em>that it is</em>, the
second, <em>what it is</em>. In other terms,
all complete being is knowable both
as to its <em>existence</em> and as to its nature
or <em>essence</em>. But while the existence
of any given being is simply
<em>affirmed</em> as a fact, the essence is
<em>understood</em> as an object. Now,
nothing can be understood which
does not present itself to the intellect
under the form of an intelligible
ratio; for to understand is to
see a relation of things, as <em>intelligere</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_825" id="Page_825">[Pg 825]</a></span>
is nothing but <em>inter-legere</em>,<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> "to read
between"&mdash;a phrase which clearly
implies two definite terms, between
which a definite relation is apprehended.
Accordingly, nothing is
intelligible, except inasmuch as it
implies two correlatives; and, therefore,
since every essence is intelligible,
every essence implies two
principles conspiring through mutual
relativity into an intelligible
ratio. These two principles of a
primitive essence are themselves
intelligible only as correlated; for
the constituents of a <em>primitive</em> essence
are not other essences, as is
evident; and therefore cannot have
a separate and independent intelligibility.
They are therefore absolutely
simple and unanalyzable, and
of such a relative character that
they cannot exist, or even be conceived,
separated from one another.
The same is true of existence also,
which has no separate intelligibility,
as it is utterly simple and unanalyzable,
and cannot be conceived or
affirmed, except with reference to
the essence to which it may belong.
It follows, then, that every primitive
being can be resolved into three
simple principles, of which two
constitute its real essence, whilst
the third&mdash;viz., existence&mdash;completes
the same essence into real
being. Such is our first proof.</p>

<p>A little reflection will now suffice
to determine the general nature of
the two essential principles just
mentioned, and to obtain at the
same time a second proof of our
proposition. Existence is the actuality
of essence. Now, actuality
can spring only from actuation;
and actuation necessarily implies an
<em>act</em>, which actuates, and a <em>term</em>,
which is actuated. Therefore the
two constituents of any primitive
essence must be a real act whose
intrinsic character is to actuate its
term, and a real term whose intrinsic
character is to be actuated by
its act; whilst the actuality of the
essence follows as a simple result
from the mutual conspiration of
these essential principles. Accordingly,
every primitive being involves
in its constitution three principles&mdash;viz.,
an <em>act</em>, its <em>term</em>, and the <em>actuality</em>
of the one in the other. This
last is called the <em>complement</em> of the
essence.</p>

<p>Readers accustomed to intellectual
speculations will need no additional
evidence to be satisfied of
the cogency of the two preceding
proofs. But those who are less
familiar with philosophy may yet
want some tangible illustration of
our reasonings before they fully
realize the nature of the three principles
and of their relations. We
hope the following will do. Physicists
show that if a material point
moves for a time, <em>t</em>, with a uniform
velocity, <em>v</em>, through a space, <em>s</em>, the
relation of the three quantities will
be expressed by the equation&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="overunder"><span class="bb"><em>s</em></span><em>v</em></span> = <em>t</em>
</p>

<p>It is plain that the three quantities,
<em>s</em>, <em>v</em>, <em>t</em>, are the three intrinsic
principles of movement. In fact,
the velocity, <em>v</em>, is the <em>act</em>, or the
form, of movement; whence the
epithet of <em>uniform</em> applied to all
movement of constant velocity; the
amount, <em>s</em>, of space measured is the
<em>term</em> actuated by the said velocity;
the time, <em>t</em>, is the duration of the
movement, that is, its <em>actuality</em>;
for as movement is essentially successive,
its actuality also is successive,
and constitutes a length of
time. Here, then, we have most
distinctly the three principles of
movement. Let us remark that the
first member of the equation is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_826" id="Page_826">[Pg 826]</a></span>
<em>ratio</em> of the term to its act, and
therefore represents the essence of
movement; whilst the second member
exhibits the duration of its existence.
The sign of equality between
the two members does not
mean that the essence of movement
is the same thing as the existence
of movement, but only that both
have the same <em>quantitative value</em>.
For it should be remarked that, although
a ratio is usually defined as
"the quotient of a quantity divided
by another of the same kind,"
nevertheless the quotient is not exactly
the ratio, but its result or
value; and is not the equivalent of
the ratio in quality, but in quantity
only. In pure mathematics,
which are exclusively concerned
with quantities, the distinction between
the ratio and its value may
not be important; but when a ratio
is viewed in its metaphysical aspect,
the distinction is of great consequence.
For a metaphysical ratio
is not looked upon as the ratio of
two quantities, of which the one
is the measure of the other, but as
the ratio of two realities, of which
the one actuates the other, and
which, though belonging to the
same kind of being, are, however, of
a relatively opposite character, as
is evident from the very example
we are considering. The space, <em>s</em>,
and the velocity, <em>v</em>, are, in fact, conceived
as quantities of the same
kind, only because velocity is mathematically
expressed in terms of the
space measured through it in a unit
of time; yet velocity is certainly
not space, but is that by which
matter is compelled to move
through space; so that while the
extent of the space measured in a
unit of time corresponds to the velocity
with which it is measured,
velocity itself has no extension, but
intensity only. Hence the ratio of
space to velocity, metaphysically
considered, is a ratio of extension
to intensity, or of potency to act,
as we shall presently explain.</p>

<p>The third proof of our proposition
is very simple. The intrinsic
principles of being must correspond
to its extrinsic principles, each to
each respectively. For were any
of the extrinsic principles not represented
in the principiated being
by something real proceeding from
it, and corresponding to it, such an
extrinsic principle evidently would
principiate nothing, and would be
no principle at all. Now, we have
seen that the extrinsic principles of
primitive being are three. It is
evident, therefore, that its intrinsic
principles likewise must be three.
The extrinsic principles, as before
stated, are God's volition of bringing
something into existence, the
term of its eduction, and the creative
power exerted in its production.
Hence it follows that every
thing created must contain within
itself an <em>act</em> as the product of the
Creator's action, a <em>term</em> as an expression
of the term of its eduction,
and an <em>actuality</em> as the accomplishment
and fulfilment of the volition
of bringing it into existence.</p>

<p>We may here remark that the
<em>act</em> of the created being is produced
<em>by</em> God as its efficient <em>cause</em>, proceeds
<em>from</em> God's omnipotence as
its efficient <em>principle</em>, and is produced
<em>through</em> action as the proximate
<em>reason</em> of its causation and principiation.</p>

<p>The <em>term</em> of the created being,
on the contrary, comes <em>out of</em> mere
nothingness, acquires its reality
<em>through</em> the mere position of an act,
is not made, but actuated, and
therefore has no efficient cause,
but only a formal principle, the
reality of which is the sole reason
why the term is called real, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_827" id="Page_827">[Pg 827]</a></span>
disappearance of which would leave
nothing behind. As a spherical
form, by the necessity of its own
nature, gives existence to a geometric
centre, without need of an efficient
cause, so does the essential act
to its essential term. Let the spherical
form be annihilated, and the
centre will be gone; let the essential
act vanish, and the essential
term will have vanished together
with it.</p>

<p>Finally, the <em>actuality</em> of the created
being proceeds from the act and
the term as making up its formal
source, or the <i lang="la">principium formale
quod</i>; while the formal reason, or
the <i lang="la">principium formale quo</i>, of its
proceeding is the actuation of the
latter by the former, and the completion
of the former in the latter;
for to actuate a term is to give it
actuality, and to be actuated is to
become actual; and therefore the
result of such an actuation is the
actuality of the act in its term, and
of the term in its act, or the complete
actuality of the created essence
and of the created being.</p>

<p>Thus the whole being, by its act,
its term, and its complement, points
out adequately and with the utmost
distinction the three extrinsic principles
whence it proceeds.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>The fourth proof is as follows:
Every created being possesses an
intrinsic natural activity and an
intrinsic natural passivity. It possesses
activity; for every creature
must have an intrinsic natural aptitude
to reveal, in one way or another,
the perfections of its Creator,
as such is the end of all creation;
but to reveal is to act; and, therefore,
every creature possesses its
intrinsic aptitude and determination
to act&mdash;that is, <em>activity</em>. It also
possesses passivity; for all contingent
beings are changeable, and
therefore capable of receiving new
intrinsic determinations; and such
an intrinsic capability is what we
call <em>passivity</em>, or <em>potentiality</em>. The
consequence is, that every creature
possesses something by reason of
which it is active, and something
on account of which it is passive;
which amounts to saying that
every creature possesses its intrinsic
principle of activity, or, as it is
styled, its <em>act</em>, and its intrinsic
principle of passivity, or, as we call
it, its <em>potency</em> or its <em>potential term</em>.
Hence the well-known fundamental
axioms of metaphysics: "Every
agent acts by reason of its act,"
and "Every patient suffers on account
of its potency."<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> Now, since
the same being that can act can
also be acted on, it is evident that
that by reason of which it can act,
and that on account of which it can
be acted on, are the principles of
one and the same actual essence,
and therefore conspire into one
formal actuality, which completes
the essence into being. Accordingly,
in all creatures, or primitive
complete beings, we must admit
<em>act</em> and <em>potency</em> as the constituents,
and <em>actuality</em> as the formal complement,
of their essence.</p>

<p>These four proofs more than
suffice to show that all primitive
complete beings consist of <em>act</em>,
<em>term</em>, and <em>complement</em> as their intrinsic
principles. But, as I am satisfied
that on the right understanding
of such principles the soundness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_828" id="Page_828">[Pg 828]</a></span>
of all our metaphysical reasonings
finally depends, I think it necessary,
before we proceed further, to make
a few considerations on their exact
notion, character, and attributions.</p>

<p>The <em>term</em> of a primitive being
owes its reality to its act. Before
its first actuation, it had no being
at all; it was only capable of acquiring
it, and therefore was, according
to the language of the
schools, a reality <em>in mere potency</em>;
since everything that has no being,
but can be actuated into being, has
received the name of <em>pure potency</em>.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>
Now, pure potency, though it is nothing
real, is infinite and inexhaustible;
not that nothingness can have
any such <em>intrinsic</em> attribute, but
simply because no limit can be assigned
to the possible eduction of
beings out of nothing through the
exercise of God's infinite and inexhaustible
power. And it must be
added that such a potency is thus
infinite not only with regard to the
substances that can be created out
of nothing, but also with regard to
the accidents which can be produced
in those substances, and with
regard to the modes resulting from
the reception of such accidents.
This being admitted, it is evident
that, when the term of a created
being acquires its first reality, a
pure potency is actuated by an act;
but is not actuated to the full
amount of its actuality, which is
infinite and inexhaustible. Indeed,
no act gives to its potency the
plenitude of all being; but every
act gives that being only which
corresponds to its own specific nature.
And therefore the term of a
primitive being, though actuated in
its first actuation as much as is
needed to make it the real term of
a determinate essence, remains always
capable of further and further
actuation; in other words, such a
term is still, and always will be,
entirely <em>potential</em> in regard to all
other acts compatible with the nature
of the first by which it is actuated.</p>

<p>Hence we come to the conclusion
that every created being, for the very
reason of its having been educed
out of nothing, retains potency, as
the stamp of its origin, in its essential
constitution. <em>All creatures</em>, then,
<em>are essentially potential</em>, and therefore
imperfect; as potency means perfectibility.
<em>God alone is free from potency</em>,
as he is the only being that
did not come out of nothing.</p>

<p>A second conclusion is that the
essential term of a created being
may be considered under two aspects&mdash;viz.,
as to the <em>reality</em> it borrows
from its act, and as to the
<em>potentiality</em> it inherits from its previous
nothingness. Hence such a
term must be called a <em>real potency</em>;
the word <em>real</em> expressing the fact of
its actuation, and the word <em>potency</em>
expressing its ulterior actuability.
Reality and potentiality constitute
<em>passivity</em>.</p>

<p>It is not unusual to confound
substance with the term actuated
by a substantial act. Of course, the
term cannot be thus actuated without
the substance becoming actual;
but, though this is true as a matter
of fact, it does not follow that substance
can be confounded with its
intrinsic term. Sphericity actuates
a centre; and yet the centre thus
actuated is not a sphere, but only
the intrinsic term of sphericity.
In like manner the act actuates its
potency; but this potency is not
the substance itself; it is only one
of its constituents.</p>

<p>The potential term, such as it is
found in material substance, is called
<em>the matter</em>. Hence all that plays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_829" id="Page_829">[Pg 829]</a></span>
the part of potency in any being
whatever is called its <em>material</em> constituent,
although such a being may
not contain matter properly so called.
Thus we say, for instance,
that the genus is the <em>material</em> part
of an essential definition, because
the genus is potential respecting
some specific difference, by which
it may be further determined. In
such cases the word <em>material</em> stands
for "that which receives any determination,"
whether it receives it
in fact or in thought only. In
English, the words <em>material</em> and <em>immaterial</em>
are sometimes used in the
sense of important and unimportant.
This meaning may be perfectly
justifiable, but is not adopted
in philosophy.</p>

<p>With regard to the <em>act</em> by which
the essential term of a being is first
actuated, it is necessary fully to
realize the fact that this act is neither
God's creative power nor
God's creative action, but something
quite different. It is true
that all actions are measured or
valued by their effects, that is, by
the acts in which they end; thus
we measure the amount of motive action
by the quantity of movement<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>
produced. Nevertheless, it is quite
evident that the production of
a thing, and the thing produced,
cannot be confounded with one another.
And, since action is nothing
but the production of an act,
the action and the act produced
cannot be confounded with one another,
even though they are represented
by one and the same word.
Thus the action of a painter is not
the painting (substantive), although
such an action is also called "painting"
(participle). Again, the momentum
of a falling drop of rain is
not the action of the earth, although
it is directly from it. And in the
same manner the act produced by
the Creator is not his creative action,
though it is directly from it.
Still less can we confound the act
produced with the power by which
it is produced; for though every
effect is virtually contained in its
efficient power, we know that it is
not contained formally; otherwise
the painting should pre-exist within
the painter, and the momentum of
the falling drop within the earth.
As, then, the momentum of the
falling drop has no formal existence
in the earth, but only in the
drop itself while it is falling, so
also the act which proceeds from
God has no formal existence in
God, but only in the term actuated.
To say that a created act is God's
creative action or creative power,
is no less a blunder than to say
that a circle described on a blackboard
is the power or the action of
describing it.</p>

<p>The act which actuates its essential
term, in the case of material
substance, is called <em>the form</em>. Hence
all that plays the part of an act in
any being whatever is called its
<em>formal</em> constituent. Thus we say
that the specific difference is the
<em>formal</em> part of the essential defini<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_830" id="Page_830">[Pg 830]</a></span>tion,
because the difference is conceived
as actuating the genus into
species. In such cases the word
<em>formal</em> stands for "that which gives
any determination," whether it gives
it in fact or in thought only.</p>

<p>Finally, the <em>actuality</em> of the created
being corresponds, as we have
already explained in the preceding
article, to the finality of creation, inasmuch
as it perfects the essence
into being. This actuality has received
different names, according
to the different light in which it can
be viewed and the different connotations
of which it affords the
ground. It is called the <em>complement</em>
of the essence, its <em>formal existence</em>,
its <em>formal unity</em>, its <em>individuality</em>.
It is called "complement" of the
essence, inasmuch as it satisfies all
its requirements, and completes it
into actual being; its "formal existence,"
inasmuch as it is the formal
result of active and passive actuation;
its "formal unity," inasmuch
as it arises from two principles
conspiring into unity of essence,
and therefore of existence
also; its "individuality," inasmuch
as it is the unity of a <em>concrete</em> being;
for individuality is nothing but
"that on account of which a thing is
formally <em>one</em> in its concrete being."</p>

<p>Some philosophers of the Scotistic
school hold that "individuality"
and "formal unity" are different
things. They say that formal
unity is not individual, but universal;
because it does not include in
its conception the individuative
notes. They accordingly teach that
the universal is to be found to exist
<em>formally</em> in the individual; whence
they have been surnamed <em>Formalists</em>,
or <em>Ultra-realists</em>.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> But it is not
true that the formal unity does not
include in itself the individuative
notes. In fact, all existing essence
contains in its own principles the
adequate reason of its individuation,
and therefore it cannot, by the real
conspiration of its principles, be
formally <em>one</em> without being <em>individual</em>
also. Accordingly, formal unity,
though universal in our conception,
is individual in the thing itself.</p>

<p>It is evident that the actuality resulting
from the act <em>giving</em>, and the
term <em>receiving</em>, existence, exhibits
itself as existence <em>given</em> and <em>received</em>&mdash;that
is, as <em>complete</em> real existence.
On the other hand, all real result
has a real opposition to the formal
principles of its resultation; for all
that really proceeds has a real relative
opposition to that from which
it proceeds. A real relative opposition
is therefore to be admitted
between the real essence and its
formal existence; and consequently
essence and existence must be considered
as really distinct. Not that
the essence of a real being does not
imply its existence; but because in
the essential act and the essential
term existence is contained only
radically or virtually, not formally,
in the same manner as the conclusion
is virtually contained in the
premises from which it follows, or
as equality is contained in the quantities
from whose adequation it results.
Hence, as in the logical order
the formal conclusion is distinct
from the premises in which it is virtually
implied, so also in the real
order is the formal existence of any
being to be distinguished from the
real principles of the essence in
which it is virtually implied. As,
however, the act and the term, notwithstanding
their real relative opposition
and distinction, identify
themselves really, though inadequately,
with the <em>essence</em> of the
actual being, so also the actuality
of the being, though having a real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_831" id="Page_831">[Pg 831]</a></span>
relative opposition to the act and
the term from which it results, identifies
itself really, yet inadequately,
with the complete <em>being</em> of which it
is the actuality.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> Whence we conclude
that every primitive being,
though strictly one in its physical
entity, consists of three metaphysical
constituents <em>really</em> distinct from
one another on account of their
real relative opposition.</p>

<p>We must here notice that the last
of these three constituents&mdash;actuality&mdash;is
scarcely ever mentioned by
the scholastic philosophers. They,
in fact, consider all natural beings
as constituted of <em>act</em> and <em>potency</em>
only. It may have appeared to
them that by simply stating the fact
of the concurrence of act and potency
into one actual essence, the
fact of the unity and actuality of
that essence would be sufficiently
pointed out. They may have had
another reason also for omitting the
mention of our third principle; for
in speculative questions it is the
essence of things, and not their existence,
that comes under consideration;
and essence, as such, involves
two principles only&mdash;viz.,
the <em>act</em> and the <em>term</em>, as we have
stated above. It is obvious, then,
that in their analysis of the "quiddity"
of beings, they had no need
of mentioning our third principle.
A third reason may have been that
the act and the potency, or the
form and the matter, in the opinion
of those philosophers, were two
things separable, as the Aristotelic
theory of substantial generations
implied; whereas the actuality of
the being was not considered as a
third thing separable from either
the form or the matter, and therefore
was not thought worthy of a
separate mention.</p>

<p>But, the reality of this third
principle being universally admitted,
there can be no doubt about
the convenience, and even the necessity,
of giving it a distinct and
prominent place in the constitution
of any complete being. This has
been already shown in the preceding
pages; but, for the benefit of
those who have never paid special
attention to the subject, we will
give a summary of the principal
reasons why in metaphysical treatises
the actuality of being should be
methodically granted as distinct a
place among the intrinsic principles
of things as is allotted to the
essential act and its term.</p>

<p>First, then, all being that has
existence in nature is something
complete, not only <em>materially</em>&mdash;that
is, by having its term&mdash;but also
<em>formally</em>, by having its own complete
constitution or actuality.
The difference between material
and formal completion will be
easily understood by an example.
The sculptor carves the marble
and makes a statue. The marble
is the <em>material</em> term, and the figure
resulting in the marble is the
<em>formal</em> term, of his work. Hence
the work of carving is <em>materially</em>
complete in the marble and <em>formally</em>
complete in the figure,<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> which is
the actuality of the statue as such.
And it is evident that, in speaking
of a statue, such a figure is as
worth mentioning as the marble
and the carving. And therefore,
as in the analysis of being we give
a prominent place to the term
which completes the act, we should
do the same with regard to the actuality,
which completes the essence.
A writer in the <cite>Dublin Review</cite>, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_832" id="Page_832">[Pg 832]</a></span>has cleverly treated this subject,
makes the following remark: "The
constituents <i lang="fr">actus</i> and <em>terminus</em>, or
<em>forma</em> and <i lang="la">materia</i>, are recognized
in the schools. The third constituent
is not expressly mentioned
there. But you hear of <em>essentia</em>
and <em>esse</em>; and <em>esse</em> is the <i lang="la">complementum</i>.
I have a fancy that the
much-canvassed distinction between
the ἐνέργεια and the ἐντελέχεια
of Aristotle is really this,
that ἐνέργεια is the <i lang="fr">actus</i>, and
ἐντελέχεια the <i lang="la">complementum</i>."<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>
This remark is very judicious; for
it is as certain that the complete
being consists of essence and existence
as it is certain that the essence
consists of act and term;
and, moreover, there is no less a distinction
between the essence and
its existence than between the act
and its term. Hence the same
reasons that led metaphysicians to
give a conspicuous place to the act
and its term in the analysis of the
essence, show that a similar place
should also be given to essence and
its actuality in the analysis of the
being.</p>

<p>In the second place, the formal
complement of being is the only
ground on which many different
and opposite things can be predicated
of one and the same being;
as, for instance, activity and passivity,
action and passion, to be, to
be one, to be good, etc. It is,
therefore, important not to leave in
the shade that principle, without
which no unity of being can be
conceived.</p>

<p>Thirdly, an explicit knowledge
and mention of such a complement
is indispensable, in a great number
of cases, when we have to explain
how accidental modes <em>not received</em>
in a substance can <em>intrinsically</em> belong
to that substance&mdash;a thing
which will never be radically explained
without an explicit reference
to the formal complement of
the being in which those modes are
to be found.</p>

<p>Fourthly, in the intellectual as
well as in the sensitive nature the appetitive
faculty cannot be accounted
for, nor distinguished from the
cognoscitive, unless we have recourse
to this same formal complement,
which constitutes the <em>affectibility</em>
of the same natures&mdash;a truth
which we must here simply state,
as its demonstration belongs to
special metaphysics.</p>

<p>Fifthly, it is unwise to expose
the reader to the danger of confounding
things having a metaphysical
opposition to one another; for
instance, the uniting with the union
accomplished, the constituting with
the complete constitution, the actuation
with the actuality. But if
the actuality is kept out of view
when we give the principles of beings,
such confusion will be almost
unavoidable. I believe that it is
owing to the omission of this third
principle that even great philosophers
have not unfrequently mistaken
attitudes for acts, and actualities
for forms.</p>

<p>Sixthly, after we have analyzed
a primitive complete being, and
found it to consist of three intrinsic
principles, it is nothing but reasonable
to keep them all equally in
sight, and to make them all serve
in their turn for the simplification
of metaphysical investigations; especially
as the distinct recollection
of the act, of its term, and of the
actuality of both will also draw the
student's attention to the corresponding
extrinsic principles&mdash;viz.,
to the creative power from which
that act proceeds, to the nothingness
out of which that term was
educed, and to the last end for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_833" id="Page_833">[Pg 833]</a></span>
which that actuality obtained a
place in the real order of things.</p>

<p>Lastly, by the consideration that
these <em>three</em> intrinsic and relatively
opposite principles constitute <em>one</em>
primitive complete being, it becomes
possible to account philosophically
for the known fact that
every creature bears in itself, <i lang="la">in
vestigio</i> at least, as S. Thomas puts
it, a more or less imperfect image
of God's unity and trinity&mdash;a topic
on which much might be said, were
this the place for discussing the
analogy between beings of different
orders.</p>

<p><em>A few corollaries.</em> From the
resolution of complete beings into
their intrinsic principles, and from
the different character of these
principles and of their principiation,
a number of useful corollaries
can be drawn, among which the
following deserve a special attention:</p>

<p>1. It is a great mistake, and one
which leads straight to pantheism,
to assert, as Gioberti did, that creatures
are not <em>beings</em>, but only <em>existences</em>.
For if creatures have their
own actual essence, they are not
<em>mere</em> existences, but complete beings;
and, if they have no essence,
they cannot exist; as all existence
is the actuality of some essence.
Hence to assert that creatures are
not beings, but only existences,
amounts to saying that creatures
have no essence, and that their existence
is the existence of nothing&mdash;that
is, <em>non-existence</em>. Moreover,
mere existence is a simple actuality,
and does not exhibit an intelligible
ratio; hence, if creatures
were mere existences, they would
be intrinsically unintelligible, not
only to us, as Gioberti pretends,
but to God himself, who certainly
does not understand what is intrinsically
unintelligible. There is no
need of insisting on such an unavoidable
conclusion.</p>

<p>That the same assertion leads
straight to pantheism is likewise
evident. In fact, the absurdity of
admitting existences which would
be existences of nothing could not
be escaped but by trying to pin
them on the substance of God himself,
and by saying, with the pantheist,
that all such existences are
nothing but divers actualities, or attitudes,
or forms assumed by the
divine substance. Thus, to escape
one absurdity, we would fall into
another.</p>

<p>2. Inasmuch as the actuality of
a given essence makes a given
thing formally complete, one, and
perfect according to its entitative
degree, it is to such an actuality
that everything owes that it is formally
good, and that it answers to
the finality of its creation. Such a
goodness implies two things: the
first, that every creature is good in
its <em>absolute</em> being, for it is in such
a being that God's design is fulfilled
of communicating his goodness
outside of himself; the other,
that every creature is good in its
<em>relative</em> being also&mdash;that is, in its intrinsic
aptitude and determination
to manifest God's perfections in a
manner and degree proportionate
to the kind and degree of its entity.
Accordingly, every created being
is good not only as it is a <em>thing</em>,
but also as it is <em>a principle of action</em>.
In the first capacity it fulfils the
immediate end of its creation, and
in the second it fulfils by its action
the ultimate end for the sake of
which it has been made to exist.</p>

<p>3. Hence we further infer, that
the essence of every created being
is its <em>nature</em> also. For <em>nature is a
principle of motion</em>, according to
Aristotle, whether motion is taken
as the action proceeding from that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_834" id="Page_834">[Pg 834]</a></span>
nature itself, or as the reception of
an action proceeding from an extrinsic
agent. Now, we have seen
that all creatures are manifestative
of God's perfections, and therefore
that they have in themselves an act
which is a principle of action; on
the other hand, we have also seen
that every creature has its potential
term, and therefore passivity, or
receptivity of new determinations.
Accordingly, every created being,
by the very nature of its essential
constituents, is a complete principle
of motion. Essence and nature
are, therefore, the same thing in
reality, though they are distinguished
from one another in our conception.
S. Thomas considers that
these three words, <em>nature</em>, <em>essence</em>,
and <em>quiddity</em>, apply to one and the
same thing viewed under three distinct
aspects; the word <em>nature</em>
meaning the essence of the thing as
connoting operation, since there is
no natural being without active
power; whereas the word <em>quiddity</em>
means the same essence viewed as
an object of definition; and the
word <em>essence</em> is used to express the
fact that in it and through it a
thing has its own being.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> Whence
it follows that a complete being is
no sooner endowed with existence
than with activity, and is no sooner
a being than an individual nature.
And therefore a complete being
and a concrete nature are really
one and the same thing. Malebranche's
theory, denying that creatures
have any true causality, is
therefore utterly untenable, as it
cannot be reconciled with the first
principles of metaphysics.</p>

<p>4. The entity of the active power
contained in the nature of any
being cannot be anything else than
its essential act; that is, the very
act produced by God in its creation.
In fact, we have just seen
that in all creatures the essence and
the nature are the same reality, and
that the constituents of the nature
are nothing but the constituents of
the essence. Accordingly, the nature
of every creature consists of
an essential act and an essential
term; the one being its principle
of activity, as the other is its
principle of passivity. "The form,"
says S. Thomas, "is that by which
the agent acts," and "By what a
thing is, by that it acts," and "The
principle of being is the principle
of acting," and "Every agent acts
inasmuch as it is in act." These
axioms are accepted by all real
philosophers. Hence the active
principle of any complete being,
and its essential act, are the same
thing in reality, though they are
distinguished from one another in
our conception, in the same manner
as are nature and essence; for the
<em>essential act</em> connotes the intrinsic
term of the essence, to which the
act is essentially terminated, whilst
the <em>active principle</em> connotes any extrinsic
term to which the action
proceeding from the same act is, or
can be, accidentally terminated.
This is what S. Thomas means
when he says that "a natural form
is a principle of operation, not inasmuch
as it is the permanent form
of the thing to which it gives existence,
but inasmuch as it has a leaning
towards an effect."<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> Such a
<em>leaning</em> (<em>inclinatio</em>) should be taken
to mean a natural <em>ordination</em> or <em>determination</em>
to act.</p>

<p>Philosophers agitate the question,
whether created substances act by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_835" id="Page_835">[Pg 835]</a></span>
themselves immediately, or by the
aid of accidents. The Scotistic
school holds the first opinion, whilst
the Thomistic supports the second.
For reasons which it would take too
long to develop in this place, we
are inclined to believe that natural
accidents are not active, and that
their bearing on the action of substance
is not of an efficient, but of
a formal, character; by which we
mean that accidents have no play
in the production of effects, except
inasmuch as their presence or absence
entails a different formal determination
of the conditions in
which the agent is to exert its power.
It is true, indeed, that created
substances never act independently
of accidental conditions; but it is
true, at the same time, that they always
act by themselves without the
aid of accidents, inasmuch as the
active power they exert is so exclusively
owned by them that it
cannot even partially reside in any
of their accidents.</p>

<p>As the active principle is really
nothing else than the act by which
the agent is, so also the passive
principle is really nothing else than
the essential term by which that
act is completed. Here again the
same reality presents itself under
two distinct aspects; for the phrase
<em>essential term</em> connotes the essential
act by which the term is essentially
actuated, whilst the phrase <em>passive
principle</em> connotes any accidental
act by which the same term is liable
to be accidentally actuated.</p>

<p>5. Since a being possessing its
three intrinsic principles is so fully
and adequately constituted as to
require nothing additional to exist,
it is obvious that such a being contains
in its perfect constitution the
sufficient reason of its aptitude to
exist <i lang="la">non in alio et non per aliud</i>, but
<i lang="la">in se et per se</i>; that is, in itself and
by itself. Now, to exist in itself is
to be a <em>substance</em>, and to exist by
itself is to be what philosophers
call <em>suppositum</em>&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, a thing having
separate subsistence; and, therefore,
such a being, if simply left to
itself, will be both a substance and
a suppositum. In fact, the essential
act of a created being, though
always needing positive conservation
on account of its contingency,
needs no termination to, or sustentation
from, a subject, as it already
holds under itself its own intrinsic
term, by which it is sufficiently terminated
and sustained. And in
the same manner, the essence of a
complete being needs no union
with any extraneous nature to be
made completely subsistent, as it is
already sufficiently complete on account
of its formal actuality and
individuality. Thus it is manifest
that <em>nothing positive is to be added</em> to
a complete being in order to make
it a substance and a suppositum; it
suffices to leave it alone without further
sustentation and without further
completion. By the first of these
two negations, the being will exist
<i lang="la">non in alio</i>, but in itself; and by
the second it will subsist <i lang="la">non per
aliud</i>, but by itself. Hence it is
that the first negation is called
<em>the mode of substance</em>, and the second
<em>the mode of the suppositum</em>.</p>

<p>6. To be, to be true, to be one,
to be good, to be a thing or a being,
are convertible expressions so far
as their real objective meaning is
concerned, and are distinct only on
account of their different connotations.
A thing is called <em>a being</em>, inasmuch
as it has existence. It is
called <em>true</em>, inasmuch as its act
suits its term, and <i lang="la">vice versa</i>. For
the objective truth of things&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>,
their metaphysical truth&mdash;is nothing
but their intelligibility; and the
whole intelligibility of a being con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_836" id="Page_836">[Pg 836]</a></span>sists
in the agreement of an essential
act with its essential term; that
is, in this: that the one adequately
satisfies the wants of the other, and
thus constitutes with it one perfect
intelligible ratio or essence. Hence
the termination of the proper act
to the proper term makes a thing
objectively true; just as the application
of the proper predicate to
the proper subject makes true a
proposition. This objective or
metaphysical truth is perfectly independent
of our knowledge of it;
it has, however, the reason of its
being in God's intellect, in which
the archetypes of all that is intelligible
are contained, and to which the
whole ideal order is to be traced as
to its original source. A thing is
called <em>one</em> on account of the formal
unity of its essence and of its existence.
It is called <em>good</em>, objectively
and metaphysically, inasmuch as
it is materially and formally complete
in the manner above described,
and consequently perfect, so as to require
no further intrinsic endowment
to exist.</p>

<p>The objective goodness of any
being arises from its truth; for it
is the mutual fitness of the essential
act and of the essential term
that accounts for their mutual
agreement in unity of existence;
whence it follows that the being
will naturally exist in itself, and
subsist by itself, without any further
addition, as though finding
rest in its own reality. But, that
in which anything finds rest is its
own good; and therefore everything
that exists in itself completely
is good to itself, while its act
and its term, as the intrinsic factors
of such a goodness, are good also,
but only of an initial and relative
goodness&mdash;viz., so far as the one
is good to the other. Lastly, the
word <em>thing</em> expresses the whole being
as it is in its concrete essence&mdash;that
is, the whole reality implied in
its three intrinsic principles. <em>Thing</em>
in Latin is <em>res</em>; and <em>res</em>, as well as
<em>ratio</em>, are connected with the verb
<i lang="la">reor</i> (to judge) in the same manner
as <em>pax</em> (peace) and <em>pactio</em> (compact)
are connected with the verb <em>paciscor</em>
(to make a compact); and accordingly,
as peace implies the
compact, of which it is the result,
and by which its conditions are
duly determined, so also <em>res</em> implies
the <em>ratio</em>, of which it is the
concrete result, and by which it is
confined between the bounds of a
determinate quiddity. Whether the
English words <em>thing</em>, <em>thought</em>, and
<em>to think</em> bear to one another the
same relation as the Latin <em>res</em>, <em>ratio</em>,
and <i lang="la">reor</i>, we are not ready to decide.</p>

<p>7. The verb <em>to be</em> has not exactly
the same meaning, when applied
to a complete being, as when
applied to its constituent principles.
Of the complete being we
say that <em>it is</em> simply and completely.
Of the essential act we also
say that <em>it is</em>, but not absolutely
nor completely, because it has no
existence apart from its term; existence
being the result of the position
of the one in the other. Of
the essential term we should not
say precisely that <em>it is</em>, but rather
that <em>it has being</em>. This adjective
predication is here employed, because
the being of the term is
wholly due to its act, without
which the term would be nothing,
as we have already shown; and
therefore the term <em>is not a being</em>, but
only <em>has the being</em> borrowed from
its act, just as the geometric centre
has no being but that which it receives
from the circumference. Of
the complement we do not say that
<em>it is</em>, or that <em>it exists</em>, because the
complement is the formal existence,
not of itself, but of the being of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_837" id="Page_837">[Pg 837]</a></span>
which it is the complement, and
therefore must be predicated of
the existent being, not of itself.
Thus we cannot correctly say that
<em>loquacity talks</em>, nor that <em>velocity runs</em>:
and for the same reason we should
not say that <em>existence exists</em>; for as
it is <em>the woman</em> that talks by her
loquacity, and <em>the horse</em> that runs
with its velocity, so it is <em>the complete
being</em> that exists by its own
existence.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the verb <em>to be</em>, when
used in a logical sense to express
the existence of an agreement between
a predicate and a subject,
or any other mental relation between
objects of thought, applies
equally to all things conceived,
whatever their degree of reality;
because, inasmuch as such things
are actually known, they are all
equally actual in our intellectual
faculty.</p>

<p>And now, with regard to the essence
itself of a complete being,
the question arises whether it
should be held <em>to be</em>, or to <em>have
being</em>, in the sense of the distinction
already made. S. Thomas
seems to hold that the essence of
creatures cannot be said <em>to be</em>, but
only <em>to have being</em>; for he teaches
that in creatures the essence is to
its existence as a potency is to an
act. If this doctrine were to be applied
to <em>possible</em> essences only, we
might admit it without discussion;
but the holy doctor seems to apply
it to the <em>actual</em> essence also;
for "<em>to be</em>," says he, "is the most
perfect of all realities, because it
performs the parts of an act with
regard to them all; as no thing has
actuality but according as it is;
and therefore <em>to be</em> is the actuality
of all things, even of the forms
themselves; and for this reason
existence is not compared to any
existing thing as a recipient to that
which is received, but rather as
that which is received to its recipient.
For when I mention the existence
of a man, or of a horse, or
of anything else, <em>existence</em> stands
for something formal and received,
and not for that to which it belongs."<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>It is clear, however, that the actuality
of anything is not an act
really received in the essence of the
thing as in a potency. For, according
to S. Thomas himself, nothing
is educed from potency into
act, except through an act which
is not originated by that potency;
and therefore <em>no potency contains in
itself the formal reason of its actuation</em>,
but all potency is actuated by
an act originated by an extrinsic
agent. Now, such is not the case
with <em>real</em> essences; for every <em>real</em>
essence contains in itself all that is
required to give rise to its actuality,
as we have proved; and consequently,
as soon as the essential act
actuates the essential term, the actuality
of the essence springs forth
by spontaneous resultation, as the
consequence from the premises,
with no need of an extrinsic agent
producing a new act. Granting,
then, that existence is something
<em>formal</em>, as S. Thomas truly says,
yet it does not follow that it is <em>an
act received</em>; it is only a <em>resulting
actuality</em>. And therefore the real essence
is not the potency of existence,
but its formal reason. Existence
is the complement of real essence,
and presupposes it; and
consequently gives it nothing but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_838" id="Page_838">[Pg 838]</a></span>
the real <em>denomination</em> of existent&mdash;and,
perhaps, this is all that S.
Thomas intended to teach, though
his words seem to imply a great
deal more. For, on the one hand,
he very often employs the word
<em>potentia</em>, not in the sense of passive
potency, but in that of virtuality;
and, on the other, he frequently
gives the name of forms to those
formalities from which things receive
their proper denomination,
and considers them as received in
the things to which they give such
a denomination. But in such cases
their reception is of course only
logical, not real, and accordingly
the thing denominated by them is
only a logical, not a real, potency, as
it already possesses the reality of
that by which it receives its special
denomination. Thus we say that
in man rationality is to animality as
act is to potency; but this is true
in a logical sense only, because
man's animality implies in its constitution
a rational soul, and therefore
is already in possession of rationality.</p>

<p>To conclude: the essence of all
actual beings is to be said <em>to be</em>
or <em>to exist</em> rather than <em>to have being</em>
or <em>to have existence</em>; and in the
same manner the essence of a possible
being is to be called a potency
<em>of existing</em> rather than <em>of receiving
existence</em>, so far, at least, as it is
considered in connection with its
intrinsic principles. The reader, if
not accustomed to metaphysical investigations,
will think that we, in
this last question, have only amused
ourselves with splitting hairs; to
correct such a judgment, he has
only to ask himself whether between
<em>being rich</em> and <em>holding borrowed
riches</em> the difference be important
or trivial.</p>

Motion corresponds to the Latin <i lang="la">motio</i>,
whilst movement corresponds to the Latin <i lang="la">motus</i>.
<em>Motio</em> means the motive action&mdash;that is, motion
properly&mdash;both as proceeding actively from

<i lang="la">motus</i>, on the contrary, signifies the result

between action and its result, we must
keep up a distinction between the words also.
Very probably movement and motion would
never have been accepted as synonymous, had
the verb <em>to move</em> exclusively retained its original
active signification; but, as people imagined
that movement was a kind of action, they
thought it right to say not only that the horse
moves the cart, but also that the cart <em>moves</em>, instead
of saying that it is moved. Even Newton
has been so misled by the popular use of this
verb as to write more than once <i lang="la">corpus movet</i>,
instead of <i lang="la">corpus movetur</i>. It was but natural
that "movement," too, should be transformed
into "motion." Are we too late to restore to these
two words their distinct meanings?</p></div>

<h3>THE JANSENIST SCHISM IN HOLLAND.<br />

JANSENISM IN THE CHURCH OF UTRECHT.</h3>

<p class="center">FROM LES ETUDES RELIGIEUSES. BY C. VAN AKEN.</p>


<p class="center">CONCLUDED.
</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p>Such was the system of Jansenius,
at least as to its main points;
its five famous propositions forming
the most important conclusions
of the system. If they are
not all to be found, <em>in so many
words</em>, in the <cite>Augustinus</cite>&mdash;which
neither pope nor theologian has
ever pretended they are&mdash;they are
the soul of the book, in the words
of Bossuet. This soul, this breath
of error, is revived in Quesnel and
in the false Synod of Pistoia. Now,
are the proofs called for of its existence
in the pretended church of
Utrecht? Then we have only to
let the hierarchy intruded in Holland
speak for itself through its
letter addressed to Scipio Ricci.
So far as I know, this letter has
never before been published. We
give it as faithfully transcribed
from the original in the archives at
Florence:<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>

"<span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>"We have just read with astonishment
a bull of Pope Pius VI., in which
the Synod of Pistoia, held by you in
1786, is condemned, and your episcopal
administration calumniated, upon
grounds which are incomprehensible.
Conduct such as this in regard to a
bishop and an ecclesiastical assembly of
the highest repute in the church, and the
spirit of partisanship which characterizes
the bull generally, have certainly not
been imitated from the great Doctor of
Grace, S. Augustine, whom the latter
seems intended to honor, since it is dated
on his feast.</p>

<p>"Your synod, monseigneur, was for
years, as the public well knew, under
examination by Roman censors; and it
is evident that they would not have occupied
themselves with it for so long a
time<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> if, instead of laboriously seeking
for pretexts to condemn it, they had
sought in it for that truth which is everywhere
displayed in it with clearness, dignity,
and unction. We need not, therefore,
have expected a confirmation of this
synod as the result of such an examination.
We are no longer in the days when
the popes used the authority of their see
only for edification, and not for destruction.
Your synod, monseigneur, reveals
nothing which is unworthy of the full
approbation of the head of the church,
and which would not have been cordially
received by the popes of former times.
But God permits that those of later
times should be swayed by prejudices
and by the dominating influence of a
court which, although foreign and even
contrary to the divine institution of the
Holy See, pretends, nevertheless, to
identify itself with the chair of S. Peter,
and has consequently taken upon itself
to dictate the bulls of the popes conformably
to its own interests&mdash;interests
often greatly opposed to those of the
church and of the Holy See.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> It finds
that these human interests have not been
made much of by the Synod of Pistoia,
which kept in view only the good of
souls and the disinterested exercise of
the functions of the pastorate. It could
not, therefore, approve this synod, since
its decrees preach the new covenant, of
which we are ministers, in the spirit and
not in the letter. The ancient one, in which
the spirit was sacrificed to the letter, and
in which God was honored by the lips,
while the heart was far from him, is
the only one in accord with the political
maxims and views of a court entirely
devoted to the <i lang="fr">éclat</i> of the pontifical
throne, and to the externals of
religion. The fathers of the synod,
most reasonably convinced that the true
and only object of the ministry established
by Jesus Christ is to give to God
adorers in spirit and truth, have endeavored,
so far as these evil times permitted,
to bring back Christian worship to
its primitive purity and simplicity. But
this could not be suffered by a court
which applies itself exclusively to fostering
abuses in ecclesiastical discipline
and in the administration of the sacraments,
and to all the new devotions and
superstitions<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> which give a false idea of
Christian piety, and cause the faithful to
forget the true spirit of Christianity; not
reforming, as it ought, this Judaical worship,
but making its profit of it, and taking
it under its protection, on all occasions.</p>

<p>"In the synod you held, monseigneur,
there were useful reforms proposed, and
even commenced. Still greater ones
were desired. If the wise regulations
made in it were put in practice and
everywhere adopted, as they deserve to
be; if its wishes were attended to, true
piety would flourish again, the church
would possess good ministers, their labors
would produce abundant fruits, the observance
of the canons would restore the
salutary discipline of the early days, the
hierarchical order would enjoy all its
rights, its head, the Holy See, would be
listened to and respected, but the Roman
court would become nothing. It is
this, monseigneur, which excites its resentment
against you and your synod.
It is the court alone which has produced
this extraordinary bull, which is an injury
to the chair of S. Peter, more even
than to the Synod of Pistoia, and the
Pope has been dishonored by causing
him to adopt it.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_840" id="Page_840">[Pg 840]</a></span>
<p>"It was already sufficiently a scandal
that Rome alone gave no sign of approving
this synod, while it was receiving
praises everywhere else; that she alone
seemed to take no interest in the good
results of which it was susceptible, and
appeared even aggrieved and offended at
that which gave joy to all true children
of the church.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> But this was not enough
for the jealous and vindictive policy of
the Roman court. It wished to brand, by
a public and solemn censure, the acts of
the Synod of Pistoia; and although it
must have been infinitely painful to the
censors to find no matter for condemnation,
yet, by condemning, at whatever detriment
to itself, that which all the world
approved, it has capped the climax of
scandal&mdash;<i lang="la">scandali mensuram implevit</i>.</p>

<p>"Injustice vainly attempts a disguise:
it often betrays itself by the clumsy precautions
it takes to disguise itself. This,
monseigneur, is what we see in the bull
of August 28, in which God permitted
that its compilers should, against all prudence,
depart from their ordinary method
of making qualifications <i lang="la">in globo</i>, so convenient,
and even so necessary, where
there is question of condemning good
books. By applying to each of the propositions
censured by them particular
qualifications, they have thought to give
to their censure an appearance of greater
rectitude and equity, and by this very
means they have rendered evident to all
the spirit of deception and bad faith
which characterizes them. In fact, monseigneur,
if the use of this kind of censure
be even just and equitable in itself,
it would be impossible to abuse it more
grossly than they have done in the matter
of your synod. Every one knows
that, when propositions are bad and condemnable,
they are so in themselves and
in the sense they express. It is, then,
in themselves and in reference to this
sense that they should be condemned.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
This, however, is not what has been done
in regard to the greater number of the
propositions drawn from the Synod of
Pistoia. They are not condemned in
themselves nor in their proper sense, but
relatively to the imaginary sense attributed
to them. The truths they express
are passed over, in order to condemn the
errors they do not express; and while it
would be against all evidence to attribute
to them an erroneous sense, to which the
words are repugnant, they are nevertheless
condemned conditionally&mdash;that is to
say, by virtue of a gratuitous and often
absurd supposition that this erroneous
or in some wise reprehensible sense
may be conveyed therein. They dare
not condemn Jesus Christ, or, what is the
same thing, the truth in its own name; but
they give him the name and the dress of
Barabbas, in order to have the right of
sending him to punishment as a malefactor&mdash;<i lang="la">Et
cum iniquis reputatus est</i>.</p>

<p>"We have just said, monseigneur,
that the bull violated grossly in your regard
good faith and justice by this indirect
and captious manner in which it
condemns the greater number of the propositions
drawn from your synod. But
there are others, in the censure of which
the interests of the faith and of the teachings
of the church are equally disregarded.
They do not hesitate to sacrifice these
to the pernicious opinions of obnoxious
theological schools, the defence of which
is taken up against your decrees, under
the pretext that the Holy See tolerates
them under the name of Molinism&mdash;a
<em>Pelagian doctrine</em><a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> rejected by all tradition.
Thus error, or rather a number
of most dangerous errors, is put on a
level with truth; and the hand of Pius
VI. is made use of to replace beside the
ark that idol of Dagon so often over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_841" id="Page_841">[Pg 841]</a></span>turned
to its base by the censures of the
church and the writings of her doctors.
What idea have they, then, of the teachings
of the church, and of the rights of
bishops and their co-laborers in reference
to this doctrine? Because Paul V. did
not choose to do in regard to the doctrine
of Molina <em>that which his successors did in
regard to the doctrine of S. Augustine in
their bulls against Jansenius and Quesnel</em>;<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>
because they have not published, with
condemnation, the system of equilibrium,
of <i lang="la">gratia sufficiens</i>, of the state of pure
nature, of the <i lang="la">scientia media</i>, of limbo, etc.;
and have allowed to be taught the sufficiency
of attrition without the love of
God, and the ignorant devotion to the
Sacred Heart to be practised, shall pastors
no longer be permitted to oppose
to these novelties the principles and the
language of Scripture and tradition?
And shall they no longer warn the faithful
of the snares spread for their faith
and piety, because those who spread
them have not yet been declared heretics
by the Sovereign Pontiffs?</p>

<p>"They have not contented themselves,
monseigneur, with making a crime of
your private sentiments, however irreproachable,
but have quarrelled with you
for having, in your synod, adhered to a
doctrine so authoritative, so precious in
all churches and all states, as that contained
in the four articles of the assembly
of the clergy of France in 1682.
They have so poor an opinion of the
present clergy and of the Gallican
Church itself as to imagine that this
clergy would feel offended at the praises
you give to the celebrated declaration of
that assembly, and to take the insertion
you have made of it in the acts of
the Synod of Pistoia as an injury. But
if the synod does an injury to the French
clergy by adopting its maxims, what
does the Pope's bull do, which rejects
and condemns them?</p>

<p>"You may be sure, monseigneur, that
a bull like this&mdash;a censure as manifestly
unjust at bottom as singular and indecent
in form&mdash;is not likely to shake or
diminish in the least either our attachment
for you or our esteem and admiration
for the acts of your synod, <em>in the
doctrine of which our clergy recognize their
own</em>, through the chapter of Utrecht,
whose act of adhesion was sent to you
in November, 1789,<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> shortly after the
French publication of the synod. The
efforts which are now being made to cry
down its results, and to render them
abortive, are so much more a motive for
our confirming this adhesion, and of renewing
to you the expression of our interest
in your cause, afflicted, as we are,
to the bottom of our heart, that our Holy
Father, Pope Pius VI., who ought to show
us the example of like sentiments, shows
himself in his bull entirely opposed to
them. We sympathize with you, monseigneur,
no less in the personal offence
that has been offered you than in the
annoyances which cannot fail to arise to
you as well as to the faithful clergy of
your ancient diocese. But God, who has
enabled you long to foresee these things,
and who has already prepared you for
them by preliminary trials, will give you
grace to bear all this with continued
courage and confidence in his protection
and assistance.</p>

<p>"Considering the affair in itself, nothing
can be weaker than the attack that
has been made upon you by this bull,
which is more likely, in view of its
whole contents, to justify your doctrine
than to render it an object of suspicion.
But if we pay attention to the fact that it
is the very purity of this doctrine, and
your enlightened zeal for the house of
God, that have drawn upon you this unjust
treatment; that it is the testimony you
render fearlessly and without disguise to
the most important truths, so combated
in our days, of dogma, of morals, and of
discipline in the church, which renders
the Synod of Pistoia odious to the enemies
of these truths, nothing can be
grander nor more worthy of a bishop
than the cause you will have to defend.
Consequently, nothing can impel us
more to invoke upon you, monseigneur,
by our prayers, and upon all those whom
divine Providence will associate with
you in the same defence, the lights and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_842" id="Page_842">[Pg 842]</a></span>graces of the Holy Ghost. Ask them
also for us, who long preceded you in the
same career of tribulations and trials, and
whose cause has not been separated
from yours, since it has been attempted
to injure your synod by comparing it, in
the new bull, to our council&mdash;a comparison
most just and natural, and which
cannot but do honor to both.</p>

<p>"We are, with respect and tender attachment
in our Lord Jesus Christ, monseigneur,
your most humble and obedient
servants,</p>

<p>This letter renders evidence
against the clergy of Utrecht that
may justly be called crushing, and
would be sufficient in itself to close
the debate. It sheds light, also,
on the whole history of the schismatical
church of the United Provinces.
Now, to complete the
demonstration entered upon, let us
retrace our steps, and make research
into the origin and the peculiar
character of the Jansenism
of Holland.</p>


<h4>III.</h4>

<p>In the beginning of the XVIIth
century the University of Louvain
was in a most flourishing condition;
the purity of doctrine that prevailed
there, its attachment to the
Holy See, and the example of loyal
and perfect submission it had recently
given before the world by
repudiating the errors of Baius,
gained for it the respect and good
wishes of all Christendom. Some
of its professors, however, had not
entirely renounced Baianism; and
unhappily, in their case, distinguished
talents were joined with uncommon
activity. The most eminent
of these men was Jacques Janson,
who was the professor and, as it
were, the father of Jansenius. He
made the third of the party of
whom the future Bishop of Ypres
and the Abbé de Saint-Cyran were
the other two. Louvain then became
the centre of a set of ideas of
which the doctrines of Baius formed
the basis, and which were ripened
and developed by Jansenius
during nearly thirty years, to be
finally brought forth in his famous
<cite>Augustinus</cite>. It was also at the
school of Jacques Janson that Philip
Rovenius and several eminent
individuals among his clergy received
their theological training;
they therefore drank of Jansenism
at its very source.</p>

<p>The <cite>Augustinus</cite> was issued in
1640 from the press of Jacques
Zegers, of Louvain. Immediately,
Philip Rovenius, Archbishop of
Philippi, <i lang="la">in partibus infidelium</i>, and
Vicar Apostolic of the United
Provinces; Jean Wachtelaer, his
vicar-general; Baudoin Catz, afterwards
the successor of Jacques de
la Torre; Leonard Marius, professor
in the College Hollandais at
Cologne, and several besides, gave
a public and entire approval to the
book of Jansenius, coupled with
the most flattering praises. There
was at once in Belgium, as well as
in Holland, and on the part of
many virtuous and well-meaning
priests, an infatuation, an enthusiasm,
exhibited for the <cite>Augustinus</cite>,
of which the reception given almost
in our day to the first volume of
the <cite>Essai sur l'Indifference</cite> will
give only a faint idea. But Holland
distinguished herself in this
concert of praises; S. Augustine
himself, people said, had spoken
by the mouth of Jansenius; Jean
Wachtelaer averred that the Netherland
priests were never wearied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_843" id="Page_843">[Pg 843]</a></span>
with reading and meditating this
incomparable work; Rovenius went
further, and formed a league with
the Canon of Furnes, a nephew of
Jansenius, and several other partisans
of the new doctrines, to prevent
the Council of Brabant from
putting in execution the first measures
taken by the Holy See against
the <cite>Augustinus</cite>. These were the
circumstances that preceded the
bull <cite>In eminenti</cite>, published at Rome
on the 19th of June, 1643, in which
the famous work was proscribed as
containing propositions previously
condemned;<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> we are thus made
aware of the sentiments of the clergy,
and the spirit in which the
young Levites of the United Provinces
were formed. Rovenius submitted
to the pontifical definition;
in his book on the Christian Republic,<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>
printed at Anvers, in 1648, he
even renders solemn homage to the
infallibility of the Vicar of Christ.
This important doctrine was then,
as always, held in honor at the
University of Louvain. Rovenius
had learned it there, and to this
powerful preservative he owed the
honor and fidelity that attended his
last days.</p>

<p>The clergy of Holland seemed at
first to imitate the humble obedience
of its chief; but it soon became
evident that this submission
was neither as general nor as perfect
as was desirable. Left to its
ancient traditions of respect for the
Holy See, the Church of Holland
would perhaps have escaped shipwreck;
but it shortly received as
vicar apostolic a man of whom
Sainte-Beuve has truly said that
he was "the great auxiliary of Port
Royal in Holland."<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> Jean Neercassel,
priest of the Oratory, had
had a share in the government of
the mission since the year 1652.
Consecrated Bishop of Castoria, <i lang="la">in
partibus</i>, in 1662, he shortly after
became, by the death of Baudoin
Catz (1663), the sole vicar apostolic
in the United Provinces, and
continued so to be for the long
period of twenty-three years. The
illustrious Archbishop of Malines,
who knew, by a painful but glorious
experience, how greatly firmness
and devotion on the part of a chief
pastor were needed in those sad
times, said: "I shall always commiserate
those bishops who are
even on terms with a single one
of these innovators."<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> Neercassel
invited these innovators all to Holland,
and made it a place of refuge
for them. Arnauld, du Vaucel,
Gerberon, Quesnel, and a multitude
of apostate monks and fugitive
priests, all in revolt against
the decisions of the church, cast
themselves upon the poor mission
as upon a prey provided for them.
From Arnauld's correspondence,
and the papers found on Gerberon,
Quesnel, and others, we see that
the direction of the most important
affairs of the vicariate apostolic
then passed into the hands of
the patriarchs of Jansenism. In
this school, the clergy of the Netherlands
learned the wretched distinction
between <em>right</em> and <em>fact</em> (le
<em>droit</em> et le <em>fait</em>). As this distinction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_844" id="Page_844">[Pg 844]</a></span>tion forms one of the bases of the
resistance offered by that clergy to
the definitions of the Holy See, it
would be proper to give a brief explanation
of it.</p>

<p>The five famous propositions
having been referred to the tribunal
of the Sovereign Pontiff by
eighty-five French bishops, the so-called
disciples of S. Augustine sent
a deputation to Rome to defend
the sense of Jansenius. They prepared,
on this occasion, the celebrated
<i lang="fr">Ecrit à trois Colonnes</i>, in order,
said they, "to show fully the
state of the controversy, and to furnish
the Pope with the means of
knowing exactly upon what he had
to give judgment." For each proposition
there is distinguished, 1st,
the sense of Luther or of Calvin,
which is condemned; 2d, the natural
sense, <i lang="la">prout a nobis defenditur</i>, the
sense of Jansenius&mdash;in a word, that
said to be the sense of the church and
of S. Augustine;<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> 3d, and last, the
Pelagian or semi-Pelagian, which is
rejected like the first. At this time,
then, the party acknowledged, in
an official and authentic document,
that it defended the five propositions
in the sense of Jansenius, and
that this sense was the only natural
and legitimate one. The whole
question was to know if this sense
were heretical or not. It was upon
this point that the Pope's decision
was invoked both by the bishops
and by the partisans of Jansenius.</p>

<p>The decision was given the 31st
of May, 1653, in the bull <cite>Cum occasione</cite>,
which condemned the five
famous propositions. The church
evidently aimed a blow at the spirit
of the book, which alone conveyed
the error. The Jansenists understood
it as every one else did at
the time, and were confounded by
it. But in their farewell audience,
the deputies of the party asked the
Pope if he had been understood to
condemn the opinion in regard to
efficacious grace by itself&mdash;the doctrine
of S. Augustine. Certainly
not, replied the Holy Father. The
whole of Jansenism was embraced in
this equivocal question; for the Jansenists
reasoned thus: the <cite>Augustinus</cite>
contains nothing but the pure
doctrine of S. Augustine; we can
therefore submit to the bull without
rejecting the sense of Jansenius.</p>

<p>To prevent and eliminate in advance
every pretext for disobedience,
Pope Alexander VII., in 1665,
ordered, in a new bull, that the condemnation
of the five propositions
in the sense of Jansenius should be
subscribed to; he directed at the
same time, according to the ancient
usage of the church, that the
signature should be attached to a
formula in these words: "I,&mdash;&mdash;,
submit to the Apostolic Constitution
of Pope Innocent X., dated the
30th of May, 1653, and to that of
the Sovereign Pontiff Alexander
VII., dated the 16th of October,
1665; I condemn and reject heartily
and in all sincerity the five
propositions taken from the <cite>Augustinus</cite>
of Cornelius Jansenius in the
same manner as they are condemned
by the said constitutions; I
condemn them in the sense of that
author; thus I swear. May God
help me and this holy Gospel!"</p>

<p>Then it began to be said in the
camp of Jansenius: The pope and
the bishops may well decide if the
propositions are heretical; it is a
question of <em>right</em>. <i lang="fr">Créance au droit!</i>
But <em>are</em> the propositions taken from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_845" id="Page_845">[Pg 845]</a></span>
the <cite>Augustinus</cite>, and do they convey
its sense? That is a question
of <em>fact</em>, in regard to which the
church might be mistaken. Nevertheless,
<i lang="fr">respect au fait</i>! After
this, it was signed, excluding (<i lang="fr">en
exceptant</i>) the sense of Jansenius.
The more determined refused their
signature; after the time of Pierre
Codde, the successor of Neercassel,
this was the general rule.</p>

<p>No one, in my opinion, has more
fully set forth the state of this question
than the author of the <cite>Provincial
Letters</cite>, whose genius demonstrates
conclusively the absurdity
of this celebrated distinction.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> He
thus expresses himself in a passage
wherein he maintains his opinion
against Arnauld, Nicole, and others:
"The whole dispute is in ascertaining
if there be a fact and a
right disconnected from one another,
or if there be only a right;
that is, if the sense of Jansenius ... does
nothing but indicate the right.
The Pope and the bishops are on
one side, and they claim that it is a
point of right and of faith to say
that the five propositions are heretical
in the sense of Jansenius; and
Alexander VII. declares in his constitution
that, to be in the true
faith, we must say that the words,
'sense of Jansenius,' express only
the heretical sense of the propositions,
and that thus <em>it is a fact
which carries with it a right</em>, and
makes an essential part of the profession
of faith; as if we should
say: The sense of Calvin on the
Eucharist is heretical, <em>which is certainly
a point of faith</em>."<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>Nothing could be better said.
But what is the conclusion? It is
this, and Sainte-Beuve himself says
the same in other words:<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> the
church must be denied all infallibility
on the question of right; we
must allege that she can be mistaken
even as to the true and natural
sense of her own decrees, if we
would maintain that she could err
as to the fact in Jansenius. In a
word, we must either completely
break with the church, or condemn
the sense of Jansenius.</p>

<p>M. Réville seems to know very little
of the question of fact as regards
Jansenius. One might say
that, to form his opinion on this
point, he had consulted only a report
of the Jansenist Bishop of
Utrecht, which contains an account
of the latter's interview in 1828
with the Papal nuncio, Mgr. Capaccini.
In this, the representative
of the Holy See is made to use absurd
and ridiculous language; the
author of <cite>Port Royal</cite>, who was not
any too well versed in theology,
had a better knowledge of the
question than this nuncio. How
could M. Réville regard this as a
serious relation? Has a witness
who could neither understand the
Catholic theologians nor Pascal
himself the right to be believed
on his word when he reports, word
for word, a long conversation with
his opponent, a kind of diplomatic
passage-at-arms, wherein it was
greatly to his interest to make the
best figure for himself? And, besides,
what guarantee of exactitude
have we in a relation published for
the first time twenty-three years
after the interview, and six after
the death of Cardinal Capaccini,
the only person able to rectify the
assertions of his interlocutor?<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_846" id="Page_846">[Pg 846]</a></span></p>

<p>That a Protestant or a free-thinker
should encourage the "Friends
of Holland" in resisting the Holy
See, that he should even go so far
as to do honor to that resistance,
I can conceive; but that he should
share in the inveterate obstinacy
of the Jansenists concerning fact
and right defies logic and common
sense. M. Réville seems likewise
to confound the bull <cite>Unigenitus</cite>
with that of Alexander VII. concerning
the formulary. This leads
us to speak of the second point on
which the opposition of the clergy
of Utrecht to the Holy See is
founded.</p>

<p>The Jansenist discussions on <i lang="fr">le
fait</i> and <i lang="fr">le droit</i> were still proceeding,
when the patriarch of the sect,
the ex-Oratorian, Pasquier Quesnel,
threw off the mask, and in his <cite>Réflexions
Morales</cite> renewed the principal
dogmas of Baius and Jansenius.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>
Pope Clement XI. ordered
the book to be examined; he proceeded
in this affair, says Döllinger,
"with perfect prudence and deliberation.
The Jesuits had been
charged with being bitterly opposed
to the <cite>Réflexions</cite>; he chose examiners
from religious orders whose
teachings had the least affinity with
those of the Society of Jesus. He
himself presided at twenty-three
sessions of the examiners, and the
discussion lasted for nearly two
whole years.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> Finally, on the 8th
of September, 1713, the bull <cite>Unigenitus</cite>
appeared, condemning one
hundred and one propositions taken
from Quesnel's book. Among
them are some which at first sight
appeared inoffensive; but they cunningly
convey Jansenist error, and
intimately coalesce with the system;
in others, expressions are
skilfully worded to infect the reader
with prejudices against the
teachings or the general discipline
of the church; many clearly
announce the dogmas of Jansenius."<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>Here, seeing that the one hundred
and one propositions were
found word for word in the condemned
book, the distinction of
right and of fact (<i lang="fr">du droit et du
fait</i>) was impossible. Quesnel, on
hearing of the decree condemning
it, exclaimed: "The Pope has
proscribed one hundred and one
truths!" The whole party echoed
this exclamation, and our Netherland
sectaries followed the impulse
given by the patriarch of Jansenism.
This, then, in two words, is the attitude
of Jansenism in Holland: it
refuses to condemn the sense of
Jansenius by signature to the formulary
of Alexander VII.; it refuses
adherence to the bull <cite>Unigenitus</cite>.
All the efforts made by the Holy
See to bring back the Jansenists
of Utrecht to Catholic unity have
failed, from a persistence in this
double refusal. Among these efforts
at reconciliation, there is one
which deserves special mention.</p>

<p>In 1826, Mgr. Nazalli, Papal
nuncio, opened a conference with
the Holland Jansenists. He announced
to them that Rome exacted
of them nothing more than an
adhesion pure and simple to the
constitutions of Innocent X., Alexande<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_847" id="Page_847">[Pg 847]</a></span>r
VII., and Clement XI., and he
proposed for their signature the
formula previously referred to, with
the following addition: "I moreover
submit, without distinction, reticence,
or explanation, to the constitution
of Clement XI., dated
September 8, 1713, and beginning
with the word <em>Unigenitus</em>; I accept
it purely and simply, and
thus I swear. May God help me
and this holy Gospel!"<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>The bull <cite>Unigenitus</cite> was, even
under the Gallican point of view,
obligatory on all Catholics, since
it had been accepted by the entire
episcopate with that <em>moral unanimity</em>
of which so much was said about
the time of the last council. However,
the schismatic archbishop and
bishops of Holland declined the
overtures of the Sovereign Pontiff.
Their reply is a true model of
Jansenist style; every member of
a phrase hides a restriction or an
equivocation:</p>

<p>"We replied frankly (<em>honnêtement</em>)
that none of the bishops or
clergy would hesitate to recognize
with sincerity, by means of an unequivocal
declaration in <em>general</em><a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
terms, all that the Holy See <em>might</em>
exact on their part, and that they
would have no difficulty in declaring,
for example, that they agree,
and that they even swear, if needs
be, to accept, without any exception
whatever, all the articles of the
Holy Catholic faith: not to maintain
nor to teach, now or hereafter,
any opinions but those which have
been established, determined, and
published at all times by our holy
mother, the church, <em>conformably to
Scripture, tradition, the acts of œcumenical
councils, and, lastly, to that
of Trent</em>; that, besides, they especially
reprehend, reject, and condemn
the five propositions which
the Holy See has condemned, <em>and
which are pretended to be found
in the book of Jansenius, known as
the Augustinus</em>." All the rest is in
this spirit. But what follows was
quite unforeseen:</p>

<p>"We therefore leave it to the decision
of the world whether a declaration
so frank and so sincere ...
does not offer incontestable proof
of entire submission to the Holy
See; and whether the general terms
in which it is conceived do not
embrace all the specialties of which
acknowledgment can reasonably be
expected from us, but into the
details of which we are not permitted
to enter by citing bulls which
we cannot in conscience accept&mdash;bulls
which have not been recognized
by the government, and which
we are therefore not permitted to
mention without incurring grave
penalties.... It is, in fact, sufficiently
well known that the said constitutions
(of Innocent X., Alexander
VII., and Clement XI.) are not only
not adopted nor obligatory in several
countries, but that they cannot
be adopted or enforced in a country
where they have never received
the <i lang="la">placet</i> of the government, and
where their acceptance as such is
interdicted under threat of severe
punishments. In the northern
countries, to the jurisdiction of
which the clergy of Utrecht belonged,
such acceptance was strictly
forbidden by the edicts of the 24th
February and 25th May, 1703, the
14th December, 1708, and of the
20th and 21st September, 1730&mdash;edicts
in which the principle was
established <em>that it belongs to the sovereign
alone to permit the publication
and execution of such bulls</em>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_848" id="Page_848">[Pg 848]</a></span>
that without his <em>visa</em> or <i lang="la">placet</i> neither
is permitted."<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>Can one imagine baser or more
servile language? In presence of
a heterodox power, the pretended
successors of S. Boniface, of the
martyrs and victims of Calvinist
persecution, dare to take sides with
power, and to concede to it a right
to dominate over faith and ecclesiastical
discipline! At that very
time William I. was oppressing his
Catholic subjects, and endeavoring
to deprive the bishops of the right
of bringing up in their seminaries
young aspirants to the priesthood.
Need it be added that no law in
vigor in 1826 interdicted the acceptance
pure and simple of the Apostolical
Constitutions of Alexander
VII. and Clement XI.?</p>

<p>The Revolution had overridden
ancient laws, and not a single Catholic
was molested on account of
his adhesion to the decrees of the
Holy See. But the worship of the
state as God makes progress in
proportion as respect for the church
is banished. For a bishop especially
independence is impossible;
when he refuses to walk in the royal
way of submission to the Vicar
of Christ, he becomes, by a just
punishment, the plaything of a
party or the slave of the secular
power.</p>

<p>And this is the church which the
neo-Protestants declare is calumniated
when the accusation of Jansenism
is brought against it; the
church which, infected with this
poison at the very sources whence
it poured itself abroad on the world,
has always kept its arms open to
receive the followers of Jansenius;
which has always shown its readiness
to sign formularies like those
of Quesnel and Ricci, and has
obstinately rejected the profession
of Catholic faith; this, in fine, is
the church which precipitated itself
into schism in order to remain
faithful to the errors of Jansenius,
and of Saint-Cyran, and of Quesnel!</p>

out, "Truth, truth!" but who ever have

<h4>II.</h4>

<p>Leaving Christ's Hospital, and
rambling on, one soon comes to a
church partly covered with ivy, in
a yard filled with shrubbery and
autumn flowers. It is S. Sepulchre's,
the burial-place of Captain
John Smith, the Virginia pioneer.
It is almost a sacred duty to pay
a passing tribute to his memory,
notwithstanding a lifelong grudge
against him for not rounding off his
romantic career by wedding the
dusky Pocahontas. The clock of
this church has the sad distinction
of regulating the hanging of criminals
at Newgate. The tower has
four pinnacles, each one bearing a
vane with its own notions as to
rectitude, which has given rise to
the saying that "unreasonable people
are as hard to reconcile as the
vanes of S. Sepulchre's tower, which
never looked all four upon one
point of the heavens."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_849" id="Page_849">[Pg 849]</a></span></p>

<p>In old times, the bell of this
church was tolled as criminals
passed to Tyburn, and the bell-man
cried: "All good people, pray
heartily unto God for these poor
sinners, who are now going to their
death;" for which he received the
sum of one pound, six shillings, and
eight pence. A hand-bell was likewise
rung for them to stop for a
nosegay of flowers. It must have
been a great consolation to them!
And yet who knows but such silent
messengers of God might not have
spoken to many a heart inaccessible
to human tongue?</p>

<p>In the XVIIth century a legacy
of fifty pounds was left to S. Sepulchre's
on condition that, before
execution-day, some one should go
to Newgate in the dead of night,
and give twelve solemn tolls with a
hand-bell by way of calling attention
to the following appeal:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"All you that in the condemned hole do lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prepare you, for to-morrow you must die:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watch, all, and pray, the hour is drawing near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That you before the Almighty must appear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Examine well yourselves, in time repent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That you may not t' eternal flames be sent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when S. Sepulchre's bell to-morrow tolls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Lord have mercy on your souls!<br /></span>
<span class="i18">Past twelve o'clock!"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Plucking an ivy-leaf from the
wall of S. Sepulchre's, our pilgrim
kept on his way. West Smithfield
at the corner of a street brought
our friend Fox and his martyrs to
mind, and he turned down towards
the square where John Rogers met
his fate. A tablet of Scotch granite
fastened to the wall of S. Bartholomew's
Hospital marks the
spot. This tablet is protected by a
grating, the upright rods of which
terminate in gilded flames of most
portentous brightness. He did not
see any such tablet around London
recording the numberless Catholic
martyrs of Henry VIII. and Queen
Elizabeth's time.</p>

<p>No dispassionate reader of history
can regard the church as responsible
for the sufferings of the so-called
"Marian Martyrs." But let
us thank God that such severe penalties
are now obsolete in Catholic
and Protestant lands alike!</p>

<p>Smithfield was the ordinary place
of execution before Tyburn was
used. The patriot Wallace was
executed here on S. Bartholomew's
eve, 1305. Shakespeare makes
Henry V. say: "The witch in
Smithfield shall be burned to
ashes." In Henry VIII.'s time,
poisoners were here boiled to death,
as the old chronicles of the Grey
Friars testify. Here is one quotation:
"The x day of March was
a mayde boyllyd in Smythfelde for
poysing of divers persons." Evelyn
records as late as 1652: "Passing
by Smithfield, I saw a miserable
creature burning, who had poisoned
her husband."</p>

<p>But there are pleasanter memories
connected with Smithfield, or
Smoothfield, as it was originally
called. It was once a famous tilting-ground.
Froissart tells us how
in 1393 "certain lords of Scotland
came into England to get worship
by force of arms in Smithfield."
Here Edward III. celebrated the
victories of Cressy and Poitiers by
jousts and feats of arms; and
Richard II., at the time of his marriage,
ordered here a tournament
of three days.</p>

<p>Passing through Smithfield market,
one soon comes to the Charter
House (a corruption of the French
word Chartreuse), the old monastery
of the Carthusians. The arched
gateway is the original entrance
into the realm of silence of those
old monks. Over it two lions
grotesquely carved support an en-tablature.
The lion is typical of
solitude and the wilderness, and is
often found represented beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_850" id="Page_850">[Pg 850]</a></span>
the hermits of the desert. A porter
leads the way at once to the
chapel by a passage paved with
tombstones and hung with memorial
tablets. One familiar name
on the wall makes the heart leap,
though a modern name:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gulielmus Makepeace Thackeray,
Carthusiani Carthusiano.</span></p>

<p class="center">H. M. P. C.</p>

<p class="center">Natus, MDCCCXI. Obiit, MDCCCLXIII.</p>

<p class="center">Alumnus, MDCCCXXII-MDCCCXXVI.
</p>

<p>Beside this white marble slab is
one precisely like it in memory of
John Leech.</p>

<p>The Elizabethan chapel is solemn
and interesting with its dark oaken
pews, its arched roof, on the keystones
of which are carved the
Charter House arms, and the monumental
tombs here and there. A
bright coal-fire in an open grate
gives it a comfortable, homelike
aspect that must be grateful to the
aged pensioners. And there are
hassocks of straw for them all to
kneel upon. Over one of the doors
is an arch of modern stained glass,
but with colors of unusual richness,
or seemed so, coming in from the
neutral tints of a dense fog. There
is Magdalen with her golden hair,
and the other Maries, with beautiful
faces and purple, red, and
amber robes.</p>

<p>At the north of the chancel is the
tomb of Thomas Sutton, the founder
of the Charter House Hospital,
in the style of James I.'s reign. He
lies, cut in marble, on a marble
tomb, with ruff and long gown, and
hands folded palm to palm as peacefully
as if they never itched to acquire
riches. Two men in armor
support an inscription attesting his
beneficence. Some persons of a
qualifying turn do say that he was,
like many others who are very
charitable with their money when
they see the impossibility of keeping
it any longer in their grasp,
guilty of what has been called the
"good old gentlemanly vice of
avarice," and was the original of
<cite>Volpone the Fox</cite>. However that
may be, the many who are sheltered
here have reason to roar as loudly
as they can, and as we are told they
do, on the 12th of December, with
cracked voices and half-palsied
tongues, the chorus of the Carthusian
melody:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then blessed be the memory<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of good old Thomas Sutton,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who gave us lodging&mdash;learning,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And he gave us beef and mutton."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Catholics, however, cannot forget
that when young he took part in
the Italian wars, and was present at
the sacking of Rome. At a later
period he commanded a battery as
a volunteer at the siege of Edinburgh,
when that city held out for
poor Queen Mary. And he aided
in the expedition against the Spanish
Armada by fitting out a ship
named Sutton for himself, which
captured a Spanish vessel worth
twenty thousand pounds. When
he came to London to reside, it
was reported that his purse was
fuller than Queen Elizabeth's exchequer,
and in time he became
the banker of London, and had the
freedom of the city.</p>

<p>On the 12th of December there
is a great festival here in honor of
the <em>Fundator</em>, and before it is over
the pensioners and school-boys assemble
in the chapel, which is lighted,
as Thackeray tells, "so the
founder's tomb, with its grotesque
carvings, monsters, and heraldries,
darkles and shines with the most
wonderful shadows and lights."</p>

<p>At the south end of the chapel is
a fine statue of Lord Ellenborough
by Chantrey, in a sitting posture,
robed as chief-justice. He was
buried here at his own request, hav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_851" id="Page_851">[Pg 851]</a></span>ing
been educated in the Charter
House, and one of its governors.</p>

<p>As at Christ's Hospital, the visitor
is allowed to wander alone
through cloisters and quadrangles,
as hushed and peaceful as when occupied
by the Carthusians themselves.
The pensioners (the school
has been removed) seem to lead a
kind of friar-life here, and in their
seclusion ought to taste something
of the peace of the cloister. They
only lack the consecration of religion.
One of them in cloak and
cap came up, bowing with remarkable
flexion of body considering his
years, and politely offered to show
the way with quite an air of proprietorship.
His manner was gentlemanly,
and he looked as if he might
be some "disabled invalide from
the campaign of vanity." In these
days, when old people are apt to be
regarded as unduly persistent about
living, it is delightful to feel there
are places of refuge for them like
this, which confer a kind of dignity
on fallen fortunes and declining life
which is always a certain going
down in the world.</p>

<p>We wonder if there is any service
in the English ritual when
these old gentlemen take shelter
here. There surely ought to be.
Some <i lang="la">Vade in pace</i> ought to follow
them under these arches, dying
away little by little with the hours
and fragrance of life, and leaving
behind silence and repose of soul.</p>

<p>There is a touching custom here
of giving the bell at night a number
of strokes corresponding to the
number of pensioners; and when
one of them dies, his decease is
notified by one stroke less than on
the preceding evening. It was at
the evening hour, as the chapel-bell
began to toll, that Col. Newcome
lifted up his head, said <em>Adsum</em> with
a smile, and died.</p>

<p>A bell like this must always have
a knell-like solemnity of tone. It
is a kind of curfew-bell, reminding
the brothers that the evening of
life has come, and its fires must be
put out before lying down to rest.
We can fancy them counting the
strokes one by one every night, to
learn if some light is for ever extinguished.
The thought often occurs
how we old people will find heaven&mdash;whether
a place all youth, and
freshness, and beauty. Are there to
be no shades and gradations in
Paradise, no stars differing from
one another in glory, or faces in
sweetness and serenity? Are the
very angels that are to minister to
us there all so full of grace and
loveliness, and perfection of form,
and crowned with everlasting
youth? "Will there not be some
comforting ones, shabby and tender,
whose radiance does not dazzle
nor bewilder; whose faces are worn
perhaps, while their stars shine with
a gentle, tremulous light more
soothing to our earth-bound hearts
than the glorious radiance of
brighter spirits?" Who that is old
and sorrow-stricken, or belongs to
the poor and unloved ones of this
world, does not feel the need of
some such spirits to greet him
there&mdash;need of some shadowy,
sequestered spot where the brightness
and love of that ineffable region
will be tempered for us who
have had but little cheer on earth,
at least till our unaccustomed souls
are fitted for loftier heights?</p>

<p>Many such&mdash;perhaps too human&mdash;dreams
of heaven flitted across
the mind while sitting on a bench
beside some old graves in a yard
at the Charter House that gloomy
afternoon. Weary with climbing
old staircases, going through old
passages and old halls, where one
only breathed the atmosphere of old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_852" id="Page_852">[Pg 852]</a></span>
times, perhaps the soul had become
infected by the gloom of the place.</p>

<p>Borders of dull chrysanthemums
grew along the gravelled walks&mdash;apparently
a favorite flower in England,
for they are to be found
everywhere. A few trees with
blighted leaves, instead of bright
autumn foliage as in America, stood
around with nothing in the world
to do but look well, any more than
Voltaire's trees, but, like many poor
mortals, did not succeed very well.
They looked weary of the struggle,
and had a certain bowed, resigned
look that was pathetic. How could
anything look fresh and vigorous in
that field of death? One cannot
imagine the place peopled with
boys full of life and fun, as it used
to be.</p>

<p>The land on which the Charter
House stands was a graveyard at
the time of the great plague, five
hundred years ago, being consecrated
to that purpose by Bishop Stratford,
of London, in 1348. Distressed
that so many of his flock should
be buried out of consecrated ground
during the prevalence of the plague,
he bought three acres of land called
"No Man's Land" for a burial-ground,
and erected a chapel thereon,
where Masses could be said for
the repose of the dead. The place
became known as Pardon Churchyard
and Chapel. We read of an
early instance of lynching on No
Man's Land previous to this time.
A wealthy merchant, one Anthony
of Spain, so exasperated the public
by an excessive duty on wine that
a mob dragged him barefoot to this
spot, and here beheaded him, in
November, 1326&mdash;doubtless on just
such a dismal, foggy day as this, supremely
adapted to give one desperate
views, and aggravate the natural
ferocity of the human animal.</p>

<p>The plague continuing to increase,
the churchyard was enlarged
through the charity of Sir
Walter Manny, of knightly fame,
who purchased a piece of land adjoining.
An old ballad says:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thou, Walter Manny, Cambray's lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bravest man those times record,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Didst pity take on the wand'ring ghosts<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of thy departed friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Didst consecrate to the Lord of Hosts<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy substance for religious ends."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The next Bishop of London,
Michael de Northburg, when he
died, in 1361, bequeathed two thousand
pounds, with all his leases,
rents, and tenements, towards the
foundation of a Carthusian monastery
at Pardon Churchyard, together
with an enamelled vessel of
silver for the Host, another for holy
water, a silver bell, and all his theological
works. Sir Walter Manny,
desirous of co-operating in this
work, petitioned for a royal license
to build a monastery here, to be
called "The House of the Salutation
of the Mother of God," and gave to
it the land he had bought for a graveyard,
consisting of thirteen acres
and one rod. Sir Walter's charter
was witnessed by the Earl of Pembroke,
Edward Mortimer, Earl of
March, and others. The monastery
was completed in 1370, and
was the fourth of the Carthusian
Order in England.</p>

<p>The London Charter House was
furthermore endowed by several
other persons. Two hundred and
sixty marks were bestowed in perpetual
frank-almoign to build a cell
for a monk who should offer daily
suffrages for the souls of Thomas
Aubrey and Felicia his wife, as well
as all the faithful departed. Richard
Clyderhowe, in 1418, gave up,
"from reverence to God and the
Blessed Virgin Mary, and for the
health of his own soul and that
of his wife Alicia, who was buried
in the church of the convent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_853" id="Page_853">[Pg 853]</a></span>
a lease of land he held in Rochester,
that these religious might,
in their orisons, remember him, his
soul, the soul of his wife, the souls
of his relations, children, and all his
benefactors, and devoutly recommend
them to God."</p>

<p>It is pleasant to find the Charter
House interchanging charitable offices
with its neighbor, the priory
of S. John of Jerusalem. They exchange
lands, and the prior of the
Charter House offers a trental of
Masses "that the soul of Brother
William Hulles, Prior of the Hospital
of S. John of Jerusalem, might
the sooner be conveyed, with God's
providence, into Abraham's bosom."</p>

<p>In the XVth century the Charter
House became, for the space of
four years, the residence of Sir
Thomas More, who here gave himself
up to devotion and prayer without
taking upon himself any vow.</p>

<p>This monastery flourished about
three centuries with a constant reputation
for strict observance of the
rules of the order and for holiness
of life. It was during the time
of Prior John Houghton, in 1534,
that it was visited by the royal
commissioners appointed by Henry
VIII. to inspect all the monasteries
of the kingdom, and draw up an
account of their rules, customs, and
revenues.</p>

<p>Most of the monks refused to
subscribe to the king's supremacy,
and the prior and procurator were
committed to the Tower. They
afterwards yielded to advice which
they respected, but, suspected of
disaffection, were summoned to renew
the oath, and the prior was arraigned
for speaking too freely of
the king's proceedings, and, with
two other Carthusians, was condemned
to be hung, drawn, and
quartered at Tyburn for refusing
to acknowledge the king head of
the church in England. As they
were leaving the Tower to be executed,
they were perceived by Sir
Thomas More, imprisoned there
for the same reason, who said to
his favorite daughter, as if envying
them: "Lo, dost thou not see,
Meg, that these blessed fathers be
now as cheerfully going to their
deaths as bridegrooms to their marriage?"
This was not long before his
own martyrdom. There is at the
South Kensington Museum a painting
of Sir Thomas and his daughter,
depicting this very scene. He stands
looking down through the grated
window. Margaret, tall and stately,
with her father's left hand in
hers, has her deep violet eyes raised
steadfastly to heaven with the
most appealing expression; her
whole face calm and holy, but inexpressibly
sad.</p>

<p>The heads of these monks were
suspended over London Bridge&mdash;a
bridge built, too, by religious&mdash;and
Prior Houghton's mangled body was
hung up over the gate of the Charter
House. The next month three
more monks of this house were executed
for a like reason, and the
remainder were called upon three
times in one year to take the oath
of supremacy&mdash;a proof that they
were regarded as specially loyal to
the pope. Of the ten who had
subscribed two years before, nine
now refused, and were committed to
prison at Newgate, where they were
chained in a filthy dungeon and
starved to death. Their end was
announced to Cromwell as "by the
hand of God." Their keeper,
Bedyll, gave him a list of these poor
martyrs, adding: "There be one
hole." This <em>whole</em> one survived
an imprisonment of four years, only
to be executed at last.</p>

<p>All this did not take place with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_854" id="Page_854">[Pg 854]</a></span>out
some supernatural manifestations
to fortify the poor monks.
It is recorded that "unearthly
lights were seen in their church,"
and, at the burial of one of their
number, all the lamps of the church
were miraculously lighted, and one
of the deceased brethren appeared
to the monk who had nursed him
in his last illness, saying that "the
angells of pease did lamment and
murn w<sup>t</sup>owt measur," and that
my "lord of Rochester" and "o<sup>r</sup>
Father" (Houghton) were "next
unto angells in hevyn."</p>

<p>The remainder of the English
Carthusians went to Bruges, where
they remained till the accession of
Mary, who, at the suggestion of
Philip, it is said, invited them back,
and gave them the old Carthusian
monastery at Shene, near Richmond.
They were exiled again in
Elizabeth's reign, and returned to
Belgium.</p>

<p>The south wall of the present
chapel formed part of the old
church in which were buried Sir
Walter Manny, and Margaret his
wife, and many other knights and
dames. Prior Houghton's remains
are supposed to be buried somewhere
within the wall now marked
by a cross and a huge I. H. It is
recorded of him that he was so
meek and humble that if any one
addressed him as "my lord," or
with any unusual deference, he immediately
rebuked him, saying:
"It is not lawful for poor Carthusian
monks to make broad their
phylacteries, or to be called rabbi
by their fellow-men."</p>

<p>The Charter House was given to
John Bridges, yeoman, and Thomas
Hale, groom, as a reward for the
safe keeping of the king's tents and
pavilions which had been deposited
here, but it afterwards passed
through several hands. While
owned by Lord North, Queen Elizabeth
spent four days here, which so
diminished his lordship's resources
that he was obliged to live in retirement
the rest of his life. James
I. also passed a few days here when
it was in possession of Lord Thomas
Howard, in order to show his
respect for a family that had aided
and suffered for his mother. While
here, he knighted more than eighty
gentlemen&mdash;let us hope less awkwardly
than he knighted Sir Richard
Monopilies, of Castle Collop!</p>

<p>The Charter House was finally
purchased by Thomas Sutton, the
founder of the hospital. It is delightful
to step from the noise and
bustle of the streets into these secluded
courts with grass-plots to
refresh the eye, lime-trees to give
shade, here a fountain in the midst
of a garden, and there some old
tombs, perhaps of the monks; on
this wall some holy symbol left
here ages ago, but not in vain, for
it still speaks to the heart; and
scattered around are seats for the
pensioners to enjoy the sun and
air.</p>

<p>The kitchen fireplace is capacious
enough to roast fifteen surloins.
What extensive means are
always used to provide for the body
which perisheth! If at least equal
provision were made, as in the
times of the old monks, to supply
the needs of the soul! Does that
get its three meals a day, and now
and then a lunch or some refreshing
draught? Are there none who
labor day after day to supply the
soul's hunger, as multitudes do to
satisfy the cravings of the body?
Yes, thank God! there is still an
army of such spiritual people in the
cloister and in the world, who only
live to feed their higher natures.
If they care for the body, it is
merely enough to enable it to serve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_855" id="Page_855">[Pg 855]</a></span>
the soul. The world may call them
"drones," but they are necessary in
order to preserve the moral balance
of the world, as an offset to the
materiality of the day. Yes, the
hermit, the contemplative, contributes
in his degree to sustain the
world, and this is why the suppression
of such a class is an irreparable
loss to society.</p>

<h3>A BLOCK OF GOLD.</h3>


<p>"France paid the Prussian indemnity
like a proud debtor; it seemingly
did not cost her any trouble to do
so. Few nations could do as France
has done within the past two years;
none have ever excelled her in cancelling
a monetary obligation." One
hears such remarks occasionally;
they were quite common a few
months past. But what was the
French indemnity? Five milliards
of francs&mdash;that is, five thousand millions
of francs, or one thousand millions
of dollars in gold! To think
of the sum is to make one feel covetous
of a chip of the block; to see
the whole sum in one block of gold is
almost enough to make one cry out
with Timon&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<span class="i7">... "Thou valiant Mars!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou ever young, fresh, lov'd, and delicate wooer."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>"<i lang="fr">Ce que c'est que cinq milliards en
or monnaye!</i>"</p>

<p>Well, we did not exactly know what
five milliards of francs in gold or
copper were. The cool February
evening in the year of grace 1873,
we were accosted in front of No.&mdash;
Boulevard St. Denis by the above
question. At the same time a polite
French boy hands us a handbill,
which told us that <i lang="fr">un bloc d'or</i>, eight
metres long, five metres high, and
three and two-third metres deep,
could be seen for fifty centimes&mdash;ten
cents. This cube of one hundred
and fifty metres contained one hundred
thousand <i lang="fr">rouleaux</i> of fifty thousand
francs each; each one of the
rolls&mdash;<i lang="fr">rouleaux</i>&mdash;contained two thousand
five hundred pieces of twenty
francs, and the whole two hundred
and fifty million (250,000,000) pieces.</p>

<p>We paid the admission fee, and
were ushered into the room where
the gilded cube stood. A stout lady
sat near the door knitting; the master
of ceremonies was young and thin.
We were the only visitor at 8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>
on the evening of February, 1873.
We surveyed the cube, and admired
the ingenuity displayed in its
make-up; but it occurred to us at the
time that, as a speculation, it was a
failure. People, I thought, who have
to pay a large debt don't care about
being told the length, breadth, and
height of their indebtedness; that it
would be, perhaps, a success at Berlin.
We thanked the thin master
of ceremonies for his attention, respectfully
bowed to the stout woman
plying her knitting-needles; and
walked along the boulevard with our
back to the Pont St. Denis, asking
ourselves what we could or would do
with one or five milliards of dollars.</p>

<p>The other day we saw an old copy
of the New Orleans <cite>Propagateur Catholique</cite>.
It contained an article on
the five milliards, which it credits to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_856" id="Page_856">[Pg 856]</a></span>
the Christian Brothers&mdash;<cite>Les Frères
des Ecoles Chrétiennes</cite>. It recalled
our ten-cent investment of last February,
and is so interesting, especially
to all who are mathematically inclined,
that we translate it.</p>

<p>In bank-notes of one thousand
francs, the weight of each note being
estimated at two grams,<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> the five
milliards in paper would weigh ten
thousand kilograms;<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> in gold, one
million six hundred and twelve thousand
nine hundred; in silver, twenty-five
millions; in copper, five hundred
millions. It would take one hundred
men to carry the five milliards in
bank-notes of one thousand francs
each, allowing one hundred kilograms
to each man; sixteen thousand
one hundred and twenty-nine,
in gold; two hundred and fifty thousand,
in silver; five million, in copper.
It would take a man to count
the five milliards, at the rate of ten
hours per day, and counting every
minute sixty notes of one thousand
francs&mdash;fifty pieces of twenty francs,
sixty pieces of one franc, sixty
pieces of five centimes&mdash;to count the
notes, four months and nineteen
days; the gold, nineteen years and
ten days; the silver, three hundred
and eighty years, six months, and
eight days; the copper, seven thousand
six hundred and ten years, four
months, and seven days.</p>

<p>To remove this great sum of money
in bank-bills one wagon would suffice,
it being capable of bearing ten
thousand kilograms; in gold, one
hundred and sixty-one and one-third
wagons; in silver, two thousand five
hundred; in copper, fifty thousand.
Allowing ten metres<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> to each wagon,
those carrying the gold would extend
sixteen hundred and ten metres;
the silver, twenty-five thousand metres;
the copper, five hundred thousand
metres.</p>

<p>Placing the notes of one thousand
francs one upon another, and giving
each one a space of one tenth of a
millimetre,<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> they would ascend to a
height of five hundred metres. The
diameter of the five-franc piece being
equal to thirty-seven millimetres,
the five milliards placed in the same
direction, side to side, would form a
chain thirty-seven millions of metres
in length&mdash;almost the circumference
of the earth, which is forty millions.
With one-franc pieces placed
as the preceding, they would encircle
the globe twice and seven-eighths;
with fifty centimes&mdash;ten-cent
pieces&mdash;four times and one-half;
with sous&mdash;cents&mdash;sixty-two times
and one-half!</p>

<p>The Franco-Prussian war did not
commence till July, 1870. Inside of
three years the greatest of modern
battles have been lost and won, and
the heaviest fine ever laid upon a
nation paid, and without interfering
with the commercial classes or any
important interest or branch of business
in the fair land. Great in
science, in war, in religion, she has
given the world a proof of her magnificent
resources, and that her children
are still proud of <i lang="fr">la belle France</i>,
and filled with the "<i lang="fr">sacré amour de
la patrie</i>."</p>

<h3>NEW PUBLICATIONS.</h3>


<div class="hangindent">

<p><span class="smcap">Louise Lateau of Bois d'Haine: her
Life, her Ecstasies, and her Stigmata.</span>
A Medical Study. By Dr. F.
Lefebvre, Professor of General Pathology
and Therapeutics in the Catholic
University of Louvain, Honorary
Physician to the Lunatic Establishment
in that town, Titular Member of the Royal
Academy of Medicine of Belgium.
Edited by J. Spencer Northcote, D.D.
London: Burns &amp; Oates. 1873. (New
York: Sold by The Catholic Publication
Society.)</p></div>

<p>We enjoy very much the chagrin and
discomfiture of sceptical physicians, scientists,
and other materialists, both
learned and vulgar, in view of the great
number of preternatural facts, both divine
and diabolical, which have been
thrust upon their unwilling sight during
this present half-century. Heaven and
hell appear to rival each other in startling
the shallow self-complacency and
incredulity of the hard-headed set who
have filled the world with their boastful
pretence to have overcome the superstitions
of ages by their experiments and
inductions. They have tried hard to
ignore all the supernatural or preternatural
facts and phenomena of the mystic
order which have multiplied around
them and challenged their investigation.
But this proves to be a signal failure.
Especially when men who belong to
their own professional fraternity, whose
learning and ability in their own class of
sciences are undoubted, exhibit the results
of careful study and investigation
by means of experiment and induction
from observed facts, as proving, on their
own principles, the folly of their stubborn
unbelief, do they cut a very sorry figure
by persisting in ignoring and giving the
<em>transeat</em> to that which will not be ignored
or passed over. The puerile banalities
in vogue, such as "manifest imposture,"
"unscientific absurdity," "something
which no intelligent person can believe,"
merely show to what straits the individuals
are reduced who are forced to use
them. They are like allusions to the
color of an opponent's hair, or the shape
of his nose, or the behavior of his relatives.</p>

<p>The effort at some kind of scientific explanation
of the strange phenomena of
spiritism, or the wonders of the divine
mystical order which the former class of
manifestations ape, which is occasionally
attempted, fares no better. It breaks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_858" id="Page_858">[Pg 858]</a></span>
down at a certain point. Up to that
point there is a common ground of
physiology, psychology, and the higher
spiritual science; and many things which
appear to be beyond natural power or
law may be explained and accounted
for without supposing preternatural
causes. But, ill-defined and uncertain
as the boundary line may be, there is one,
and one cannot pass it very far without
being aware of the fact. We do not
complain of scientists for being critical
and difficult in respect to facts and evidence.
We do not, in reference to the
present case, inculpate their refusal to
believe on motives of pure faith. The
charge against them is that they are
recreant to their own avowed method of
investigation by experiment, observation,
and induction.</p>

<p>No one can prove this so conclusively,
or rout them so completely on their own
ground, as one of themselves, who is
conversant with physics, and at the same
time has some logic, philosophy, and
sound theology in his head; in a word,
is, what they are not, a completely educated
man. The volume before us is a
specimen of what we are speaking of.
We need not enlarge on the case of
Louise Lateau, of which we have spoken
before, and which is generally known.
Sufficient to say that the book before us
is a treatise on her remarkable ecstasies
and stigmata by a physician, and written
after the method of medical science,
which establishes beyond a doubt their
miraculous cause and origin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Holy Mass</span>: The Sacrifice for the
Living and the Dead. By Michael
Müller, Priest of the Congregation of
the Most Holy Redeemer. New York
and Cincinnati: F. Pustet. 1874.</p></div>

<p>This is a work written in the true
spirit of S. Alphonsus. It is not a reprint
of the work entitled <cite>The Holy Eucharist
our Greatest Treasure</cite>, by the same
author, but an entirely new treatise. Its
theology is sound and solid, its spirit
most devout, and its style simple and
popular. It is surprising that so hard-working
a priest as F. Müller has been
able to write so many excellent and edifying
books, in a language, too, which is
to him a foreign tongue. Every pious
Catholic who reads this book will be
charmed with it, and will find it most instructive
and profitable. We are happy
to be able to give it our unqualified
commendation, and to recommend it in
the most earnest manner to all the faithful,
as well as to Protestants who are
seeking for the truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Life of the Ven. Anna Maria
Taigi.</span> Edited by Edward Healy
Thompson, M.A. London: Burns &amp;
Oates; New York: F. Pustet. 1874.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Thompson's biographies are of the
first class in every respect. This one has
a special interest on account of the relation
which the life and prophecies of the
venerable Roman matron sustain to recent
and pending events of the greatest
moment in human history. It is unfortunate
that a most meagre and imperfect
life of Anna Maria Taigi, which contains
serious misstatements, afterwards discovered
and regretted by the author, Mgr.
Leuquet, has been already translated and
circulated in this country. That life
states that its subject fell into a grievous
sin against her marriage vows, and remained
without confession for a considerable
time afterwards. This is proved
to be false, and the fact is fully established
that Anna Maria was pious and irreproachable
throughout her whole life,
and especially so during her whole career
as a wife and the mother of a large family.</p>

<p>Apart from her supernatural gifts, the
sanctity and virtue displayed by this
wonderful and admirable matron, in a
laborious and humble sphere, present a
most beautiful picture and a most engaging
example to woman in the married
state.</p>

<p>The extraordinary graces granted to
Anna Maria Taigi, her supernatural
knowledge, and her remarkable predictions,
have made her name famous
throughout the world. This part of his
subject Mr. Thompson has treated fully
and judiciously. The exact fulfilment of
the predictions she is known to have
made of events already passed, especially
those relating to Pius IX., who was
elevated to the pontifical throne nine
years after her death, has awakened a
most intense curiosity respecting some
others attributed to her regarding the
present time and the approaching future.
These are under the hands of the commission
engaged with the process of her
beatification, and have not been officially
published. Those which are certainly
known are inserted in the <cite>Life</cite>, and
others, which are probably genuine, are
added in the appendix.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_859" id="Page_859">[Pg 859]</a></span></p>

<p>The appendix closes with the following
very apposite remarks, extracted from an
extremely able and interesting article on
modern current prophecies which appeared
some time ago in the <cite>Civiltà Cattolica</cite>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It cannot be denied that the agreement
of so many and various presages in divining
events the expectation of which is in
the hearts of the greater number of Catholics,
possesses a persuasive force, and is a
kind of seal of high probability, if not
certainty. Wise Christians are unanimous
in admitting that the church is a
prey to a diabolical and universal persecution
hitherto unexampled; wherefore
God must come to her aid with succors
proportioned to the need, that is extraordinary.
We find ourselves in this extreme
case: that the salvation of society,
no less than of the church, requires an
unaccustomed intervention of Omnipotent
power. If this be so, how should
we not believe that come it will?"</p></div>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><span class="smcap">Pleadings of the Sacred Heart of
Jesus.</span> From the French, with Introduction
by a Catholic Priest. New
York: The Catholic Publication Society.
1874.</p></div>

<p>This little work bears the imprimatur
of Cardinal Cullen. The introduction
states the devotion to the Sacred Heart
succinctly. The work itself consists of a
reading for every day in the month.
Each reading contains an instruction followed
by a "reflection" and a "practice,"
together with a suitable example. Everything
is excellent. We most warmly recommend
the book to all who have or
wish to acquire true devotion to the Sacred
Heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lenten Sermons.</span> By Paul Segneri, of
the Society of Jesus. Vol. II. New
York: The Catholic Publication Society.
1874.</p></div>

<p>The present volume seems to us to
contain a better selection of sermons
than the one published two years ago.
Those on "Avoiding the Occasions of
Sin," on "Gaining a Brother," on "The
Love of God in Afflicting us," on "The
Cure of Disquieting Thoughts about
Predestination," and "Encouragement
to the Greatest Sinners to become the
Greatest Saints," are perhaps especially
remarkable. A translation necessarily
labors under some disadvantages, but
we think that the work has really been
well done in the present case, and that
small blemishes and misconceptions of
the author's meaning are not more frequent
than must always be expected
when a work is rendered from one language
into another. The English style
of the book is good.</p>

<p>All those who have the first volume
will, we think, desire to supply themselves
with the second; and those who
get the second will no doubt send for the
first also. Another volume, to complete
the set, will, we believe, be prepared.</p>

Templemore. With a Preface by His
Grace the Most Rev. Dr. Leahy, Archbishop
of Cashel. New York: P. M.
Haverty. 1874.</p></div>

<p>Though several very good manuals of
devotion to the Blessed Sacrament have
lately appeared, this little book will not
be a superfluity. It seems to us the most
practical of them all, and the best calculated
to induce the faithful to frequently
hear Mass and worthily receive Holy
Communion. In these latter days of the
world and of the church, the sacraments
are more than ever the special channels
of God's grace, and every word tending
to increase devotion to the Most Holy
Eucharist is peculiarly valuable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Memorial of Thomas Ewing of Ohio.</span>
New York: The Catholic Publication
Society. 1873.</p></div>

<p>Without being a formal biography, this
book presents us with the leading and
many of the minor incidents in the life
of an eminent statesman and jurist covering
a period of over fourscore years.
The scope of the work embraces an autobiography,
a brief biography by the
Hon. Henry Stanbery, and a judicious
collocation of original letters and selections
from current journals, thus enabling
the reader to trace with little difficulty
the various stages of a remarkable
career, and form an estimate of an equally
remarkable character. The value of the
volume is enhanced by some delicate
sketches, original and selected, prepared
by the daughter of the subject, and editor
of the <cite>Memorial</cite>, Mrs. Ellen Ewing Sherman,
wife of Gen. W. T. Sherman.</p>

<p>The life of Thomas Ewing furnishes a
very interesting study to the rising youth
of our country, showing, as it does, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_860" id="Page_860">[Pg 860]</a></span>
great difficulties may be overcome by industry
and perseverance, how purity of
character and a noble ambition win enduring
fame, and, above all, how one who
was singularly free from the corruptions
of worldly prosperity, and undebased by
the temptations of power, found at last
the grace and strength which the sacraments
of the church impart.</p>

<p>The child of an industrious frontiersman,
whose first lessons were conned by
the light of a pine knot, and whose primary
education was paid for by his labor
as a salt-boiler in Virginia, Mr. Ewing
rose to the first rank at the American
bar, was twice elected United States
senator, and made a member of two successive
Cabinets. Without wealth or
friends, but with what to him was better,
brains, industry, and an unstained reputation,
he ascended to some of the
highest positions in the land, and left
them with ever-increasing honor. As a
lawyer, he stood at the head of his profession
before half his life was spent; in
the Senate, he was the compeer of Webster✠
Calhoun, Clay, and Benton; as Secretary
of the Treasury under Harrison, and of the
Interior under Taylor, his foresight, honesty,
and executive ability were freely
and fully acknowledged by his associates.</p>

<p>But great as was his life&mdash;if genius
and goodness constitute greatness&mdash;he
was even greater in his death. For nearly
forty years he had been contemplating
the possibility of becoming a Catholic;
for, though entertaining a profound respect
for Christians of all denominations,
he could not satisfy his acute and logical
mind with the teachings of any of the
sects. It was, however, only a week before
his death that the grace of communion
was vouchsafed him, and then, at his own
request, he was admitted into the church,
and shortly before his death received the
last sacraments from the hands of the
Most Rev. Archbishop Purcell, of Cincinnati.
His long years of conscientious
study and examination, his sincere prayers
and unostentatious charity, were at
length rewarded, and he was made a
child of the church to which his beloved
wife (long since deceased) belonged, and
of which his children are faithful members.
In these days of doubt and official
dishonesty, few better examples could be
held before the coming statesmen of the
country.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
